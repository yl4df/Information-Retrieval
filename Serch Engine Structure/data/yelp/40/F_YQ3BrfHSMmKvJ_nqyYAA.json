But I love it so I'll do it anyway.This is my hands down favorite pizza in Seattle. Delancey's has an excellent chocolate chip cookie, very good Neapolitan style pizza and a lovely ambiance, but when it comes to the business of eating pizza (and only pizza) I come here. I come at judicious times because the waits are ridiculous, I order a buffalo mozzarella pizza, I eat the whole thing, and I leave.I can't order this pizza to go, while it is still good pizza, in the fifteen minutes it takes me to get it home it has already degraded into something that is less than what I know it can be.In conclusion, go, and go right when they open or tough it out and have a drink with your buddies at a nearby bar while you wait an hour and a half + for a table.", "Date": "2014-06-28", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Jason T.", "ReviewID": "j06VXnuWv3iR9tRhkZUYsw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I won't lie, I had not done my research and actually thought this restaurant sold PIES. It was slightly disappointing, but thin-crusted pizza isn't bad either! My party of seven split four pizzas (each able to feed one to two people). 1) The sweet fennel sausage was the best in my opinion and a must have, possibly because its large chunks of meat made it more desirable and delicious. 2) The arugula and soft egg pizza was good, though not worthy of much recognition. It's easy to imagine the flavors involved (bitter, salty), and though interesting and irresistible to some, was okay to me. 3) The clam pizza was most disappointing as I hardly saw any clams or tasted anything resembling seafood on the pizza. The restaurant's infamous pies may be worth a shot, but beware of long wait times and a selection that leaves slightly more to be desired.", "Date": "2014-07-11", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "John S.", "ReviewID": "WOnoqE2oZu73VolOjiGlGw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "2 months ago:\"Steve Gordon?\" I asked querulously. \u00a0\"Jeff Thompson?\" I guessed, now a little unsure. \u00a0\"Jon 'Bonez' Jones?\" I ventured a wild ass guess...\"Tom Douglas! \u00a0Tom Douglas!

They have community tables so be prepared to sit next to strangers.. We didn't mind it that much since their was a seat gap between each of us and the other party.. The other party was very loud. This place is definitely not a place where you can be on an intimate date.. Please keep that in mind:)My husband and I ordered the fennel sausage pizza w/ roasted red peppers and the Yukon gold potato w/ rosemary and Pecorino cheese. I have to say out of the two, my favorite was the fennel sausage. I just like to load a lot of chili flakes on my pizza which was very good w/ the fennel sausage. I felt that the Yukon gold pizza was missing something, like a meat.. Next time I would have liked to add prosciutto to it. The crust was out of this world! Thin and crunchy yet soft.. I can't really explain, but it is good! My hubby and I liked to dip our pizza in ranch. Unfortunately, they don't have that. Only a side of olive oil w/ your pizza. Which we politely declined:)My hubby had two beers I had a root beer float and took to the hotel a slice of their coconut creme pie.. The root bear float had only one small scoop of ice cream.. I would have liked more to be honest. The coconut cream pie was good. It came w/ 3 strawberries and lots of toasted coconut.. There was not much crust, which in my opinion offsets all the cream, but none the less still very tasty. Our total bill was about $65.

The Atmosphere: Given my description of my own palette, it should come as no small surprise that I offended the wait staff by ordering off menu. I asked for a pizza with sausage and pepperoni to share with my wife, who is equally picky. The resulting macro expression across her face was akin to what you might expect from one of Dr. House's patients who'd contracted terminal leprosy.

Not so salty that we would return them to the kitchen but, at about $16 per personal pie, they should really be consistently great, not just tolerable. To make matters worse, we were given someone else's lower bill, and when we tried to do the right thing, and correct the situation, we were kept waiting an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Our server didn't seem to \"get\" that we were doing the restaurant a favor, and took his time getting us the corrected bill. After discussing the food quality with my group later, I decided to call the manager and let her know, for the future, that the pies were overly salty. I figured it was a training issue, and could easily be corrected. However, I got the feeling that she didn't believe me, and wanted to know if I called to get a refund.

Serious Pie does a great version of a wood-fired pizza, though I interpreted them more as a great, gourmet flatbread.I've gone a few times and have had the:-marinated lacinato kale with calabrian chilis and pine nuts - smoky, slightly spicy and earthy - roasted seasonal mushrooms and truffle cheese pizza - a rich and luxurious, this is a mushroom lovers' delight-yukon gold potato, rosemary, and pecorino romano pizza - potatoes on pizza seriously works and I just love the addition of the nutty pecorino and earthy rosemary. - sweet fennel sausage, roasted peppers, provolone pizza - nothing too spectacular as far as pizza combinations goes but I will say the sausage is clutch (they cure their own meat in house!)

The apples in this dish was something special.- Soft eggs, smoked proscuitto, percorino sardo, arugula: so drool worthy! It was a thin crust pizza with layers of proscuitto (yum), a runny egg (double yum), and topped with a good amount of arugula.

No. While the pizza was the stone oven baked thin crust that I love, I did not think the pizza was spectacular enough for me to wait 1.5 hours in the cold for.

I had yukon gold potato, rosemary, pecorino romano pizza, roasted seasonal mushrooms, truffle cheese pizza, sweet fennel sausage, roasted peppers, provolone pizza, and penn cove clams, pancetta tesa, lemon thyme pizza.

On my most recent occasion, we were debating between the fennel sausage and the daily special (involving kalamata olives). The special was so salty we couldn't eat it; we informed the waitress and a fennel sausage pizza arrived at our table 10 minutes later.

The closest I can come up with is during my poor days in college, trying to make pizzas from the free pitas from Greek restaurant left overs, herbs and tomatoes from the garden and left over meats sent from my mom.

You're able to see the chefs in the back actually prepping the ingredients and cooking the pizzas, which is interesting since most kitchens are closed off from the actual eating area. It added to the intrigue of the restaurant. It's an excellent place to go to with a group, although I'd recommend making a reservation first. The service was good. Waitress didn't hang around our table too much, but she didn't disappear down some rabbit hole. Attentive, but not overbearing. It was a perfect medium. I ordered a pizza with golden chantarelle mushrooms and truffle cheese. I can't stop thinking about how delicious it was. The mushrooms retained all their delicious flavor and juciness, the cheese was perfectly melted and not oily or piled on too high. The crust was thin and crisp, which to me means that the ingredients used in making the whole pizza were fresh and high-quality. The edges are also salted, which I thought was interesting. I wish I knew how they made the crust though... flat and crisp on the outside, flaky and airy on the outside. It was just perfect. I also ordered a Brasilena, which I highly recommend to those who like coffee. It's a carbonated, sweetened coffee-type beverage made in Italy. It was refreshing (almost like a coke, without that sickeningly sweet taste) -- I wish I knew where else I could get my hands on it. \u00a0At around $20 per person, it's not the least expensive place to go, but i think it's well worth the price.

She was able to sit us pretty much immediately though which was nice. We ordered the Bruschetta with peach, the pizza with buffalo mozzarella, and the one with the mushrooms and truffle cheese. Everything was amazing! We were so glad we decided to eat here. I don't usually eat crust, but I was devouring the crust it was so good. The atmosphere was very relaxed, a good place to go for lunch. If you're not comfortable with sharing your space and table with other people, you may not like this place as the tables are communal.

Its was almost like naan, with a crispy exterior and almost void space in the middle.

The truffle cheese is very subtle and thus did not add much to the pizzaPenn Cove Clams - I love clam pies and this one was good. Like all the other pizzas here, the flavors were subtle but it works in this case because the creaminess is toned down and the added peppers adds a great kick to the end of each biteSoft Cooked Free Range Eggs - Breakfast pizza for the win. The only issue is that the one we got had very little kale, which is needed to contrast the egg and sausage in the pizza. The yoke is fantastic and just goes great with that fluffy crustIf I was grading on just the pizza, it would probably be 4 stars, but the service we had was a bit off and I was mildly disappointed by the beer selection.

I loved the candle lit tables with the dim lighting. The overall atmosphere of the place lured my friend and I to order a bottle of wine to start off our night. We ordered a bottle of Araldica Barbera D' Asti which we really enjoyed. The full bodied wine definitely warmed us up after a day of walking around the city in 30 degrees weather. I say a good start to the night! We ordered the salad special for the day which consisted of arugula, persimmons, and hazelnut with a citrusy dressing. The salad was good when you ate it with all the ingredients together, meaning the greens, persimmons, and hazelnut. However if your bite of the salad just consisted of the greens, it was quite sour and salty. I would have liked it if I enjoyed every bite of my salad. I would give it a 4/5. My friend and I shared the Mushroom and Truffle Cheese Pizza. From the moment our waitress brought out the pizza I knew we would enjoy it. There was a subtle sweet smell to the pizza that had us drooling. Once I took a bite of the pizza it felt like a little bit of heaven in my mouth. Wow everything on the pizza went well together, the mushrooms, cheese, and bread. The mushrooms were very flavorful but not overpowering. I didn't mind the fact that it was the only topping on the pizza. The cheese was sweet yet savory. It was pretty amazing. And the bread was chewy and crispy on the outside. Just the way I like it. It was definitely a 5/5 for me! We decided to order dessert since we still some wine left. We ordered the Chocolate Budino. It was a disappointment. I've had Budinos at several restaurants in LA and have enjoyed it every time. Maybe I had high expectations? The Budino at Serious Pie was like a thicker/creamier chocolate pudding. It was quite disappointing. A 2/5 from me. Overall Serious Pie was a positive experience.

We slid in right at or maybe a minute after happy hour, but the waitress said if we could throw together an order quick style she would honor the happy hour price! Awwww! The happy hour on pizzas is a great deal especially if you want to sample the menu at $6 for a half pie. The half pie is a largish portion for one. We ended up ordering the all but one pizza on the menu between the four of us. Every pie I have ever ordered here was amazing. Keep in mind I don't eat meat so the ones I have ordered are of the meatless variety, but that buffalo mozzarella is so good you could never miss the meat and if you do miss it I am sad for you. The carnivores at our table though were more than happy with their meaty selections. The prices are pretty reasonable running between $13-$20's a pie. The ingredients are all high quality so rest assured you get what you pay for. The interior is intimately lit and tables kinda squished in. When it is busy you might feel a bit cramped. It is also possible to be in close quarters with another group you may not know. This isn't bad when I have had it happen we all usually end up getting along smashingly. This place is in Belltown though so unless you want to pay for parking at the lot out back then you may be hard pressed for street parking.Overall Serious Pie is a must try.

Yes, this was definitely going to happen.The sweet fennel sausage did not disappoint; both the artisanship of the pie and the quality of the ingredients stood up to our high expectations.

Add in there the rosemary and it was overwhelming in a bad sort of way. well, not so bad that it wasn't taken back to the hotel room and demolished during some alcohol-fueled, late night eats.

You don't have a ton of control over where you get seated, and you could very well end up sharing a table with strangers, so not recommended for a first date or casual meeting (or maybe sitting with a bunch of strangers will push your date so far into awkward that it will come out the other side and actually be more comfortable).People tend to complain about two things with Serious Pie- the occasional charring on the crust, and the price. It's a Tom Douglas restaurant and you're getting a pretty big personal pizza. It runs in the $15-25 range, but I can't imagine expecting otherwise. If you're expecting Domino's, or even Pagliacci, you will be disappointed.

Except, apparently, me. I've been to a few and without exception I have left thinking, \"Yeah, that was pretty alright.\" Serious Pie continues the trend with their gourmet pizzas.Serious Pie serves gourmet, thin-crust pizzas cooked in a wood fire oven. The crust is thin and crispy but not cracker-y. The toppings are fresh and mostly unexpected, so if you're looking for typical sausage and pepperoni-type toppings you'll be out of luck (although they do offer a mighty fine sausage pizza). The menu is limited, but I have tried nearly every kind and they've all been tasty. The potato pizza seems to be a favorite among my coworkers, and I enjoyed the duck egg pizza. The buffalo cheese pizza is simple and yummy, and the onion/huckleberry pizza was an interesting taste adventure. They also offer a clam pizza, but I wasn't feeling daring enough to give it a shot. All in all, the pizza is good, but it never seems to \"hit the spot\" when I'm really in the mood for pizza.The appetizers are similarly unexpected: a meat plate and duck liver pate, just to name two. But none of the appetizers is very substantial. They do more to keep you occupied than begin the meal - but I suppose that may just be the point.The atmosphere is casual and rustic but sophisticated. As expected from a Tom Douglas spot, the servers know everything about the menu and are very attentive. The main dining room features long, tall tables shared by multiple parties, so get ready to sidle up next to a stranger while you enjoy your pizza. There is also a \"kitchen table\" for bigger parties, but you have to call ahead to reserve it. I've eaten in both areas, and they've both been just fine.Both of my visits have been for work parties, so I haven't paid a great deal of attention to prices.My general impression of Serious Pie is that it's a nice place to take out of town visitors or go on a date. It's got great atmosphere and sophistication. It's also tastier and less pretentious than Via Tribunali (they're not fooling anyone with all their pizza ingredients in Italian).

After all, his creations are not your standard grease soaked, government cheese topped, corner delivery joint \"pizzas\". No, my friends - these \"pies\" are serious - soft cooked duck egg and huckleberry serious. \u00a0Food: Serious Pie specializes in artisan wood-fired pizza. The pizzas are oval shaped (about 11\" by 7\") and serve 1-2 people. All the pizzas include an assortment of unique ingredients like yukon gold potatoes, truffle cheese, clams, huckleberries, and soft cooked duck eggs. Given that I was going to be boarding a plane within a few hours of my recent visit to Serious Pie, my dining partner and I opted for a seemingly less adventurous pizza topped with buffalo mozzarella, red sauce, and fresh basil. The pie was perfectly cooked, the ingredients were fresh and flavorful, and the crust was like no other that I have ever ingested. Service: Serious Pie does not take reservations, so you will undoubtedly have to wait for a table unless you arrive during non-peak dining hours. If there is a wait, they will take your name and number and call you when your table is ready. Fortunately, during our late Sunday morning visit, we were promptly greeted and seated by the hostess. Our waitress arrived shortly thereafter and was attentive throughout the meal - she was also more than willing to answer any questions about the menu offerings.Atmosphere: The atmosphere of Serious Pie was really the only lackluster component of the dining experience. The dining room is incredibly small, and thus, the seating is communal - although some might find this perfectly acceptable, I consider such arrangements more appropriate for cafeterias, prisons, and soup kitchens. The kitchen is also open, so you leave reeking like pizza. It's also important to note that the vast majority of the tables are also high tops, which can prove problematic for parties with children or elderly individuals. Cost: Expensive by casual pizza dining standards. Appetizers are $7-$14, pizzas are $15- $18, and desserts are $4-$8.Other: Hours of operation are 11AM-11PM daily. Serious Pie features a happy hour, Monday-Friday, 3PM-5PM, which includes select mini pies for $5 and a handful of wines and pints for $5 and $4, respectively. The restaurant also offers a special \"kitchen table\" menu, where you can reserve a table in the center of the kitchen for small parties (12 seated, 16 standing) - there is a $400 minimum for a two hours reservation or $700 for the entire evening.", "Date": "2012-09-30", "Author_Location": "Atlanta, GA"}, {"Author": "Laurence K.", "ReviewID": "u9NpRl-AJsK6fxvokx0Z0A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive eaten a lot of pizza in my 53 years being from Chicago and having some great pizza places I must say this was my favorite pizza ive ever had.

I didn't look at reviews, or knew about Tom Douglas or whatever; I just wandered in. I thought it was a bit pricy for pizza, but figured there wasn't much occasion to spend $20 on a pizza. Plus, with a place bustling with energy, I thought I couldn't go wrong.This is some serious damn-good pizza pie. Well-named restaurant, indeed.The savory flavor and slightly salty bread was just right. The blistered and nan-like bread of the pizza was a great base to the toppings. Be sure to check out the special of the day because it could vary based on season. My first experience was a seasonal squash pizza topped with whatever was so delicious. Red pepper at the side that I sprinkled to the way I like it. Overall good vibe. Go with good company and this would be the pizza place you won't forget. I went alone the first time, so I ended up with group seating with a stranger across from me. (Luckily, I ended up with a great conversation.) Pretty crowded seating. Expect to wait for minimum 20 minutes.Being a vegetarian, I think my default favorite is the mushroom truffle cheese pizza. I do recall a pretty good leek pizza as well. Other times, I've asked to customize the potato one not to include meat instead, but replace with mushroom. Definitely trying a variation off the main menu opens some options for a vegetarian after coming here every month. They were able to accommodate a slight customizing and still was balance. So good, I feel my mouth water right now.Since discovering this place, I would look forward to taking people to eat at Serious Pie. A must go place.

It was somewhat pricey, for not that exceptional pizza. However, I understand the pricing, due to the ingredients they use, compared to the franchise pizza chains. We ordered the Yukon gold potato, the mushroom and truffle cheese, and the sweet fennel sausage pizzas. The potato one was disappointing; it didn't have very much flavor (it was just crust, layered with potatoes, and seasoning/herbs --no sauce). Both the mushroom and sausage pizzas were a lot better. Two people in my group didn't like mushrooms, but one of them enjoyed the mushroom pizza nonetheless. So, for you mushroom-haters, it might just be a hit or miss (it has a pretty strong flavor of mushroom). The pizza crust is pretty thin, and couldn't really hold the weight of the sausage pizza's toppings.// It's just my personal preference of \"simple pizzas\" (i.e., Domino's, I really like their garlic seasoned crusts!) over the more gourmet-style types of pizzas, and so I don't think I would revisit and pay for this.

I finally made it. After a long time of hype and people talking this place up... I made it in. And it was even for kind of a serious meeting. Kind of. Anyway, all hype and non-seriousness aside, this was some pretty-good-but-not-mind-blowing pizza. I split a fennel-sausage and cherry-bomb pepper pizza and a pizza with soft eggs, bitter greens, and pork with my associate, and we started with a salad of foraged greens and _____ (we weren't sure). The salad was tasty in a better-than average way. The fennel sausage pizza was tasty, as was the other pie. The sausage stood out as a high quality version of the sausage I used to love on cheaper pizzeria pizzas. Both were \"good\" but not \"stellar.\" The one stand-out part of the equation was the crust. As my dining partner so aptly pointed out, it was crusty on the outside, soft on the inside, and had some quality \"depth\" to it. That all said, I guess I was expecting more. I'm not going to use the hype as an excuse to drop 3-stars on this place. The pizza is good. That said, I've been blown away by some perfectly chewy wood-fired crust in Portland lately, and add in some toppings with some slightly more exciting flavors and zing to the sauce, and I was just let wanting with this pizza. I was expecting serious flavors. Plus, our final $55 bill for 2 pizzas, a salad, a hot tea, and an Italian Soda with frozen prosecco was steep.

Anyway, I've been to a few places that claim to serve artisan pizza when in fact, they're just serving burnt flatbread with fancy toppings. Tom Douglas has figured out how to offer pizza that doesn't veer too far away from the norm and somehow turn it into some amazingly tasty creations. The secret is in the crust. I went to a Napa winery once where the guide described their special reserve Chardonnay with a straight face as \"butter-butter-crisp\". That exactly describes the crust here... butter-butter-crisp. Needless to say, this place is packed (see photos). It's a relatively small space made up mostly of community tables. Don't expect a lot of privacy, and be aware that there will be plenty of mutual gawking once everybody's pizza order shows up. Jamie and I decided to start with an appetizer to get our palates prepared. We ordered the $8 Asparagus with the 8-Minute Egg and Anchovies (see photo). Fresh with a snap, the nine spears had a crusty anchovy topping undercut by Parmesan shavings. Tasty but we were ready for the main attraction. Jamie ordered the $16 Cherry Bomb Peppers and Sweet Fennel Sausage Pizza (see photo). It was a deliciously carnivorous twist on a standard sausage pizza with bursts of flavor with every bite. I went for the comparatively smoother $16 Roasted Mushrooms and Truffle Cheese, which had barely a hint of truffles but certainly a bed of melted cheese (see photo). It was a gooey pleasure with the large mushrooms providing the right textural contrast. The applewood-burning ovens really make the difference here. We were initially hesitant to order our own oblong, eight-piece pizzas, but they were gone in short order. No doggie bags for us. I don't think Tom allows Diet Coke on the premises, so Jamie tried the $3 Mexican Coca-Cola - puckery sweet before lapsing into a diabetic coma. I went for the safer $3 Barnes & Watson Iced Tea, which thankfully came with free refills. The one drawback was the snooty hostess who promptly forgot who we were and was about to seat someone else who claimed to have my name. Shame on her indifference. The waitress, however, was sensational, very friendly and attentive every step of the way.FOOD - 5 stars...butter-butter-crisp flatbread with style and maximum flavor...pizza by any other nameAMBIANCE - 4 stars...heavy on the walnut wood and framed by modern wrought-iron faux-candle chandeliers, very homey actuallySERVICE - 4 stars...cheers for the waitress and small-mouth to the hostessTOTAL - 5 stars...it really comes down to that pizza with the butter-butter-crisp crust", "Date": "2010-06-01", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Hannah L.", "ReviewID": "-Ri5hHAxAn-hCS8Aa-b_HA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I feel like Serious Pie is one of those Seattle standards against which all other pizza is supposed to be judged and found lacking. But honestly, it's not the other pizza I find lacking after a visit here....Let me say this is not memorably bad pizza, and were it a bit less expensive they might get another star simply for creativity if nothing else. Clearly part of the price comes in the form of good-quality toppings like tasty tiny mushrooms or juicy multi-colored cherry tomatoes, and I don't mind paying $16 or $17 (or more) for a tasty pizza.But...it just wasn't. I like flatbread style pizzas, thin crispy wood-fired pizzas, Neapolitan-style pizzas with hints of toppings and wisps of sauce. Somehow Serious Pie managed to combine all of these features but do it poorly, so that a pizza came out with little flavor and texture other than the crust itself. Even the basil pesto, beautifully pooled atop the orange and red tomatoes, failed to show up on my tongue. All I could taste, for all my focusing, was a crisped crust.We got ours to go (20-minute wait as opposed to a 45-minute wait to be seated), so I can't comment much on the ambiance other than to say it's crowded, noisy, and so probably a good place to go if you don't want to talk to whomever you're with or if you like touching strangers. So if you want Tom Douglas, there are plenty of other options nearby.

If you're a Chicago pie type, turn around. Same if you prefer any Pizza Hut, Papa John's, or even Pagliacci. If, instead, you merely love the concept of pizza and aren't married to any one implementation then you should try Serious Pie for sure. Showing up at 7:30 on a Friday night with a friend and snagging a table within 10 minutes was an excellent start to the night. While the tables are communal you won't have to be chatting with your neighbors. The space is loud and you can be confident that whatever you're discussing probably won't be overheard. If you can't handle other people at your table, well, that's between your therapist and you.I ordered up the special of the night, a olive oil, olive, ricotta, feta, and spicy capacola pie ($14), and a half carafe of the house red ($10) to split. It probably took about 20 minutes for the food to arrive and was piping hot as it arrived. One pie is a large dinner for one person, but much too little for two. I was able to finish mine without pushing any limits so treat yourself and get a pie to yourself. Obviously the star of the show is the crisp 'n chewy wood fired crust and top-notch ingredients. Toppings are high-quality and pack a punch so they are used sparingly and effectively. No pound of cheese per slice here, a confusing concept in the Extra-Cheese American culture.So the food was wonderful, as was the ambiance. The space is small for the number of people and elegantly furnished. Dark wood and dim lights, oddly attractive artwork, and a flickering glow from the wood oven and candles combine to create a very warm and comforting atmosphere that is a very real asset to the whole experience, a sedate dinner to indulge all five senses.There's room in this world for both Serious Pie and your everyday Hot Mama's pizza. They play very different rolls and are only the same food in the same way as strip steak and hamburger. Neither is superior; each is entirely more enjoyable in their own context.

The nice thing is that you can leave them your cell phone number and go grab a drink elsewhere (or just wander around) while you wait.

Even though we didn't talk with the people next to us, I rather liked that we weren't all on our own little table islands.Then came the service. The impression I got was \"I am a professional\" instead of the oh-so-usual \"This is a job.\" I'm not sure what part of his demeanor said that to me, but I liked it!As for the actual meal...We started with the truffle fonduta and toasted apple sandwiches. Oh my GOD. I wasn't particularly excited about apple sandwiches when we ordered, but that bread was so light and soft and delicious and that truffle fonduta was so CREAMY and good! We had some of the dip left after the sandwiches were all gone, and the waiter suggested we keep it for the next dish. We ended up dipping our pizza crusts in it. YUM!Pizza-wise we decided on the one with yukon gold potato, rosemary, and olive oil. The rosemary was a bit too strong at times, but for the most part it was quite good.We finished with the \"chocolate budino, fig mezzaluna.\" It was delicious and I was a little sad when it was all gone.Final thoughts? Definitely on the pricey side, but I was *very* happy with my meal and it was even better than I expected it to be.Notes:+ They only had 2 beers on tap. An IPA and a lager. I can't recall their names, but I guessed that they are probably local (or at least small) breweries.+ They don't seat incomplete parties, but they did let me get my name on the list an hour before my friend arrived... and while I believe a couple people skipped ahead of us at the end, we were able to get a seat as soon as she arrived.", "Date": "2009-11-02", "Author_Location": "Kirkland, WA"}, {"Author": "Melissa F.", "ReviewID": "UgCB73hvm946IpUiwFuB4w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely worth the wait!!!1. tuscan kale starter - HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Kale is pretty bitter on its own, but somehow the super light dressing on this made it so freaking delicious. I love food that still tastes like the original. So instead of tasting like the dressing, the dressing brought out the flavor in the kale while neutralizing the bitter. Freaking AWESOME. 2. carnation sunchokes starter - You had me at sunchoke. It's so rare to find this in a store much less on a menu. Delicious. The texture of the sunchoke with the sweet onion was perfect.3. \u00a0buffalo mozzarella pizza - Delicious. Your basic pizza with tomato, basil, and mozzarella. I'd never had buffalo mozzarella, but it's now my favorite type. The flavors tasted very, for lack of better word, pure. This is how pizza should always taste.4. sweet fennel sausage pizza - It was definitely sweet, and the fennel was all over the damned thing. It was immensely tasty, but it's not one that I would order. My friend is a creature of habit and after taking the first two bites, he stated it was the best pizza he'd ever had and he'd never order anything else. After that, he promptly inhaled the entire pizza.5. penn cove clam pizza - Awesome. Clams on a pizza? I had to try this for myself. It worked, it absolutely worked. It was a little too cheesed and salty for my taste, but the corners of the pizza where all you could taste was the clam and the pancetta and crust... omfg delicious. I ate to the edges and I started just nibbling and savoring. Everything was DELICIOUS. Even the desserts. The cannoli and the sea salt chocolate pudding were amazing.We came in a group of 8 on a Saturday night and had to wait 2 hours. No problem. We parked it over at the Buenos Aires Grille and downed some drinks while we waited for the phone call. Service was top-notch and the server was a good sport.

Grilled the way it was, it was very reminiscent of pike mackerel in both appearance and flavor but we both enjoyed it very much, especially with the small salad it came with. I also ordered one of the house made Italian sodas and although for the life of me I cannot remember what flavor it was, I do remember that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Our pizzas came out next, piping hot and ready to be devoured. Both of them were quite good, the Marghertia pizza's San Marazano tomatoes had a great sweetness to it while the Penn Cove clams gave great briny flavor of the ocean accentuated by the smoky pancetta and delicate lemon thyme. The pizza was definitely commendable although nowhere near dethroning our favorite and top of the list pizza from Pizzeria Delfina in SF.We topped off the meal with the Chocolate Budino with Olive Oil and Sea Salt which was absolutely delicious. The Budino was smooth and creamy and the fruity oil and flaky salt crystals complemented the not too sweet dessert perfectly.We've only had pizza in Seattle at Serious Pie so there really isn't any point of comparison but we are definitely curious to see how it measures up to Delancey (which unfortunately we were unable to squeeze in on this visit) so next time we'll have to make sure to try both and see which pie deserves the title of 'Best Pizza in Seattle.'", "Date": "2010-07-15", "Author_Location": "Long Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Kat F.", "ReviewID": "GTPYxP5gF7SjoPwC_YXfXw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As ever, I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but I'd like to come back and give it another try so I'll go with 4...for now! \u00a0We came here for lunch on a very, very rainy Saturday. \u00a012:15 seemed to be the golden hour (quarter hour?) as we were seated immediately and at 12:30 got to watch the lunch rush line grow. \u00a0The atmosphere of the place is very warm and cozy and comfortable and from our table we could see into the kitchen and watch the staff making pies. \u00a0They don't have diet soda of any kind. \u00a0I don' t drink soda so I don't care, but my boyfriend was a little saddened as he wasn't in the mood for beer. \u00a0The woman sitting next to us tried to order diet soda as well and was also disappointed so I could see this being a potential problem for them in the future. \u00a0I was pretty excited to order the truffle pizza (grilled mushrooms, truffle oil and truffle cheese) and hesitated briefly when they told me the special (roasted garlic, arugula and roasted mushrooms) but decided to go with my first decision. \u00a0I enjoyed it a lot but got a little bored of it halfway through and kind of wished I had ordered something with leafy greens on it as the pizzas on the table next to mine looked so good! \u00a0The truffle pizza could definitely do with a little mixing up, in my opinion. \u00a0I was excited by the drinks menu: $5 glasses of house wine and while there are only 2 beers on draft, they're the Snoqualmie IPA and the Maritime lager - excellent choices if you ask me!

Serious Pie is just one tiny example of kick butt-ass growing eateries located in this eclectic neighborhood.We stopped in just after 7 and put our name down for a party of four. The hostess told us it would be at least an hour wait and suggested we leave our cell number and grab a seat at one of the many bars in the area. I had heard (and read) so much about Serious Pie that there would be no way that we would deny ourselves the chance of sampling some of the best pizza that Seattle has to offer. So we headed off to Dahila Lounge for a glass of wine and proceeded to wait anxiously for our pizza protest strike. As promised we got a call back from the people at SP and we headed up the street. We were seated at a nice table in the center of the restaurant. Our server came over and took drink drink orders and let the pizza celebration begin!The menu is daunting, so we decided to buy some time and split a couple of appetizers to share. Beets and and a cured meat plate with an aged parmesan were the perfect call. The beets were amazing and the cured meats were sensual. Seriously, cured meats are hot. The four of us finally decided on three pizzas. The pizzas are thin crust Italian style, so they only bake for around 10 minutes. But our server brought each out individually which made it nice to eat in courses. Our favorite pizza of the evening is no longer on the regular menu (goat cheese with caramelized onions) but I wonder if I went back if they could make it because that pizza was screaming delicious! We also got the buffalo mozzarella, red sauce, fresh basil (margherita) and the sweet fennel sausage, peppers, provolone. All three were amazing with the crust cooked to near perfection.Even though we were all stuffed, we did order up dessert as well. A chocolate with sea salt and a cheese course.

Nothing felt gimmicky, either. That's the mark of a good design: novel without gimmicks. Charming. It's a small restaurant, and I'm not sure how accessible it would be for people with mobility issues. (See below for more notes.) The staff and servers were on top of their game, delivering relaxed service that was really on-point. The only gaff was beer recommendations from our server. She didn't actually know what she was talking about, but I didn't realize she'd been faking it until the beer showed up. They were gracious enough to switch my beer (which was not an amber as promised but a stout) for an actual amber. Much better. I wish the server had pleaded ignorance at the get-go, however. My wife cheated a little bit and read some highlights before we sat down so she knew to order the pizza with the potatoes on it. I balked at potato pizza and regret it a bit. My pie was good but not as stunning as hers. (I still love you, honey! Please continue to use your Yelp app for good!) Were I a local, this place would be in my rotation. They do a good wood-fired pie, and the crust has an interesting wheaty tang to it. Lovely, just lovely.

It was also nice and thin, which for me is a must. Honestly it was so tasty that after I'd wolfed down the final bite, I found myself almost wishing for more. So why three stars you inquire? Well, as I implied above it isn't exactly \"pizza\". Sure, it's baked dough with tomato sauce, cheese, and other toppings but for my money this isn't truly pizza. The cheese was applied sparsely, as if some shortage plagued the dairy industry and it was now being rationed much like gas in the 70's. I get that a lot of more traditional style pizza places do this but if this place was aiming for the traditional route they wouldn't charge prices as high as they do. Also, the cheese had an odd artificial look to it that reminded me melted wax dribbled on top. My pie, which set me back $17, was undersized for the price, which kind of contradicts what pizza's supposed to be about. Despite my complaints pizza is really good. No, honestly!

Things I didn't like about my experience:1) our server didn't tell us about the coat rack in the back or the purse hooks under the bar table - these would have been helpful to clear up some space2) I mention space being important because there is a clear lack of it. With communal dining and sitting in the bar tables section, it's really hard to not be in someone's personal space. I felt bad that we trapped these two ladies against the wall and they had so much trouble getting out that we had to stand up to let them through. It felt like \u00a0cramped airline seating. 2) clam pizza had huge chunk of grit/sand as I had my first bite. I thought I might have chipped a tooth. I didn't touch that pizza again. 3) sausage pizza was super greasy oily which made great chapstick but I'm not sure that's what I needed4) mushroom truffle something pizza was good but completely dry compared to the greasy mess of the sausage pizza. Not exciting5) after the ladies we corned to the wall left, in came a family with a young kid.. His parents nagged him during the time we were there for playing his nintendo ds with the sound on, for talking too loud etc. Table manners is very important when you are at communal dining and yet it can be so restrictive sometimes. Poor kid. 6) finally when we finished our pizzas we expected our server to come back with suggestions for dessert. You know the usual line \"Did you save room for dessert?\" but no, he just came with the check instead. And I was hoping to try the panna cotta. I didn't have enough desire to order the dessert separately so I gave up. 7) I like to see some of my food. The restaurant was so dark an we weren't next to the windows so all of our pizzas looked yellow-brown with lumps under the candlelight. I wish I could see some color.. But maybe the pizzas aren't colorful anyway. I don't recommend this place for kids. I don't recommend this place for people who don't like listening to other people's conversation like moving into a good school district. Sorry, I just can't tune everything out. And I don't recommend this place for parties under 4. Either go with a group of 4 or 6 - this way you get some space and can become the majority if you are seated at the bar table and maybe you can squeeze other people to the wall. Muahahaha.

That's a nice option, but since none of us drink we elected to wait (standing) at Serious Pie.And wait we did. It was 45 minutes before we were seated - and then another 20 minutes after that until we got our first bite of any food (the rustic bread soup). When dining with friends, waits usually don't bother me because you can fill the time visiting - but the noise level on a busy Thursday night made this very difficult. I'm 48 and many of our friends are well into their 50's - the noise level in restaurants is increasingly becoming a barrier \u00a0- it's frustrating.That all aside, I still rated it 4 stars because the food was superb - really exceptional. Both the rustic bread soup and the foraged mushroom pizza with truffle cheese had a perfect balance of flavors and textures.

There's no place for a group of four to stand & talk while waiting for a table. \u00a0Seating is at tall tables arranged cafeteria-style - your table blends seamlessly with your neighbor's. \u00a0Some call it cozy; I found it cramped - especially since you have to walk single-file from tables to the restroom or the front. \u00a0Reading this menu is like trying to decode the one-line text messages of an ultra-hip but introverted 14 year-old. \u00a0More like an obscure ingredients list intended to stump even hard-core foodies. \u00a0For example, the Italian word for \"pork cheeks.\" \u00a0Really? \u00a0Save it for Alton Brown, why don't you? \u00a0Our server decoded ingredients, but then got snooty when I asked \u00a0whether \"soft egg\" meant runny whites. \u00a0\"That's the point\" she retorted brusquely. \u00a0Tom Douglas, you have at least one lousy server on your staff. \u00a0With ingredients like these, you folks had better learn to be gracious....There are only 7 pie choices. \u00a0I decided on the spek (cured pork like bacon) with carmelized onions and sheep's milk cheese (translation required). \u00a0Everyone at our table agreed it was the wrong choice. \u00a0Tasted like hell, and paper-thin shavings of meat meant I would be looking for a snack afterwards. \u00a0Others fared better - the sausage with red sauce and the chantarelle mushroom with truffle cheese. \u00a0On the plus side, I have to give credit for an excellent-tasty crust (even if it's not a pizza crust as we know it) and getting Coca-cola in a real Coke bottle.I wish I could say this place is worth the hype, and if you're into Tom Douglas' style maybe it is. \u00a0For me if this place had anyone else's name on the marquee it would be roundly condemned for the cramped seating, poor service and the ultra-lame, over-priced hoity-toity take on one of America's favorite down-home classics.", "Date": "2008-12-06", "Author_Location": "Bellevue, WA"}, {"Author": "Jessica K.", "ReviewID": "Mfy0aZEStJr55flrzdml4g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yep, I'm definitely a fan.

Walk on in after peeking into the warm restaurant with communal seating. I couldn't recommend walking in with a party larger than 6 since their largest table can only accommodate 6, maybe 7. And I hope you like sharing tables and getting really close to your neighbor 'cause they fill those seats up and get you real nice and cozy with your table mate.We came in one early dinner hour with a group of 6 and was greeted by a lovely man named Scot (with only one \"t\" I've noticed.) He put up with our loud belligerent group, gave us sound recommendations and even humored our really really drunk friend. Kudos to you Scot.We started with the roasted pumpkin with pesto sauce, toasted hazelnuts and shaved garlic. I'm not a pumpkin lover-in fact, I despise all things with pumpkin flavored anything thanks to my overzealous grandmother and her favorite motto, \"There's children out there who are hungry so eat up.\" The pumpkin pieces had a rich almost meaty texture to it that was nicely paired with the garlic and pesto. I almost didn't know it was pumpkin 'cause it blew away all the other 20 recipes grandma tested on me.For dinner we had the cherry bomb tomatoes and sausage pizza, the salumi and walla walla onion pizza, and the buffalo mozzarella pizza. We originally ordered 2 sausage pizzas and one salumi pizza but we weren't going to hold it against him for giving us the wrong one 'cause it was good anyhow. You've got to try it for the olive oil crusts, the bubbly and crispy bites you take with wonderful aromas of fresh herbs \u00a0that hit you all at once. If you're a fan of New York style pizza or Chicago deep dish, don't come expecting anything close to it. This is it's own style and deserves to not be compared to anything else. I'd also recommend trying their spice cake with maybe a cup of coffee, especially since it's the fall and hell, olive oil is good for you too.

It only took 4 years, but I finally made it to one of only two Tom Douglas restaurants I haven't been to.Fortunately the crowds were minimal when 3 friends and I went on a Tuesday night. We were quickly seated and given menus to browse. I already knew I wanted the duck egg, garlic, spicy coppa, and arugula pizza. The Penn Cove Mussel pizza was a close second. My pizza was absolutely flawless. The crust was thin and crisp, the spicy coppa was so incredibly rich and flavorful and I loved how thinly it was sliced. The arugula added a spicy bite and the cheese was abundant enough to please a cheese lover but wasn't excessive or stringy. The duck eggs were perfect... slightly runny, rich, and decadent. This was unlike any pizza I've ever had but it was absolutely amazing. The people I was with ordered more simple pizzas. The fennel sausage was pleasant. Full of flavor and the fennel in the sausage complimented the peppers and provolone cheese quite nicely. Even the most simple mozzarella and basil was nice. However, I've found good pizza at plenty of places. If you're coming to Serious Pie why not order a pizza with duck egg or mussels? Be adventurous!Service was exceptionally attentive and friendly. Our server was so on top of it and had no issues accommodating us, splitting checks, etc. While they don't have the biggest wine/beer selection, it is a nice selection with some great choices. Serious Pie gets 5 stars... barely. I can't possibly describe how much I enjoyed the duck egg, garlic, spicy coppa, and arugula pizza. It was flawless.

Even padded fabric panels with some sort of front design that went half way down the bakery windows might help to absorb some of the sound with out ruining the view and feeling of space.We ordered the Wild Mushroom with Truffle Cheese (the best I thought), the classic Margarita and the Potato pizza. All were good but none of them were great. The mushroom was satisfying for a few of us but fell short for the rest, the Margarita was okay, but not done in the classic style and with a little too little ingredients and the Potato was way more potato than pizza and nearly sent me into a carb induced coma.

My friend and I came during happy hour, so we didn't have to wait for a table at all :) The ambiance is really chill and there are tons of windows, as well as high tables with comfy chairs... so it's an ideal spot for people watching if you're into that sort of thing.Because it was HH (from 3-5pm every weekday), half pizzas were only $6, plus they had some other really great appetizer specials, as well as drink specials! I ordered two pizzas for myself and fell in love with both of them!!! The chanterelle mushrooms and truffle cheese pizza was pretty outstanding, especially because they also lightly dusted the crust with some garlic... but I thought the chunks of mushroom were a little too big for my liking. It was still friggin' amazing, though - they seriously have THE best pizza crust I've ever tasted. It's so light, flaky, airy, and crispy...ahhhhhhmaaaazing! But the pizza that I still can't get out of my mind is undoubtedly the sweet fennel sausage with roasted red peppers.. oh my goodness. All of the flavors just blended perfectly together! The chunks of ground sausage were really fresh and the fennel added a nice kick. I added some extra crushed chili pepper flakes, which really made the pizza kickin' with spice! I wish we had a pizza like this in LA, but I have yet to find one that matches up.We also got a chance to try one of their appetizers, which was decent...but nowhere near as stellar as the pizza. We ordered buttery crostini, which came with a sweet apricot jam, as well as some cured salami. It was pretty decent and a unique take on crostini, but nothing special. They also had a special on a non-alcoholic drink of the day, which turned out to be a watermelon soda. It was really fresh and came served in a mason jar, which was an amazing steal for just $2.50! They also had a root beer float shooter on the menu for HH, but unfortunately I didn't have room left for that... despite the fact that I pretty much have a bottomless stomach.

And I must admit, I was a bit skeptical of haute cuisine in regards to pizza. I am not a huge pizza fan, I admit - my first real job (I'm snorting as I type \"real\") was at Little Caesar's, and believe me, it was the longest 7 months of my life, and I probably ate my weight in pizza. Due to that, I really feel like I'm done.Serious Pie was pretty good, Crow & I got in early (like 5:15 early) on a Wednesday night, so we had our choice of seats - I'd recommend the two top back corner barstools and tables, a little quieter. Nice ambiance, a pretty small, low-lit, warm place. I was starving and Crow was only mildly hungry, so we originally opted to share a pizza and split a starter, but we were discouraged from that by our server, and not knowing how big the pizzas are, we took the advice and ordered our own pies - mozzarella di buffala and tomato for me, and some sausage creation for him (again with the meat), and a large beet salad to share.I'm not all that into beets, but this salad - amazing!! It was made with both classic red & golden beets (I prefer the golden, they're a little more on the mellow side), but what really made this a phenomenal salad was the mint. I know, mint and beets, sounds weird and maybe a little gross, but it was fantastic! After the out of this world salad, the pizza fell a little flat. For starters, the suggestion that we each order our own because one wouldn't be enough to share was not true, we each left with half a pizza. Crow was pretty happy with his meaty delight, and mine was a pretty typical cheese pizza, not bad but nothing too exciting. All in all, a good meal, good ambiance, AMAZING salad, and a bill a little bigger that I'd like to pay for two small pizzas and a salad. Will I go back? Maybe for the salad.

She didn't try to upsell us, which I appreciated, and always tend to order more that way.Another plus for happy hour prices. $6 for a mini pie = phenomenal. If you're hungry, you can likely get full off of 2 mini pizzas, easily. Atmosphere - pretty cool. Had never sat at a communal table before like these. 6 people tables...when we came, we sat with two other groups. Mildly awkward, especially since the people next to us were particularly douchy, but it's not really a place where you linger for hours so it was all good.Parking...there's a sketchy lot nearby. We paid $7 to park but if you're lucky, you might find street parking. Now for the food...I admire the innovation and creativity that went into these pizzas but I was disappointed. They all sounded phenomenal - and were clearly better than Domino's/Papa John's/etc. but was still lacking. I had the Yukon/Rosemary pizza and the fennel sausage. My husband had the Yukon & Mozzarella/San Marzano tomato pizza. Verdict? Liked the mozzarella/San Marzano the best. Then the fennel. Then the Yukon. The crust on all three was too burnt for my liking. The Yukon had too much rosemary (maybe I just don't like it?) and the sausage on the fennel pizza was awesome but that was probably the most redeeming part. A little disappointed, we tried the desserts which were, in my opinion, much better. Chocolate bodino (which is a chocolate pudding with salted caramel) was incredible! Cannolis...meh. I don't like cannolis with a lot of fruit and these tasted like they had too much orange. For 4 mini pies and 2 desserts, it came to about $44.

(the \"Roasted chaunterelles, truffle cheese pizza\" to be exact) Its a different kind of pizza: the crust was fluffy and thin, chewy and just the right amount of saltiness, the cheese almost melting right into it.

Guilt didn't prevent us from getting our eat on, however, after all, we're on vacation! So we ordered a couple of beers and two pies (all are created to be individual sized, but can 1 satisfy 2 people if you aren't starving): mushroom & truffle and sausage & pepper pizza. Both were really tasty, but the sausage & pepper was one of the best combinations I've ever had. Sausage wasn't the crappy, dry little nuggets you get on most chain pizzas, it was REAL sausage, and the peppers were just the right heat for the pie. Tomato sauce was fresh and tasty, and the most unique thing about Serious Pie is the light, airiness of the crust - it's literally like eating slightly crispy pita pizza, but more airy.

In various fields, there is a certain point where things get so good that any change is probably a step backwards. For example, Mozart wrote some of the best music in history. When the modernists came around and wrote atonal music, they were trying to make progress, but by most accounts it sounded worse. I think Serious Pie represents a similar step backwards, but it is priced outrageously and packaged with its little running cartoon character emblem as if it is striving for something worthwhile.

When we finally did. it was a bit of a surprise it would be a community type table (we were to share with another party of 3).

We went with the waitresses suggestion of getting the day's special pizza, a venison pizza, along with their sweet fennel sausage pizza. I have to say I was really surprised to like the venison pizza since it also used goat cheese. I was worried it'd be a little on the game side but it was amazingly good. I really wished I wasn't too full to eat the last slice, but alas, I had to sacrifice for the sake of shopping some more. The sausage pizza was also good. It had a nice rich tomato sauce. It also wasn't too heavy and the crust had a nice bite to it.So what happened to them girls that were terrible and turned out to be drunk? Well they were so terrible the wait staff was annoyed and they sat there for an extra hour after they were done with their meal and had the bill. I get that you can linger, but when it's super busy it's kind of an asshole move. That and when they left, there was barely any tip (overheard a server cleaning the table). The pretty nifty part was that they ended up feeling bad for us, you know, for sitting next to those idiots that they gave us a complimentary dessert. Now it's no secret that I don't really care for chocolate, but the chocolate budino was pretty good. It comes served in a little bowl class with sea salt and olive oil.

It still offers enough privacy. It seats 6, one couple on each end. We started with a carafe of their house Chianti (ONLY $15)!!! For starters we went with the burrata and the bruschetta. The burrata consisted of peaches with a light Italian cheese, and pine nuts. Sounds odd, and it kind of was, but it was soooo good. The bruschetta, which was off the menu the 2nd time we went, had chopped up summer squash and just oozed with flavor. Now to the important stuff - the pizza. We had one of their specialty of the week pizzas and two that are on the menu everyday. The specialty was the pork belly pizza. Great flavor, but a bit buttery. The two stars were the mushroom truffle pizza and the cherry-bomb peppers & sausage. The truffle and mushrooms created an amazing combination, almost too rich. The sausage and sweet peppers worked magic in my mouth - great combination. Service was solid. It tends to get pretty busy during the week, so go early for lunch.

We arrived around 6pm on the Sunday night of Labor Day weekend, and couldn't get seated until around 8:30pm. \u00a0If I lived in the area, I would recommend ordering these pies to go all the time to avoid the wait, but if you have to wait, it's absolutely worth it as well.What we ordered:1) Starter: peaches, burrata \u00a0(fresh Italian cheese, made from mozzarella and cream. The outer shell is solid mozzarella while the inside contains both mozzarella and cream, giving it an unusual, soft texture. It is usually served fresh, at room temperature. The name \"burrata\" means \"buttered\" in Italian.), pine nuts: Okay, peaches, check, the perfect summer fruit, burrata - a cheese that means butter - must try, check, pine nuts, always a check. \u00a0All three together, mmmm, you get the juicy sweetness from the peaches elevated by the light, butteriness of the burrata, and tinge of pine nuttiness. \u00a0Delicious morsels kept disappearing off the plate until we were left staring at an empty plate, willing for more to appear.2) Pizza: chanterelle mushrooms, truffle cheese: Yes, you read that right, TRUFFLE CHEESE. \u00a0You could put just about anything with that, and it would be a happy party in my mouth, but instead, there's my favorite mushroom ever with it - chanterelle, joy! \u00a0Each bite of this airy pizza dough, with its substantial, chewy texture, made me wish I could eat this everyday. \u00a0My umami-radar was definitely off the charts with the lovely flavor that is universally yummy.3) Pizza: guanciale \u00a0(unsmoked Italian bacon prepared with pig's jowl or cheeks. \u00a0Pork cheek is rubbed with salt, ground black pepper or red pepper and cured for three weeks. Its flavor is stronger than other pork products, such as pancetta, and its texture is more delicate.), soft egg, beacon hill arugula: The slight bitterness from the arugula combined with the savory saltiness of the guanciale was gently enveloped by the comforting, soft egg on this tasty slice. \u00a0At first you taste a very deliciously balanced \u00a0pizza, and then, with the next slice, you get a sense of the flavor somehow maturing, morphing, into more than what you first encountered. \u00a0It was ridiculous how this pizza actually tasted better with each new slice as it revealed new insinuations of flavor like a rose, slowly blooming in the sun. \u00a0This is a serious pie folks. \u00a0We're not in Kansas anymore.4) Sweets: vanilla panna cotta, peaches, raspberries, pistachio: I've had several panna cottas in my past, and they generally taste like a less-sweet flan. \u00a0However, this one was like, a perfectly room-tempured kind of cheese, that easily came into my spoon, and into my mouth. \u00a0The pairings of the fruit and nuts were like fireworks on a summer night, but the panna cotta stole the show like an array of bright stars in the countryside.We all left this dinner with a sense of wonderment at the amazingness we just all experienced together, and vowed to return whenever we got a chance. \u00a0Serious Pie doesn't just serve the BEST pizza I've ever had, but a level of food that's on par with 3-star Michelin-rated restaurants in California.", "Date": "2010-09-12", "Author_Location": "Dublin, CA"}, {"Author": "Monica N.", "ReviewID": "-1oAA5b_1qpakrAUQ4pA1Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am definitely a TD fan, not because of the hype, but because the food I have tried at each one of his restaurants has always been great and the dishes I have tried really inspire me. \u00a0In Seattle, these $15-$17 personal pizzas blow me away!

Well ok, maybe not god, but in these \"budget concious and can't afford foie gras\" times I've made it my mission this summer to find the best pizza in town. Some of the criteria I've set forth are crust, originality, toppings, presentation...ahhh who am I kidding, I just want a bitchin' pizza!Serious Pie was a running start on the summer pizza quest for excellence. For me it was the perfect balance between a neopoitanesque pizza and gourmet modern day pies. To start with, I love the setup at this restaurant. Walking in and seeing the giant wood ovens, the meat curing shacks, and getting slapped in the face with that freshly risen dough smell just exponentially increases any appetite you will already have when you walk in. They feature a very concise and well executed menu and to help the repeat crowd they run multiple specials every day.First Course: Salt-Cured Ox tongueThere are times that being a cook and going to a restaurant has serious disadvantages. When you ask? Well, when you taste something so excellent that you are filled with jealousy from the first bite. I was a bit leery of trying the tongue at first, but my friend went ahead and ordered it anyways (i'll have to remember to thank him next time I see him). The tongue was flavored and cured perfectly, giving the salt-cured taste you'd expect from such an item but walking the line perfectly as to preserve the natural flavors of the Ox tongue. The green garlic and capers added just enough acidity to complete the whole picture and get our pallets warmed up for the next course.The Pies!Cherry Bomb Peppers and Fennel Sausage:In the nicest way possible, this is the best \"Tony's supereme\" pizza I've ever had. You know the one I'm talking about. The pizza that was SUPPOSED to be pepperoni but you were too inebriated at the grocery store at 2am so you bought the sausage and peppers pie instead...yeah that one. So now imagine, you are sober, and the pizza you are eating has house-made fennel sausage that is bursting with \u00a0flavor and freshness...feeling it yet? Now imagine that instead of those little machine cut frozen bell peppers, you've got fresh cherry bomb peppers with enough zest and flavor to get that mouth popping. Top it off with some cheese and you've got a safe but delicious pizza.Morel Mushroom, arugula pesto and parmesan:Fine...you win! What a fortunate time to make it in to Serious Pie. Utilizing morels on a pizza is quite an amazing thing and here it was executed perfectly. The arugula pesto was sweet with a little bite on it to really bring out the earthiness of the mushrooms. If you haven't had morels, let alone this pizza; get your butt down there and get it while the mushrooms are still in season. The pie is finished with grated parmesan cheese so the focus remains on the pesto and mushrooms but gives that little extra love that only parmesan can give.Great pies with, prices a little high for the size but still a good value , great ingredients, if nothing else get down there for the Ox tongue!", "Date": "2010-06-16", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Nhoj K.", "ReviewID": "gsQNAHKAHtHUB83q3XOdXw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Disappointing, after all the great reviews and the kudos this place got on the TV show; \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\".

a fitting choice not only because the 3:00pm start would allow my sister and I a taste of the highly acclaimed pizza while affording us plenty of time to digest before the night's dinner at The Herbfarm but also because my mother and aunt could thereby get a good meal at a great price since they'd not be joining us for the night's extravagance.Having heard that the space fills up quickly, especially for the discounted drinks and $6 personal pizzas our original goal was to arrive at Serious Pie as the Happy Hour began but unfortunately our amusement with the Fremont Troll and Archie McPhee plus a patch of bad traffic would delay our arrival till nearly 3:45, a time by which the restaurant was already full with a reported 45 minute wait during which my sister and I took a walk only to receive a text 20 minutes later that a communal 8-top was ready and that my mother and aunt were already seated (with particularly notable fantastic customer service assisting my aunt and her damaged Achilles' tendon through the crowded and tightly packed space.)Having already noted the bustling nature of Serious Pie it would be mere moments before a young lady named Leyla would greet us and dropping off menus she stated she would \"be right back\" with water - a process that took perhaps ten minutes as it seemed she was the only server working our half of the room and when she returned we not only received our water but placed our orders as well - three happy hour pizzas, an impressively potent house aged root beer, and a diet coke, all of which would arrive less than fifteen minutes later as the restaurant became louder and even more crowded largely due to a particularly sizeable group near the bar.With the pizzas arriving hot and bubbling from the large wood-fired oven, an oven that on my observation appeared to be able to turn out at least 6 pizzas at once, we were all quite amused by the small size and oblong shapes of the pies as each one was cut into 6 two-bite pieces with the puffy golden crust making up the better part of one of those bites, especially on the four \"corner\" pieces. \u00a0Served on black slates big enough to hold one or two pies it would not take long before we decided to dig in and beginning first with the aforementioned crust I must say it was not precisely what I expected but quite good none the less with a slightly blistered underside giving rise to a dense and bready interior with a touch of sweetness and good chew without being \"tough\" - a bit like 'pan'-pizza from a national chain, but ever more pleasant and less dense to be sure.Moving on to a discussion of the toppings our three pies would include \"Buffalo Mozzarella, Tomato Sauce, Fresh Basil,\" \"Soft egg, House made guanciale, arugula,\" and \"Yukon gold potato, rosemary, pecorino\" - all three featuring top notch ingredients in ample portions with the Margherita tangy and well seasoned, the egg a nice volley of creamy, savory, and bitter, and the potato and rosemary option a personal favorite largely because of the manner in which the lightly boiled potatoes provided just enough resistance to the tooth to be noticeable but otherwise served to lend their characteristic earthy body to the butter, hefty sprinkling of rosemary, and briny cheese.Moving next to dessert but knowing the night was far from over for two of us we settled on one selection, my choice of the \"Chocolate budino, sea salt, biscotti\" - a dense chocolate pudding with a texture more smooth than mousse but less dense than panna cotta bespeckled with crunchy rocks of sea salt and a light lacquer of olive oil that added a fruity top note. \u00a0Allotted only a couple bites each given the four spoons and rather small size I will say the thought crossed my mind to order another but deciding to show just a bit of restraint I instead took to using the warm and crunchy chocolate chip biscotti to wipe the jar clean while looking forward not only to our meal at The Herbfarm later than night but also another visit to a Tom Douglas spot the following day.", "Date": "2012-01-15", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Ariel Z.", "ReviewID": "ztjM-l90jUAHU6donAhAng", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The pizza is good, there's no doubt about that.

It easily serves four people if you're not going to chug it. As an accompaniment to dinner, it's wonderful.

The owners, the chefs, take their pie VERY seriously. And their salads. And their desserts. All were outstanding. Serious Pie dished up the best food we had during our recent holiday in Seattle. Indeed, the food was some of the best we have ever had in a restaurant anywhere, and we've eaten in many restaurants, many places. Granted, prices are high for a pizza parlor but, in terms of the quality of the food, Serious Pie is a great value.Why not five stars? Well, there's more to a restaurant than food. Atmosphere can make or break an otherwise perfect meal. In addition, a pizza parlor, however serious, should stock at least as much beer as wine. That's the American Way. Serious Pie is already breaking one tradition by serving great food in a pizza parlor. For my taste, it should limit itself to one tradition at a time. It's wine selection would do justice to a fine restaurant anywhere. But the beer -- well, as I recall, there were five beers on the list, all pale, and at least one of them was the popular Bumilco Sparkling Water. Curiously, there was nothing of similar quality on the wine list. Night Train Express, for example. One of the beers was good but it wasn't the black beer that this customer would have preferred.We went for a late lunch, about mid-afternoon. Shortly after we were seated, someone turned on the \"music.\" It seems there are only four kinds of vocalists left in America: screamers, whiners, screamer/whiners and the dweebs who do not even pretend to sing but just run their face in time to a beat. We were treated to a screamer. LOUDLY! We got up to leave and I politely explained to our waiter, in my usual soft, reasonable tone of voice, that we were not going to listen to that shit while eating. He turned the volume down. Not an ideal or customer-oriented solution but a compromise more-or-less acceptable to digestion.We went a second time for dinner. This time, there was no \"music.\" Different staff? Whatever the reason, the lack of \"music\" was inviting. Unfortunately, we were not the only people in Seattle who could taste the difference between a doughnut and a bagel. The restaurant was jammed; the wait was half an hour and, once in, we would have to sit in a pizza parlor environment, at a long table, elbow-to-elbow with the other hungry patrons.Since Serious Pie obviously did not need our wishes for all the patrons it could handle (it's best patronized during off peak hours) we instead wished it a better selection of beers, and left.", "Date": "2009-07-22", "Author_Location": "Salem, OR"}, {"Author": "Kim P.", "ReviewID": "LmQtJfmVWvxCkNcKFJ-PMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This place has been on my list to try since it opened.

Serious Pie. Let me just start off by saying that I don't usually rave about pizza, mostly because I unfortunately haven't had pizza worth raving about. Pizza is something that I don't ever crave whenever I'm hungry and I want food. Until I had the chanterelle mushroom and truffle cheese pizza at Serious Pie. Like Usher says, OMG. First of all, I've known about Serious Pie since it first opened and for some reason had waited a few months before going there, so my review is way overdue (yes, I can't believe I'm only writing this now, bad Farah). As the other reviewers said, pizza here is deeelicious, regardless whether or not you wanna argue that the \"pizzas\" are more like flatbreads than pizzas since they lack the circular shape. Whatever, moot point, good food is good food regardless of name and shape. The aforementioned chanterelle mushroom and truffle cheese pizza is definitely my favorite. I love chaterelles, I love truffle, I love cheese, ergo I love this pizza. It's my go to pizza. BUT I've also had the rosemary potato pizza and it's a super close 2nd favorite, losing by a teeeny tiny bit. It blows my mind to have potatoes on a pizza, and yet it works. That's carb heaven right there. I've also had their beef carpaccio, which was tender and flavorful. Whatever olive oil they used in that appetizer, it was yummy.So after all the kudos, why the 4 stars. Well, seating.

The pros did not outweigh the cons, nor did the cons sink this ship. The result is a mediocre review.We went here for a group event. One of the perks of this is that they had stations in the \"Workshop\" where they let us make cheese, canoles and breadsticks. That's pretty cool, and it was a good time even though the filling for the canoles was a little too mascarpone-y. The other perk? I didn't have to pay. If I did have to pay I would have been disappointed. Here's why: 1. The pizza is good in a we're-creative-with-our-pizza kind of way. There is a pizza with potato on it, think potatoes au gratin on crust, which is a carb double whammy. Tasty, but where's the meat or any kind of veg? Other than creativity the crust is the most delicious part. Even if you hate crust, you'll like this crust. The mushroom pizza tasted a little dirty, possibly due to an overabundance of truffle oil. I wouldn't want to pay that much for that pizza.2. The staff seemed confused and not very friendly (read: annoyed by our presence).

If you are a fan of the wood-fired, thin crust type of pizza, you must try this place.There are a few things you need to consider though before you go or else you will be disappointed. 1) The pizzas are small. One pizza can feed 2, but for hungry people, it may only feed one. So be prepared to buy a few pizzas when you are there. Given that it's around $12-$17 per pizza, it may be a shock if you are not forewarned. 2) The wait during prime lunch and dinner hours can be fairly long. It's not a big place, so the area in the front is jammed packed. Some people put their names in and go to Dahlia Lounge (conveniently a Tom Douglas restaurant as well) or across the street for a few drinks.

The food and the setting are not intended to be family friendly. \u00a0This is a good stop, and Tom Douglas is a Seattle standard, and something to sample while in town, but this is not a place to sit and stay and hangout. \u00a0The high bar stool seating doesn't really encourage lingering, and we felt like we were almost standing while eating, bumping elbows with others.While I love the idea of communal seating (some of my favorite spots in San Francisco and Portland have comfy, friendly communal seating) unfortunately the dining room at Serious Pie is crowded, noisy and even makes an extrovert like me feel a little claustrophobic. \u00a0The food is enjoyable though, so maybe a different setting and feel to the place, would encourage more return trips.The food is tasty. \u00a0The roasted king trumpet mushrooms and truffle cheese is one of my favorites, very subtle, and who can say no to braised pork belly and arugula salad as a starter? \u00a0Certainly not me. \u00a0 While we had a good experience, my best test of a place is how often I want to return. \u00a0We haven't been back in over two years. \u00a0its not the food, which is tasty, but it doesn't occur to us. \u00a0The ambiance isn't great, parking downtown in this area is a task, and due to long waits, a no reservations policy, and so many other great spots in town for date night, we save pizza for other family friendly spots (Delancey, Bar del Corso.)", "Date": "2012-08-07", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Hilary P.", "ReviewID": "MkH6XND4JrtfXAIL-xgaqw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We went on a Friday night at around 6:30pm, but it was a 1 1/2-2 hr wait so we came the next day for lunch around when it opened at 11am- no wait at all!Our server had a little bit of an attitude, but the food was effin delicious! The baby mixed greens was nothing special, but they really know how to make a \"serious\" pizza. The truffle cheese pizza was the TRUTH.

Serious Pie is aptly named. You can almost taste the dedication in their work, bubbling with pride and topped with fiery passion.Let me begin by saying I'm not a fan of the communal table Serious Pie has set up. My expectation to have an intimate date with my girlfriend was diminished as I felt uncomfortable sitting within whispering distance of the person next to me. It literally gets elbow-to-elbow when it's crowded in here. I know that's how it's supposed to be, but please take note if you're socially inept or have bad body odor or something.Anyway, being from Southern California, we were here for one night and one night only, so we were naturally very careful about what to order. The lady who seated us suggested a few menu items:- The sweet fennel sausage, pepper, and provolone pizza is most popular with customers.- The arugula, coppa, and soft-boiled egg pizza is her personal favorite.- The chanterelle mushroom and truffle cheese pizza is the one famously featured on Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\"We decided to go for that last one.As it turns out, the thing we ordered wasn't a pizza. Couldn't have been. A pizza is a hot, sloppy hunk of carbs and grease. No, what we received was a work of art. The crust was crisp with subtle charring around the edges, and the truffle oil blended in perfectly with the mushrooms and cheese. It wasn't overpowering as truffle oil can sometimes be, but just enough to bring out the other ingredients' earthy notes.My girlfriend and I devoured the entire thing, somewhat regretting that we had decided to share only one pizza instead of trying two. Alas, hedonism has its price. At around $20 a pie, it becomes somewhat of a budget issue that makes it difficult to justify ordering more. Serious Pie does have a happy hour in which several mini-pies are available for a few bucks, so if you and your party are interested in sampling a greater variety of choices, that may be the perfect time to stop by.", "Date": "2012-01-30", "Author_Location": "Monterey Park, CA"}, {"Author": "Ndub C.", "ReviewID": "SmZ1oq2HH975P0N3LTWd0w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW!

It was light, crisp, airy, and once again FLUFFY! For you salt lovers there is a slight saltiness that you would appreciate. It had a non-salt lover impressed with every \"other\" bite.

In fact, this pizza just tasted spicy and not much else. \u00a0We also ordered this special containing oregano, garlic, and truffle oil. \u00a0This one was our least favorite as it didn't have as much flavor or interesting textures as the other ones.The most amazing part of the pizza is definitely the crust! \u00a0I don't think I enjoyed the toppings as much as I thought I would but the crust was amazing. \u00a0It was crispy on the outside but still delightfully fluffy on the inside. \u00a0Any topping on that crust would probably be delicious! \u00a0It wasn't the best pizza (although still really good) \u00a0I've ever had but it was definitely very interesting.", "Date": "2012-07-04", "Author_Location": "Pasadena, CA"}, {"Author": "Kelly H.", "ReviewID": "KBYQgqQgzLjA2VVWAM4AxQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best pizza I've ever had in my life.

But I honestly don't think you need it. Ahh~ It was so amazing, I came here a 2nd time during my weekend trip and was EXTREMELY tempted to order to-go to bring with me on the plane.This is seriously some amazingly delicious artisan pizza, people!The first time we went, we had the plate of house cured meats with olives and roasted lobster mushrooms and truffle cheese pizza. HO MY GOD. That truffle cheese pizza is to die for. No lies. I'm salivating as I'm writing this. I must admit, for some reason I thought there was going to be lobster on this pizza (hadn't heard of lobster mushroom before) but no worries, it is deliciously scrumptious as is. The cheese is melted to perfection and you can just smell and taste the aromatic truffle... I would inhale that pizza to oblivion given the opportunity. I absolutely loved the texture of the lobster mushrooms! I've never had it before but it reminded me very much of oyster mushrooms (not the soggy ones but the firm ones). Every bite was so nice. Perfect separation of pizza into mouth!The house of cured meats was a bit random to me. There's the cured meat on the side (with chunks of peppercorn), a good serving of chicken pate (was it?) topped with capers (my fav!), slices of crispy buttery bread on the side, container of two different olives, and.. I can't remember if there was another part right now. The chicken pate was probably my favorite. I ended up dipping my pizza crust into that to finish it off, hah.The 2nd time we came to Serious Pie, we had the roasted garlic and braised pork belly, peach mostarda, arugula, and pistachios appetizer and the soft cooked duck eggs, garlic, coppa, and braised chard pizza. Oh ho ho ho. That braised pork belly.... devoured in NO TIME. It's a small serving of three pieces of oh gosh, it's really good. The peach mostarda was a really nice touch. Please get this if you like pork belly. :) The soft cooked duck eggs was a bit different. This pizza was messier and a little more difficult to eat than the truffle one since with one bite, you'd just end up eating the entire giant slice of coppa. But it's okay! The pizza is interesting. My bf liked it a lot. I still prefer the lobster mushroom, truffle cheese pizza more.Gosh. When can I come back???//editOH YEAH.TIP: Don't sit at the two-seater tables in the back near the toilet. Holy BAJEEZUS. We were sat down at the one right next to the bathroom and it stunk to high heaven of week old piss!!You see, I had completely forgot to mention this earlier because the godly delicious pizza totally overshadowed the stinking-pee memory but I DO remember it.

Waitress frequently checked up on us and refilled our waters.Food was good but not great. The four of us shared the pork belly salad starter. For four people, it was definitely not enough pork belly, as it came with 3 pieces, and about a small handful of salad. The portion was a little small but the pork belly was perfectly cooked. Reminded me of Cantonese roast pork with a thick layer of crispy skin, a layer of fat that melts in your mouth, followed by a succulent piece of pork. MMMM. Could have used a bit more greens to balance the fattiness of the pork belly though.As for the pizzas, we chose to share the cheese, lobster mushroom & truffle oil pizza and the duck egg pizza. I thought that the cheese on the mushroom pizza was a bit overwhelmingly, making the medium-thin crust pizza seem heavier than it is. The duck egg pizza was more coppa than duck egg and could have used more greens to balance the saltiness of the coppa. Both pizzas had quality toppings but I could not eat more than 4 slices because they were so rich in cheese or coppa. If rich pizza if your thing, Serious Pie is the place to go.

But the Clam pizza won for most unique application of clams as a topping, and use of spice, this one had a nice kick to it.Fennel Sausage was tasty and familiar since it was the only pizza that we ordered that had marinara sauce on it.Potato Rosemary was generously salted and its flavor was a good \"neutralizer\" between the bites of clam and sausage.TWO days later!Tried the Lemon pizza and the truffle cheeseTruffle fell flat in comparison to the lemon pizza. But both were still tasty and were quickly devoured.My ONLY complaint(s):Would love to see some more meat toppings and also \u00a0wished the pizzas were larger for the price.However I would DEFINATELY recommend dining here, service was great!

We tried a chantarelles and truffle cheese pizza, one with fennel sausage on a tomato based sauce, and another, the special of the day with house cured salami.When the pizzas come out, three is plenty to feel all four of us seated in my party. The chantarelles were strong and very mushroomy for the mushroom lovers. The salumi was pretty good, but got lost in some of the weight of the cheese and crust. The fennel sausage was likely my favorite, with the tomato brining a good balance.The crust on be pies was hot, chewy, and substantial, which may be why these weren't my favorite pizzas I've ever had. I prefer my crusts thinner, and the pizzas were really quite heavy of a meal.They do have Mexican coke.

I've only been there once so far. We had tried to go months ago but the wait was too long, what was nice is that we went next door to Dahlia Lounge and they managed to sneak us in with no wait on a Saturday night. Since they don't take reservations we went at 9:30 on a Sunday to guarantee no wait and we had the right time, got seated right away.When you walk in you are greeted by their giant pizza oven adorned with giant boulder-like rocks that make it look like they are cooking pizza in a mountain. The host was very friendly and took us to our table which was semi-communal but they weren't cramming people in like sardines so that wasn't a problem.The menu is very seasonal so these items may not be available when you go. There is a lot of stuff with only Italian names but they are happy to explain them to you and seemed to expect to have to do so. For example when we were ordering dessert I asked \"Can you tell me what.....\" and she said \"the budino?\" before I could even finish so I imagine the Italian word for pudding is not common knowledge in Seattle.Fava bean puree crostini: Fabulous. Very thin toasty bread with parmesan shavings, smoked pancetta crumbles, and seasoned pureed fava beans.Yukon gold, rosemary, and pecorino pizza: \u00a0The crust is to die for. Extremely light and crunchy without being crackery. Little bits of charred without tasting like charcoal. The corners had just the right amount of chewiness. The toppings were great and there were some perfect bites but I think this pizza would benefit from some sauce as some bites seemed dry. Chocolate budino: Chocolate hazelnut pudding with sea salt. Holy crap this was good. Imagine a Theo hazelnut crunch bar (my favorite) blended up into a pudding.Cannoli: The shells were perfectly crispy and not too dense. The filling was not the usual dense chunks of ricotta in your average cannoli, it had the right ricotta flavor while being almost fluffy. The little bites of apricot were a great addition.The pizzas are supposedly single serving size but are generously portioned if that is the case. If I had not shared the pizza we could not have had dessert or an appetizer. I would recommend ordering a couple of apps and a pizza, or an app a pizza and dessert. We had an appetizer, a pizza, two desserts, and a few drinks. Our bill for 2 was $70.We will definitely be back, we would be back more often if they took reservations.

It's definitely good pizza, so I'm OK averaging our two scores.First I'll just reiterate that the pizzas are very expensive and the space is quite small. But I really appreciated the size of the restaurant, partly because Wifey and I got our own table - it looked like other small groups just got put together at larger tables. As for the pizza, the two of us basically finished both pizzas. By way of reference, we were both pretty hungry but neither of us is a big eater. But I would say that splitting a pizza between two people is probably not a good plan unless you don't eat much or are getting some other sides.For pizzas, we got the Yukon potato (upon Yelp's recommendation) and a special. The potato pizza was really good, but it was just a lot of potato. I think I would have liked it a lot more if I only had to eat a quarter of it as opposed to a half. Someone else on here described it as a large potato chip and that's not a bad way of putting it. They are little slices of crispy potatoes on top that give it nice texture.I liked the special we got a lot more. It had prosciutto, goat cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes (plus some other things, it was a while ago). Really high-quality ingredients; I don't think I've ever had goat cheese on a pizza before. I was unsure how it'd be. I am a big goat cheese fan, and luckily it didn't disappoint.Oh, one last thing. We each got one of the beers on tap. I got the Schooner Brown Ale and Wifey got the pilsner.

One pizza, despite costing $17, feeds a single person.Honestly, I have ordered many of their pizzas, but my favorite is still the simple \"buffalo mozzarella\" which is their variant of a cheese pizza.

It's delicious, SERIOUSLY. If you're a fan of truffle oil, there's no going wrong with this pizza!The pizza's here are a bit more like flatbread. I don't think the pies are big enough to share one across two people, but I definitely recommend ordering a few pizzas within your party and sharing. I've had a slice of a Squash/Goat Cheese pizza - also DELICIOUS. The squash is a bit sweet, but this is countered with the salty flavor added to the crust. Each pie comes with 6 slices...about 4 should fill you up. The decor is casual here, and you can see into the attached kitchen (may be shared with Dahlia?). Seating is community style, so they may seat you in the middle of a couple parties. I'm SURE this can get awkward...but fortunately, I haven't had an weird experiences with this. In fact, during my first visit, the party seated next to us was very friendly and fun. We all ended up chatting throughout dinner!A few tips:- No reservations. Wait times can vary, but expect it to be long.(Was an HOUR the first time i went...but no wait the second time - both were Wednesday nights 7:30p). - Community Seating - be warned...can get weird. - Only serve Beer and Mexican coca cola (no diet version...made with real sugar)- Parking is tough...but this goes for all Seattle's DowntownOverall: You can TASTE the high quality of the pizza's at Serious Pie.

Granted that this place is pretty small, I think that it still speaks volumes about the popularity of the non-traditional pizza toppings you're offered at Serious Pie. This is a Tom Douglas restaurant, which gives it a special status all its own because Douglas is an amazing chef and one of the pioneers of Pacific Northwestern, or \"Pacific Rim,\" culinary excellence and taste. Douglas also runs the Dhalia Lounge, the Dhalia Bakery, Lola, and Etta's (see my review about this amazing seafood restaurant). Although I have not gone to the first three Douglas restaurants I list above, I have been told that they are among the best in Seattle.Something to note: while waiting outside, you can count on one or more encounters with homeless persons because the alley right next to the restaurant is where many of them seem to have made home. At no point did my wife or I feel uncomfortable, but it can be kind of annoying when they begin to hound you for money.Once inside Serious Pie, you get a noseful of wood-fired pizza crust aroma and an earful of chatter. One of the many unique features of Serious Pie is that you sit at long tables shared with other patrons, which was great for us because we got a chance to interact with some Seattle natives. The space is really small, so expect to brush elbows with everyone around you and every one of the waiters. Don't be put off by this fact because this is what gives this place half of its charm.The pizza here is stellar. Many other yelpers complain about the crust being too oily, but I think that it is great because it is a very light olive oil and helps for some finishing salts to stick to the dough. The combination of the wood fired cooking, oil and salts makes for a supreme crust and crisp flavor. The toppings are different and they offer one a chance to explore completely different flavor combinations--like the lemon, olive and dried Japanese chili pizza. Yes, the pizza literally has slices of lemon on it, which contrary to what you may be thinking, make the pizza 10 times tastier than any pineapple and Canadian bacon you've ever had. The lemon slices bake and are softened, and because they are baked, they lose their acidity.I also tried the \"safest\" pizza on the menu--the brussel sprouts, pancetta and buffalo mozzarella. Although the flavors totally worked together, it doesn't really go too far out of the box for those of us looking for something totally different. But don't underestimate the tastiness of this pizza. The brussel sprouts and pancetta go great together and offer a hardy, enjoyable meal.Note that the menu does seem to change, as we went to Serious Pie with some pizzas in mind that we had read about on other Yelp reviews, but we didn't find any of them. Rather, we found some versions of them, where one or more ingredients had changed, but the overall idea of the pizza stayed the same. My guess is that the ingredients used change because of the seasonality for each ingredient.", "Date": "2011-01-03", "Author_Location": "Pasadena, CA"}, {"Author": "Juha K.", "ReviewID": "xZlj83Fn_31FCmv-LvMrDA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After hearing about their chanterelle pizza in \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" I just had to have it!Sunchoke starter was very good, nice texture of the sunchokes combined with onion and other goodies was just enough to wake the taste buds.Pizza was absolutely top notch!

The food is not responsible for the minus 1-star rating, but the dining experience is.Let's begin with the food. Incredible ingredients (fresh local produce and house-cured meats) create a pizza experience like no other. I have had the pleasure of enjoying several of the pizzas, however the Yukon Gold Potato is my favorite. You really can't go wrong with any of them, but my personal preference makes me favor this one the most. In addition to the pizzas, the starters are fantastic. It seems like this menu changes with the season based on what fruit and vegetables are best at that point in time. I have never been disappointed with any of the starters and I feel they are all fantastic.Now for the non-amazing aspects of Serious Pie. The decor of both restaurants is great. However, the cafeteria, family-style vibe of the table seating is kind of annoying. There are long high-tables that seat 6 throughout the restaurant. Thus, if you have a party of 3, the third in the party will be sitting across from a complete stranger. I feel this style of seating negates from the overall experience.

My NESP liked it far more than I did.4. \u00a0mushroom pizza (not the one on their regular menu I don't think) - tis was also a little salty and heavy for me, and the fresh mushroom flavor was a little overpowered by the truffle oil flavor. \u00a0Still good though. 5. \u00a0guanciale, soft egg, arugula - this pizza was fine, but not greater than the some of its parts. * eating undercooked eggs may increase risk of food borne illness", "Date": "2011-03-27", "Author_Location": "Philadelphia, PA"}, {"Author": "Dave C.", "ReviewID": "3Oy9_EDdFCbRd_9-s_9ewg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the better places for pizza on the west coast, perfect crust, glutenous but not overworked dough, light and airy with huge blisters \u00a0all over the crust, great caramelization, a smidge heavy on the salt in the dough itself, but it helps brings out the flavors in the most cruicial component of any great pizza.

Like all the other Tom Douglas spots, they don't take reservations, so the wait for a table can be ridiculously long when things get busy.

Sure, I've enjoyed the handful of meals I've had at his restaurants, but I think there are other fantastic chefs in Seattle who consistently produce equally if not more exciting food.Serious Pie underwhelmed me. It just seems really over-hyped. The pizza is good, certainly... but who in their right mind wants to wait 30+ minutes for a pizza?! It's not *that* good! None of the pizzas were a total miss, but none of them hit it out of the park for me, either... the price is steep enough and the wait is long enough that I expected to be wow'ed.The sweet fennel sausage pizza was our table's favorite - sometimes simple is good! While it was tasty, though, I wouldn't say it was the best oven-baked pizza I've had... the crust seemed too thin in the middle (almost soggy in some places, as it was saturated with sauce), and the outer crust was a bit thin for my taste. For a less traditional pie, we liked the pizza with house ham, braised leeks, fontina cheese, and huckleberries, although I wish the cheese had been sliced a bit thinner (and spread more evenly) so that the other toppings could balance it out. The Yukon gold potato with rosemary and pecorino cheese sounded great on paper, but in practice it was very bland - as with most of the pizzas, it featured an olive oil base rather than red sauce (the sausage pizza was the exception). This idea only works if the toppings pack a punch, and unfortunately the potato pizza seemed more like glorified flatbread to me. TD, please offer more pizza with regular sauce - even pesto would be an improvement!!I was also disappointed that they only offer two draft beers and a handful of bottles. The wine selection is somewhat better... but seriously, this is Seattle. If you're going to have a pizza joint, even a fancy one, offering a solid variety of on-tap local microbrews is a requirement.There are no reservations, and while you can put your name on the list upon arrival, you cannot be seated until your entire party arrives.

We arrive at around 11:25 in the am. \u00a0Serious Pie is approximately 25% full. \u00a0We are seated at the far end of a communal table located directly adjacent to the walkway between the restaurant area and the back of the restaurant. \u00a0A pane of glass provides a view into to the workings of the mighty Tom Douglas bakery. \u00a0After a noticably long wait, our waiter arrives to take our order - we order a salad that is on the special list, the potato pizza, and a chantrelle and truffle pizza. \u00a0My wife notices a large line of hungry customers waiting to get in. \u00a0Boy, we say, aren't we lucky that we got our order in before this big crush of customers. \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Lucky. \u00a0 A nice couple with their kids is seated beside us at our communal table. \u00a0The waiter arrives and takes their order. \u00a0We notice the absence of our salad, but my wife has spotted it sitting on the pass. \u00a0Our salad sits lonely and neglected. \u00a0I occasionally glance at it. \u00a0I can sense that it is waiting for someone, anyone to send it to its final destination. \u00a0Alas, it is not to be. \u00a0Our poor salad is doomed to rise to room temperature and wilt in the heat of the kitchen before it is dispatched to our table. \u00a0We partake of our forlorn salad and it is true - the salad is overdressed and the arugala is wilted and slightly slimy. \u00a0Oh well, we say. \u00a0We notice that it's now past noon and manners allow us to now \u00a0imbibe. \u00a0We gain the attention of our waiter and each ask if we might be so fortunate as to have a glass of the house prosecco brought to the table to keep us company since our pizzas have yet to arrive. \u00a0I can't help but notice the nice couple next to us have not only finished of their salads, but are now happily chowing down on their pizzas. \u00a0I can't help but notice that there are many other people in the now packed restaurant that arrived quite some time after us who are also eating pizza. \u00a0I look through the window in the bakery at the Tom Douglas bakers - even they are happily eating baked goods! \u00a0Yes, it seems, when it comes to our pizzas, they are saving the best for very, very last. \u00a0However, good news everyone! \u00a0Our waiter has assured us that our pizza will be *right out*. \u00a0Oh boy, we will be eating soon. \u00a0Yes sir. \u00a0Eating of pizza will happen. \u00a010 more minutes pass, and it is now bordering on an absurd wait time. \u00a0Directly behind me, I hear a heated conversation underway between our waiter and the pizza cook. \u00a0Drama! \u00a0Excellent! \u00a0I wasn't expecting entertainment with my non-pizza, but what the hell. \u00a0It's almost like opera (imagine this sung by Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras):Waiter: \u00a0Where is the pizza? \u00a0For table....24?Cook: \u00a0I didn't receive a ticket. \u00a0For table....24!Waiter: \u00a0Didn't you see them? \u00a0They have no food!Cook: \u00a0I saw the people beside them! \u00a0Eating food!I am the creative type, so I can't help but get involved. \u00a0I want Andrea Boccelli to sing my part.Me: \u00a0I've had enough of this, we are leaving!Waiter: \u00a0Yes, of course you are! \u00a0Sir! \u00a0Your lunch is! \u00a0On the house!Me: \u00a0What lunch? \u00a0You didn't bring it!Also, if Tom Douglas or any other local restauranteur is reading this and thinks they are going to be a grand innovator by instituting communal seating in the hopes of creating a more social atmoshere, can I just say that there are few things less humilitating as a restaurant patron than being completely ignored by the wait staff and your cooks before having them create a huge dramatic scene that inevitably draws you in while a crowd of complete strangers who are sitting literally less than five inches away from you stare on in either bemusement or bewilderment? \u00a0Got that? \u00a0Thanks.Anyway, my wife and I attempt to extricate ourselves from Serious Pie, and someone who I can only assume is the manager determines from my furrowed brow and snarling lip that I didn't have a pleasant dining experience at one of the Tom Douglas group of restaurants. \u00a0I give her the five second rundown - nearly an hour; no food. \u00a0She is genuinely apologetic and offers me a Tom Douglas group of restaurants gift card. \u00a0However, at this point I am so angry and hungry that there is really nothing she could have offered me to placate me.

You won't find such a concentration of amazing pizza joints anywhere else in America - throw a stone and it will likely land on a delicious pie in the town.This being said, Serious Pie put in a good effort. The topping combos - including exciting non-traditional additions such as soft egg, truffle cheese, and penn cove clams in some pies - are inventive and mouth-watering. \u00a0We ordered the traditional margherita-style pie and were satisfied with the generous, tangy pizza sauce that smothered the paper-thin crust. \u00a0The fresh buffalo mozzarella was melted perfectly and the local fresh basil added the right amount of freshness to the pizza. \u00a0We were very happy with it - until we got to the crust.

I was planning a Seattle visit in the next few days to see my cousin, so I figured this would be a good place to have lunch. And boy, was I right. If you go there between 3 and 5 on Monday-Friday, you can get half sized pizzas for $5 a pop. This is what we did when I went there with my boyfriend and cousin. I was first expecting to order one half sized pizza for each of us until I saw some come out. They're quite small, I'm not even a very big eater and I would want two for myself, so we decided to order a couple different pizzas; one with buffalo mozzarella and san marzano tomato, one with yukon gold potato, rosemary and olive oil, one with cherry bomb peppers, sweet fennel sausage, one with roasted chanterelles, truffle cheese, and one with house salumi, walla walla onions, and cacio cavallo. Odd ingredients, I know. I had to ask our waitress what quite a few of the items were. Every single pizza was delicious, though. I absolutely loved it. My favorites were the buffalo mozzarella one and the house salumi one, they're heaven on earth. We even ordered a few extra to bring home.

Or did I still it from an existing ad; or, better yet, was it incepted into my brain while I was in a dream, within a dream, within a dream (OK, in a year that joke will be so outdated)? Eh, I cheerfully digress. Serious Pie has some really delicious pizzas. First of all, this particular branch is a cozy restaurant tucked next to a U-stop parking lot. BTW, for all y'all tourists (and/or ignorami like us) out there, make sure you're paying the correct machine when you're parking at the U-Stop Parking lot, it's the one with the big giant finger saying \"Pay Here.\" Just a friendly reminder. That is all. The interior is wonderful. It's warm and wooden, with oversized paintings and soft wall colors. I think the kitchen's twice as big as the dining area, and people are seated in communal tables. We decided to go for three pizzas: buffalo mozarella and roma tomatoes, clam/pancetta/thyme, and chanterelles/truffle cheese. Sounds simple, but the tastes are explosive. It reminds me of that plain-sounding prosciutto/cheese pizza that I inhaled @ Pizza Nea in Minneapolis. The clam pizza was a little sweet and briny from the tiny clams, but also has pops of saltiness from the pancetta. The cheese pizza is unadulterated and scarfable down. Or is it scarf down-able? But my favorite was the mushroom pizza. Holy gawd, that pizza was epic. The mushrooms were earthy and the cheese was unctuous but not too much, just the right amount of grease to make you feel like you're eating comfort food, not food coma food. And, of course, all these pizzas come from a wood burning oven, so you know that crust is money.

It's probably the best artisan pizza I've ever had. HOSTING and SERVICEWe arrived for dinner and the place was packed, but the hostess took our mobile # to give us a call when our table was ready. While we waited, we had cocktails at the Dahlia Lounge across the street.We were seated in about 20 minutes and from there service was quick and exceptional. The servers were courteous and friendly, and very accommodating. My friend ordered a chianti that was a little too warm, and the waiter graciously brought out a new bottle and had him try the glass it to make sure it was to his liking.FOODThe pizza was excellent! They are \"personal\" sized, so between the 4 of us, we had 3 different kinds of pizzas. Their pizzas are based on fresh ingredients that are in season. Two of us ordered the buffalo mozzarella with san marzano tomatoes, another had the chanterelle mushrooms with truffle cheese, and the other had the delicata squash, roasted garlic, gorgonzola lucifero. I tried a slice of each pizza and I can't say there was one that I didn't like! The ingredients were fresh, the crust, was light, the seasoning was just right! Each left me wanting more. All that said, it's not an inexpensive place - but you definitely get your money's worth.LOCATION and CROWDWe arrived for dinner on a Thursday night and it was pretty busy so I can only imagine what weekends are like.

While we waited for our table we walked around the corner to Dahlia's Bakery...another place we'd ready about...and couldn't resist sampling the triple coconut cream pie (mini-bites). More about the pie further down.Serious is small and mostly has community tables so we had the opportunity to chat with three young men also vacationing and later a nice couple from Denmark who was actually living in Seattle for awhile. The intimate atmosphere and bustle of the waitresses slipping among the crowd made for an almost homey atmosphere and fostered an easy conversation among those at the table with us.We had the chanterelle flatbread, the cucumber salad and the chopped salad. The flatbread had a wonderful taste of garlic oil and the toasty nut-like flavor of the chanterelles. My wife, who doesn't care for mushrooms, is still talking about how good the mushrooms were and she may be leaning to trying again. The cucumbers were fresh and crisp (no doubt from Pikes Market) and the chopped salad would be a regular treat for me if I was local It was the perfect first meal in Seattle after the flight from Las Vegas.Now, back to the triple coconut cream pie. WOW! We love coconut and Dahlia's triple coconut cream pie was on the Serious menu. Well, we had to have more than the mini-bites we tried earlier so we dug into a healthy slice and it will remain among my list of 'best pies ever'...and may just be the single biggest reason I want to go back to Seattle.

'Cause I can, with all the hype I expected better. First off this serious pie was SALTY! Dominoes or pizza hut would of been better than this dump. People all because it's salted meats (pepperoni, sausage, & etc.) does not mean your entire pizza should taste like salt! For waiting almost an hour I assumed it would be worth it. I was wrong! Let's list all the cons, because I honestly have no pros.-The wait was ridiculously long for 'pie' and a little unorganized-They make you sit family style with people who are not your family; example they sit 3 couples together in a small tight table together cramped in a table for 6. They don't even ask for your preference. It's not even a large table; it's 3 small tables put together that they don't separate because I assume the place is too tight to space out the tables.-When they sit you in family they do not tell the waiters, so they take one person's order assuming that one person is ordering for everyone; ignoring everyone else in the party and leaving you to starve until you-the customer, flag them down. That's NOT what I plan on doing after waiting almost an hour-They just about NEVER just on you to see if everything is okay or if you need a refill on beverages-This particular Tom Douglas location makes me claustrophobic; even the lobby is just about non-existing.- The pizza was not delectable. My yukon potato was oily, the other pizza filled with meat was salty. Both were not pleasing so we did not take it to-go. We only ate half of each pizza because we waited so long we were starving. Once our state of mind was back to normal we noticed that taste was not worth the wait. We should of gone somewhere else. Lesson learned. Not coming back anytime soon.If you're ever in my neck of the woods; los angeles CA, try petrillo, even with the tons of meat it doe not have the overwhelming taste of salt, which leaves you thirsty all night.Tom Douglas with so many delicious restaurants I was REALLY let down by this one.

This makes me extremely happy, as I think it might be the world's most perfect pizza place. Let's examine the evidence:1. Amazing service. On my last visit, Serious Pie had the most patient, professional, friendly hostess I've ever encountered. There were some obnoxious patrons waiting with us, and she handled them gracefully and with a smile. When our order took a little longer than normal, our server appeared with a free order of marinated olives. We hadn't even noticed the delay... that's how good the service was.2. Great beers on tap. You can't enjoy pizza without a draft beer. I'm pretty sure it's just impossible.3. Communal tables which are somehow not awkward. How does this work so well at Serious Pie but so poorly everywhere else? .4. Availability via room service to my home away from home, The Hotel Andra. I can't even tell you how excited I was when I first discovered this.5. Excellent value. The pizzas are large enough to share, and at under $20 per pie, this makes for a pretty cheap night out - especially given the quality.6. Do I even have to say it? The best... pizza... EVER. I love the wood fired crusts. I love all the toppings. The Penn Cove clam/pancetta pizza is probably my favorite but I don't know that it's possible for me to order something I don't like at Serious Pie.The world's most perfect pizza place? I rest my case. In fact, writing this review is giving me some serious cravings... I think I need to head back to Serious Pie immediately.

The toppings are simple, unexpected, and delightful. I've never had a pie I didn't like though some can be a bit saltier than others. My hands-down favorite is what old timers know as the 'Cherry Bomb', more popularly known as the Sweet Fennel Sausage. Light eaters can get away with one pizza for two with a side but most folks will want their own. Besides, multiple pies means sharing and there are lots of great flavors to try. Don't let the ingredients intimidate you. Never had clams on a pizza? Trust Tom. Just do it.Because the pizzas are are smaller and lighter than the typical doughy disaster, you won't find them too filling. The side dishes are always fresh and seasonal, and the desserts are flavorful without being too sweet or heavy. The downtown restaurant is small and provides a more European, communal dining experience. Large tables seat 8 people but are usually split among smaller parties. It isn't uncommon for one table to have group of four and two parties of two seated together. Its intimate and can get crowed but you can still have a comfortable and personal dining experience. Its also popular and they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour during the during rush. Arrive early or late for faster seating, or try a night other than Thu-Sat. No matter how crowded the restaurant though, the service is always friendly and efficient. I really appreciate that kind of consistency.Bottom line, Serious Pie is fantastic.

I have a simple/boring palate so that's probably why I like this the most.2. Prosser pumpkin, pork belly, pistachios ($17): This has a nice soft texture with the pumpkin (reminds me of sweet potatoes topping on pizza) and also brings lots of that good pumpkin flavor. The pork belly is a nice compliment, and it really adds to the pizza.3. Sweet fennel sausage and roasted red peppers ($17): The sausages were really good, in fact, most of my friends like this the best. High quality tasty sausages. The roasted red peppers took away more than it offered in highlighting the sausage. This was good but not my favorite.4.

It has a very warm feel; I liked the art work, the awesome light fixtures, and the windows make it feel very open. I enjoyed the giant pub tables and really didn't mind sitting with strangers (added bonus, the tables have hooks for your bags). It is also kinda cool that it is sunken into the street a bit, this makes it feel like a real hidden gem when your inside. We dined on the pizza of the day, it was an olive oil based pizza with english peas, caramelized onions, goat cheese, and basil. I had all intentions of trying the yukon pie, but after hearing that description I couldn't say no. The pizza is small but my husband and I split it and left content. The goat cheese was fluffy and delicious, but the onions were the highlight. Who says that about their meal? Let me reiterate, the onions were the highlight! I am not sure what they were caramelized in, but they were so flavorful I could have eaten them by the pound. The crust was thick and crisp on the outside, but soft on the inside. I'm not one to finish my crust, but there was no way I was leaving any remnants of this pizza. So good! They definitely earned bonus points when the waitress offered us some complimentary foccia bread to go...umm yes please. We ended up splitting it with a friend and it was fantastic. Crisp and salty on the outside and fluffy, light, and airy on the inside. I love that they step outside of the box with their pizza toppings and their creativity definitely pays off.

Wasn't that a Seinfeld episode? I dream of a world in which all the restaurants I visit will have a hostess like Rochelle. First off, this branch of Serious Pie is pretty small. It fits probably 10-15 tables in a very cozy space. We knew this ahead of time and figured that we should get there early to make sure we could get a table. We showed up and were pleasantly surprised to find the wait was only 15 minutes or so. Unfortunately, the rest of our table was not there, so we had to take our chances to see if they'd get there before our table was ready. No go. At just about that time, we find out there's a 70,000 person video gaming convention in town and we see the first gamers start drifting in. Luckily, Rochelle went way above and beyond to make sure that when our party was all there, she found us a table quickly. While we were waiting, she was fun to talk to and she even told us that when she gets solo diners, she'll try to hook them up with a friendly table where the diner can hopefully make some new friends. We started off with the baby lettuce and radishes. A healthy-sized salad to share that highlighted the fresh radishes. As you enjoy your appetizers or pre-meal drinks, you watch these amazing pizzas slide out of the brick oven. Nicely baked and crispy crusts puffed up with airy pockets. Pizza #1: yukon gold potato, rosemary, pecorino. Don't get potatoes on pizza too often, but on this pizza, they were well cooked and well seasoned. Pizza #2: buffalo mozzarella, red sauce, fresh basil. The classic margherita. Big slices of mozzarella melted over a tasty (not too acidic) red sauce. Could have done with a bit more basil, but still a great pie. Pizza #3: sweet fennel sausage, roasted peppers, provolone. Love the sweet fennel sausage. Roasted peppers added good flavor to the pizza and it didn't get overpowered by the provolone cheese. The pizzas are also pretty big. We got 3 pizzas for 4 people and a kid and probably could have walked out with leftovers if we had somewhere to keep it. I suppose they are serious about their pies here.

It makes a pie that is truly delicious, in fact is makes 7 pies, four of which I tried and loved. I got to try all these on two visits, one when I came for dinner and four when I went with someone to happy hour, the greatest darn deal you may ever see in your life, unless they sold them for four dollars instead of five. The first pizza I tried was the Yukon gold potato which was really great. Each ingredient shined through and the pairings were amazing. The thinly sliced potato balance great with the rosemary. This might have been my favorite pie, but the Cherry bomb peppers pie with fennel sausage was amazing too. It is without a doubt one of the best-est sausage pizzas you will ever eat, and it is the most popular pie at this place for a reason. I wasn't terribly impressed by the more modest and traditional san marzano and buffalo mozz pizza, it was good but not the best interpretation of the classic combination I have had and not the best pizza at Serious Pie.This might be a good time to say that the airiness of the crust is wonderful, and I do disagree with some comments that the crust had too much cornmeal. Now to the last pizza I tried on my second visit. The Penn Cove Clam pie is good, and I was rewarded for ignoring my continuing fear of seafood on a pizza with a pie that had a great balance of saltiness and sourness (from the lemon) which came together for a memorable flavor. I also tried a winter squash and pesto appetizer which I don't think is on the menu anymore, so I won't go into any deeper detail other than to say it was quite tasty. The cannoli dessert is the kind of dessert that will have you desperately trying to spoon out the last beads of cream and sauce from the bottom of the plate. The cannoli hits all the right notes and is accented by a few interesting toppings like pine nuts. It's a great way to finish off after some great pizza.The wait is very long on weekend nights, usually in excess of an hour, so go really late or find something to do in area (not much within walking distance on cold and very rainy night, so we just had some tea and read newspapers in the sitting area at Ralph's Grocer around the corner) as the restaurant will call your cell when your table is just about ready.

Wow... the first bite into the clam pizza, I could definitely taste the lemon juice and the clams had great texture and flavor. The crust and bread itself had a slightly salty flavor to it and had a nice crunch. The garlic sausage pizza, one of the more traditional flavors on the menu, was savory and rich. The rustico cheese with the red pepper flakes provided a nice spice kick to balance the sweetness of the sausage and eggplant.

Sometimes truffles can overpower the palate, but I found myself reaching for piece after piece because the flavor combination was so compelling and addictive!  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My friends and I also ordered the cherry bomb pepper and sweet fennel sausage pie.

What they make is flatbread with toppings. Overpriced flatbread with toppings. I went to Serious Pie under the mistaken impression that they were a pizza place after seeing an episode of The Best Thing I Ever Ate on Food Network. Serious Pie was the pick of Tyler Florence. Against my better judgement, I chose to follow the advice of someone who said the best pizza in the country, nay the world, was on the US west coast. Well, there's a reason my better judgement is against making such mistakes. Serious Pie is not bad, it's just not good, and at $15 for a personal size cheese, it better be amazing. You can tell the ingredients are high quality, and the crust is pretty good, if a bit thick at times (crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside). The problem is that the total is less than the sum of its parts. They do a great job of balancing flavors. So great in fact that the end product ends up tasting largely of nothing. It's not unpleasant the way some bland things are, it just... well, tastes of nothing. I don't really know how else to describe it. Being from NY, I have been accused of being a pizza snob, and I would grant that I probably am. I think the measure of a pizza place is the cheese pizza. The cheese pizza is the purest, most fundamental form of pizza, and if a place can't do that right, they may as well just give up. I ordered a cheese pizza and a cannoli at Serious Pie, and both exhibited the lack of any appreciable flavor mentioned above. The textural experience was nice, but the flavor profiles just fell completely flat. If they charged about 1/2 the prices they do, it would have been worthy as a reasonable hole in the wall quality pizza joint. But they charge what I would consider fine dining prices for product that doesn't even match the quality of the best frozen foods. If you want pizza in Seattle, I would send you to Post Alley Pizza downtown, A New York Pizza Place up in Montlake, Hot Momma's up on Cap Hill, or any of the Paggliacis around the city before even considering Serious Pie. I'd even suggest going to the IGA downtown to pick up a frozen A New York Pizza Place branded frozen pizza before going to this place.", "Date": "2010-02-21", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Julie J.", "ReviewID": "cs4NWJMq1Y6Jyl32uDvy7Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Walked in on a Sunday evening at 6pm--it was packed! \u00a0We gave our number and received a call 35 minutes later that a table was ready.Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. \u00a0We ordered the roasted yellowfoot mushrooms with truffle cheese and buffalo mozzarella with san marzano tomato pizzas. \u00a0The latter was a bit salty--but overall, a satisfying meal. \u00a0The red 10-year anniversary wine they are serving at the moment is fantastic--complex yet still pair-able with veggie-based pizzas.", "Date": "2010-02-24", "Author_Location": "Edmonds, WA"}, {"Author": "Erin K.", "ReviewID": "jYV-2ZOFkVKgW-8vgY4rmQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Serious Pie.

Although this review is applicable to both locations, I do think the downtown location on Virginia is slightly better, I don't know why, it just is. The parking is easier at the SLU location and if you come during brunch hours, a patron also has the opportunity for Serious Biscuit, so take your pick! As for what's good, mostly everything. The menu does change, so beware. The crust is salty goodness on all pizzas but it stands out the most with the (insert mushroom type) and truffle cheese, which is also my favorite. The usual suspects of buffalo moz and then a sweet funnel sausage pies are safe bets. On occasion, but it's been a while (*HINT HINT*) the brussel sprout with garlic is an excellent special, especially if you haven't or don't like much maligned veggie. One memorable pie I had only once, a house salumi (I think), caramelized onion, and fontina cheese was quite enjoyable too. But I think almost anything with caramelized onion is good, even one of the servers agreed with me. The desserts are also optional but for me necessary. If the budino (pudding) is on the menu, it's my default selection. But a close second is the recent addition of the cannoli with honey poached pears with a pomegrate drizzle. And trailing in third [only because I ordered my first 1/2 dozen times I ate here) is a dramatically overdone coconut cream pie.

We waited LITERALLY fifteen minutes for the douchebag to even acknowledge us and ask for our drink order, as he went to get our beverages we noticed that we hadn't even gotten our specials menu, the table next to us had so as he delivered our drinks we asked for the specials menu. \u00a0The table next to us, clearly sympathetic to our bad luck offered us theirs as they had already ordered, so as he came back and saw that the couple at the other table had given us theirs, he actually sighed and rolled his eyes at us. \u00a0I don't know what happened to this guy for him to behave in such a manner, I imagine he had probably walked in on his best friend banging his girlfriend a few hours earlier. \u00a0But, we were determined not to let this ruin our meal, being chefs we were both super excited about the pizzas we'd be eating soon. \u00a0They have a happy hour special where you can get miniature, appetizer sized versions of their pizza which was right up our alley. \u00a0We ordered the cherry bomb pizza and another with guanciale, poached egg, arugula and egg, with parmesan. \u00a0Our pizzas were prepared promptly and the cherry bomb pizza was fabulous: nice char on the crust which created an amazing chewy/crispy texture, flavors were well balanced, everything perfectly seasoned. \u00a0The other pizza was delicious too, save for a lack of Guanciale. \u00a0We took a couple of bites and then proceeded to tear apart the pizza in search of this fabled guanciale. \u00a0It wasn't there, which is fine as chefs my girlfriend and i knew that these things happen, people make mistakes, no problem. \u00a0So we informed our server that there was no guanciale in the pizza and he proceeded to tell us that indeed there was and that it was cut very thinly and underneath everything so we didn't notice it. \u00a0REALLY??? first tenet of service is that the customer is ALWAYS right so even if it WAS on the pizza he should have apologized to us and fix it. \u00a0Second of all we're chefs, did he really think we wouldn't be able to detect the flavor of PIG JOWL LEFT TO HANG IN A CELLAR FOR THREE WEEKS?? \u00a0Well he asked us if we wanted another one and we said no, we'll just take the check (which warranted another sigh and roll of the eyes). \u00a0Upon giving us the check he said... and I quote \"I spoke with the manager and the guanciale pizza is free of charge, but just so you know the guanciale WAS on there\" \u00a0Wow, i guess he wanted the last laugh, so we gave it to him. \u00a0We tipped 20 percent just to show him that we were the bigger people, he was probably too dumb to even perceive that insult. \u00a0SO... 4.75 out of 5 on the food, some truly amazing pizza but A zero for service and the worst server i've ever had the displeasure to meet", "Date": "2010-03-19", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Gia G.", "ReviewID": "bSQJQDMNCQPtryRFHToc4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yum. Yum. And YUM! Totally found this place through Yelp. I wasn't sure what to expect and once I got inside and saw the very small dining area and very simple menu I was really concerned. Being from Chicago I expect my pizzas to be big and varied. This place has 4-5 pizza choices and they are all the same size. The appetizer menu is pretty brief as well, but we settled on the cured meats plate, which came with marinated olives, real parmesan cheese, and delicious Washington almonds. We got the sweet fennel sausage and roasted red peppers pizza and it was probably the best pizza I've ever had. Ever! Chicago and New York be damned. The pizza is absolutely, ridiculously delicious! You can see the pizza-makers pouring their heart and soul into each pie from just about anywhere you sit. The crust is fresh and perfectly baked. The ingredients are fresh and seasoned just right. I have absolutely nothing negative to say. On top of all that they had a great hard cider to wash it all done with. Serious Pie is truly serious about their pies!
