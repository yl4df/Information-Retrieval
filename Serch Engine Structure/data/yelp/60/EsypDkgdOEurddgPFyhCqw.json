The sauce has a creamy, mayo-thousand island twist that gives just a slight kick. I gave the \"carne-asada fries,\" a try since life in San Diego has turned me into a carne-asada fries regular. I guess La Vics and Iguanas takes a different approach to their fries, and makes them more like nachos, by smothering them with nacho cheese sauce. There is also less shredded cheese, and less guacamole. To be honest, these fries do not stand a chance against Lolitas or Vallartas of San Diego. The fries are only crispy for a few seconds, the carne asada was just alright, and by the end--whatever was left, was soggy/drenched in nacho sauce. Good thing they have the sauce here, because the fries wouldn't stand a chance on their own. Then again, I have yet to try their carne-asada burrito... which I'm sure is great for the late-night student. But if I'm in the area, I'd personally go to Iguanas for their burrito.", "Date": "2014-07-05", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Nancy N.", "ReviewID": "OBaWunCJCKAoT1aKJcg82Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I come here often, for years!

I have been a regular at this location for quite some time. Location: it is at a very convenient location if you live around SJSU. Parking can be troublesome and depending on what time you go, can be near impossible. Also, the area can be \"dangerous\" at late hours of the night (after midnight) and there are usually homeless people asking for money.Customer service: I truly believe they have improved their customer service over the year. A lot of the ladies working used to give a lot of attitude, but hardly at all now. They're always making sure the tables are clean and there's almost always someone cleaning, depending on how busy it is.Food Quality: this place is known for the Orange Sauce. And sometimes it is very good, and sometimes it tastes like it's very old! It's hit or miss. The burritos, tacos and quesadillas are very good. Combine it with the sauce and you have yourself a pretty epic meal. Chips and salsa can be a lot better though; chips taste stale on occasion. Overall, this is a great place to eat and has been very consistent in delivering good food over the past couple years.I recommend getting a super steak California burrito!", "Date": "2014-06-26", "Author_Location": "Discovery Bay, CA"}, {"Author": "Sandy V.", "ReviewID": "CQ2qFWkWxocvkVxCg-epVw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I came for breakfast with my nephew and it was so delicious... i had a breakfast quesadilla that would have fed an army! \u00a0We also ordered some horchata which was very refreshing and delicious.", "Date": "2014-07-16", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Jomel E.", "ReviewID": "XSRHyh9tkbkNtyTaLqpJSQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "La Vic's is an average taqueria at best. I give this place three stars only because it satisfied my burrito cravings during the years I spent at SJSU. It's conveniently located next to the university and next to other food options in case you can't make up your mind. While La Vic's is open late, I suggest going only during the day time or with a group of people if your late night cravings get the best of you. Downtown SJ is sketch at night with bums and thugs walking around so do be careful.The burritos are good but the carne asada fries suck terribly. The fries are drenched with some kinda cheese sauce that makes the fries become soggy with the quickness. Pouring gallons of orange sauce won't do you any good either. While we're on the topic of orange sauce, I must admit the orange sauce isn't what it used to be compared to how it was during my early years at SJSU. If you're looking for a taqueria with excellent food and a GREEN SAUCE that is way better than orange sauce, I highly suggest going to Santa Fe Taqueria on White Rd in SJ.

When you try to show that place to your friends and family, they don't really get it, but you insist on dragging them back here every time you're back in town.Well, for my boyfriend, this is the place, and I've now been here on a few separate occasions to quench the debauchery in our guts before ditching town. We split a super burrito, wet, with carne asada, which is pretty much my standard order at any Mexican restaurant. Price-wise, and portion-wise, they are comparable to any other taqueria.We ordered the guacamole on the side, because I love it and he hates it, and they almost forgot it, and then served it in a tiny plastic cup. I didn't complain, but I did think to myself that this was probably not equal to the portion of guacamole they would have put inside of the burrito. Still, it was alright, and it was enough for my half.What makes the burrito here, um, different from anywhere else, is that the whole thing is either deep fried or pan fried in butter, then topped with red sauce, then entirely encased in mozzarella cheese, and nuked. So realistically, we're talking Mexican/American/Italian drunk food. Maybe it is the microwaving, but the red sauce turns to an absolute pile of red grease on the plate. You can literally see more grease bubbles than red sauce. The ingredients inside were okay. The carne asada was good, and everything else is standard cheap-taqueria status, but certainly not authentic by any means. I would have actually preferred to find a better taqueria, but this did the trick and suited my needs for the hungover morning in question. As evidenced by the profile picture for La Vic's (as the locals call it, apparently), they are known for their super-fantastic amazing orange sauce. Not only did I not care for the orange sauce, but I thought it tasted like a knock-off of the orange sauce from a major fast food chain whose name may or may not translate to \"the crazy chicken.\"The horchata was pretty good. There was enough sediment for me to suspect that it was instant, but then I also noticed that there was about twice as much cinnamon this time as there was last time, so maybe they spice up an instant packet, or maybe it's home-made and not stirred well enough, but still, it's worth trying.In summary, if I were a brand new 17-year-old college student who had just tried Hypnotiq for the first time, I'd totally be like, \"Ermagherd, La Vic's is so amazing! You have to try it! Let's go RIGHT NOW!\" As an adult who would get sick after eating an entire candy bar, I would prefer food with a grease content of less than eighty percent.", "Date": "2014-06-09", "Author_Location": "Folsom, CA"}, {"Author": "Sam P.", "ReviewID": "DKW6Y27VJdOAWwl0Zk5jDw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"I'll have an order of orange sauce with a burrito on the side.

I love the al pastor here now! And I guess they also added grilled chicken to their menus now. That was the main reason I used to go to iguanas for. If you are eating in, go for the al pastor Quesadilla. You don't want to get these to go because they roll it up and its more like a very cheese burrito. And it won't be as crunchy!

Very bad customer service and super rude attitude even when I was being polite. I ordered a super quesadilla with no guacamole or sour cream, but since the lady was In a hurry and I guess she decided to use selective hearing, she did not take my order accurately.First, the cashier charged it as a burrito but she was able to fix it up. I should have known that if they messed up once, I probably should have taken this as a sign and reiterated myself a couple of time. Obviously, I know what I ordered so when I went to claim my order, I asked to make sure that the order did not have guacamole or salsa. Sure enough, they added salsa and I calmly explained the situation and politely asked if it could be fixed. The lady behind the counter then goes on to giving me bad attitude and rudely reasoned out that it was \"already made\" and that there was no way for it to be replaced since it was already made. Ha. If they aren't able to replace it, at least make an apology. I was about to leave but then a friend suggested to try to get a refund. I tried to get a refund from the cashier but all the employees were giving me an attitude. The new \u00a0cashier was young and sassy and rudely proceeded to backing up her coworker by telling me that she heard me order only no guacamole and no mention of salsa even if during the time that my order was being taken, she was preoccupied packing sauces and dealing with other customers. I'm not sure if its because everyone was having a bad day or they have difficulties maintaining professionalism in the food industry thereby making the employees too stubborn to admit their mistakes. Who knows, maybe it's because I am not of Spanish descent that they felt compelled to treat me so rudely and regard me as less than a values customer. Whatever the reason, It's one thing to not have the order remade or refunded. And it's just salsa so its not a big deal. The point of this review is that it was really rude and extremely appalling that even if the customer's order was messed up by the employees, the employees tried to turn their mistakes back onto the customer and offered rude service and bad attitude instead of an apology.The concept that \"The customer Is always right\" is a pretty universally thing and the fact that they chose to be rude, sassy and have bad attitude instead of treating the customer with respect goes to show how much this establishment should change how their employees handle situations and maybe even retrain their employees on how to treat people.", "Date": "2014-05-16", "Author_Location": "Vallejo, CA"}, {"Author": "Gina L.", "ReviewID": "609jn8kWeGJanmH0XsdQJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great late night food.

I've dined here plenty of times since attending college at SJSU and its safe to say this place is definitely overrated. Based on my experiences at other Mexican joints, the quality of their food is decent at best. It probably isn't fair to compare La Vics to the taquerias in SF Mission Blvd...but Jalisco Taqueria is already another location in SJ that is clearly better than La Vics that I can name. The only thing that keeps customers coming back is their orange sauce to be honest. Everyone drowns their food in this sauce before taking a bite. I am not exaggerating one bit..The sauce is even bought to be taken home and used on other random foods. What i am trying to get at is that La Vics would not be where it is without its infamous sauce that keeps customers coming back for more including myself. My usual go-to items range from the carne asada quesadilla, breakfast burrito, or nacho fries. One thing that i have always noticed is how greasy the quesadillas are. The breakfast burritos (I usually get mine with ham) can be a hit or miss from time to time. Sometimes the beans they use for their breakfast burritos are just damn right cold and mushy which just kills it for me. Overall, La Vic's food is nothing special but it is cheap.

I've been here multiple times and I usually take my visiting friends here since they hear so much about it. My honest opinion, the only things that stands out about La Vic's is their Orange Sauce. I must admit I've only ever had their burrito and super flower quesadilla; out of the two I would recommend the super flour quesadilla. Their Burrito is pretty standard but their quesadilla has a nice flaky outside that's fried, grilled or whatever they do to it to perfection. Although it's bursting with flavor already, I drown every bite in sauce, but that's just me trying to get my moneys worth in orange sauce. If you want to take a bottle of orange sauce home to put on everything, it'll cost you $6 a bottle. I'm not sure what's actually in the sauce but its vegan. I swear sometimes its spicy and sometimes it's not, but try it for yourself.

But please read on to understand why I gave La Victoria Taqueria a 1. I arrived around 8pm on a Saturday night. The \"restaurant\" basically looks like a frat house, which is kind of cool, but it meant that it would be packed inside. The line was all the way to the door, and the wait was about 20 minutes. They had someone take orders as we waited in line, which was nice and helped get the line going. It would also be helpful for them to put a sign that said you need the key to go to the restroom. I literally waited outside the restroom for 10 minutes..thinking someone was inside. I even knocked on the restroom door, but it was so loud that I couldn't hear if someone was in there. The restroom was also a MESS. No toilet paper or paper towels..And paper towels all over the floor. I ordered a chicken burrito, and for the price it was reasonable. Now down to the food itself, I come from Socal so I eat a good deal of Mexican food. I thought this was mediocre and frankly did not find it amazing as I thought it would be. The orange sauce was okay to me, which was disappointing because that is what everyone raves about. The burrito was a tad spicy for me too. Now the main reason I gave this place 1 star is as I was eating my burrito, I bit into what I though was a piece of chicken..a really hard un-bitable piece. But as I pulled it out of the burrito, it happened to be a BROWN PAPER TOWEL IN MY BURRITO..Totally ruined my appetite I'll say. I would have gone back to tell the restaurant but I already left and didn't want to wait in that long line again. I included a photo on Yelp of the paper that I found in my burrito. I am quite an understanding person, and accidents happen. But I couldn't imagine if I began to swallow this paper and could have choked on it. I am hoping someone from La Vic's will see this review, and make their burritos a little more cautiously next time.

Mind = Blown. I've eaten at La Vic's since high school, probably some time in 2005. If the other reviews didn't tip you off, it is known for its orange sauce. This sauce has an amazingly unique taste and it goes well with so many things. Buy a bottle for yourself and try it on all kinds of food and you will see that it goes well with EVERYTHING. Sushi, hot dogs, fast food, meat, whatever. If I were vegan I could happily eat brocolli and tofu with orange sauce for days. (Days before I realized the error of my ways and switched back to eating meat, that is)Back in high school I looked at Yelp threads and random message boards where everyone was trying to guess what exactly was in the famous orange sauce. People who claimed they worked at La Vic's said the hidden ingredient was lard/pork grease. Well looks like these internet trolls had us all for fools. I dunno what the hell's in the sauce or how it's vegan, but just know that it is delicious AND the only reason to go here.This place is open late, and is a go-to spot for downtown SJ drunkees after a concert or game at HP pavilion or a night out at any of our fine Asian/Mexican dominant, sausage-fest bars and clubs. As for the food: Their tacos are bland. Their meats are bland. Their Al Pastor is especially bad. Saltier than the Dead Sea, I kid you not. Their burritos often have very uneven distribution so you will end up taking bites of just rice and beans. The one item I like here is the super quesadilla. Unlike quesadillas at most taquerias, it's wrapped more like a flat burrito. I dunno how to explain what it looks like, but it's good (and often very messy).With my dislike for the food, you would think I would give this place a low rating, and yet I am giving this place 4 stars. I would rate this as a 2 star taqueria. The sauce alone gives this place 2 extra stars. \u00a0If I want a real good burrito or quesadilla, there are a lot of places I consider better than La Vic's. There is a reason why so many taquerias in San Jose have tried to create their own orange sauce though.

So if you haven't tried this place, I suggest you to turn around and make a left at the corner and walk down to Iguana's... It was way too spicy. So spicy that I couldn't even taste the beauty of the orange sauce. I was too busy saying ah ah ah in my mouth. I ordered the nacho fries but where was the nacho cheese? At Iguana's the nacho fries is smoothered in cheese. Here I barely had any cheese...so I was disappointed. Also the quesadilla was way too thin and not enough goodies inside. The burrtio was okay though. I had the buche burrito and it was spicy as well. Everything I ordered I did not ask for spicy but it came spicy. Is everything spicy by default? Or they just happened to make mine hella spicy.... Anyways, I couldn't finish anything. I didn't even take a bite of my burrito until I got home. When I'm at Iguana's I always finish all the fries, all the quesadilla, and at least half of the burrito. Here at La Vic's I was struggling....struggling to finish my food...the struggle was real.... I almost crashed too cuz parking in downtown is such a bitch. If I did crash, was it worth it?? Hell no!!! Cuz it wasn't even that good... Maybe it would have been good if I never eaten at Iguana's. But because I have, I have no choice but to compare them and say Iguana's is the winner here. Lots of college students eating here made it look so fun to be a student at SJSU. It must be so cool to have so many places nearby your school to go eat during breaks and lunches. Man if I went to SJSU I would go to Iguana's every single day....their fries are thinner. La Vic's has thicker fries. But Iguana's they smoother it in cheese. I probably won't ever come back here. Why come eat here when you have Iguana's right around the corner???? This place closes at 12am and 3am depending what day it is and so does Iguana's. Oh the competition.... This place has more reviews though. Was it opened first? Iguana has over 1000 which is A LOT but La Vic's has twice as much. But the food ain't as good!!! Maybe people haven't heard of Iguana's.

Oh well, that orange sauce is a freakin' drug so I keep comin' back. I buy it by the bottle for $6 and put on sandwiches, eggs, pasta, chips, oven pizzas, and just about everything whenever I eat on the cheap at home.It can make $1 microwavable burrito somewhat edible when you are broke. So feel free to invest in a bottle of that sauce. And it won't make you sick as long as you do not put it on their food.I tend to prefer to the Santa Clara location to the one on San Carlos.

The beef was either overcooked or they used poor quality meat because it lacked both texture and flavor. It's kind of hard to describe, but the carne asada had the same consistency as corned beef? I don't know. All I know is that I did not like it.And as for their orange sauce...it's no mystery folks. It's just a sauce made from a whole lot of butter or lard and that's why people love it so much. It's greasy, disgusting, and people just love that fatty stuff! I liked the fact that there was a very strong garlic flavor in the sauce, but other than that...I would like to keep my waistline slim, so I think I'll pass!

I have never been to this spot before midnight so this review is strictly for the late night experience, at which point they supposedly get the most traffic.Most of the food at La Vic's is moderately good. Their secret orange sauce is very good, yes, but to me, the sauce is a simple, spicy chili-based chutney. My picks are the Super Burrito with chicken is pretty stellar and the nachos with -- choice of meat, salsa, sour cream, beans, guacamole; absolutely stupendous. That said, the sauce does make the meal significantly better than other Taqueria experiences. Even with the large volume of activity the place gets, the service is prompt and managed very well. I have never had any issues whatsoever with my order. \u00a0That is a very big plus.Forewarning to those that have an issue with noise.

Thirdly, the salsa is mediocre in the quesadilla, so I always leave it out.\"regular corn quesadilla, no salsa\". \u00a0that's how I order it. \u00a0The nice crunchy edges and freshly melted cheese really tops off a tough day of midterms or work. \u00a0I don't like the flour quesadillas because it feels too dry and floury. \u00a0It kind of takes away from the cheesiness, no pun intended.Veggie Burrito: Don't order this. Instead, get what I get. \u00a0For years, I have ordered this standing order and conditioned the staff to gradually get better at understanding it. \u00a0So thanks to me, you can order this too and they'll know what you're talking about. \u00a0I remember the first 5 months. \u00a0I kept getting perplexed facial expressions. \u00a0anyway, order this \"Hi. I'll have a regular burrito with only rice, beans, cheese, and sour creme. Nothing else. NO MEAT\" \u00a0You have to stress \"no meat\" at the end. \u00a0That's to satisfy a checklist in their head.They'll ask you what kind of beans so say, \"REFRIED\". \u00a0That's the optimal combination for a killer burrito.The salsa and guacamole are just par, so I leave them out in ALL orders. \u00a0From how the food is structured, lettuce seems to only make the burritos worse.If you really need meat, I hear craves mostly for either the chicken or steak burrito. \u00a0When you order these, just go for the traditional with no salsa or guacamole. \u00a0Just rice, beans, cheese, sour creme, and meat. \u00a0That's probably the best combination out there.The enchilada entrees are pretty good. \u00a0They look delicious when they come out. There is an entire layer of melted cheese and it looks thick and delicious. \u00a0But once you bite into the enchiladas there... the flavors are kind of lacking. \u00a0It's not as power-packed in flavor as it looks. \u00a0You'll most likely need the orange sauce to help out, but I tried and it doesn't go well with it. \u00a0Nachos: \u00a0If you want a big quantity, order this to-go. \u00a0You get more bang for your buck. \u00a0Same with ordering chips n salsa... get that to-go. \u00a0Anyway, the nachos use the cheap melted artificial sauce. \u00a0The chips they use are standard tortilla chips. \u00a0I prefer the freshly made ones that some taquerias have... it tastes freshly baked or deep fried. The nachos are very filling and dangerously unhealthy. \u00a0The artificial cheese, sour cream, meat, etc. \u00a0Careful on this one! \u00a0Flavorwise... I'm not too crazy about it. \u00a0The messy fingers isn't worth it for this dish. \u00a0I'd rather go with my favorite quesadillas and burritos for a more satisfying fill.The orange sauce can be really spicey at times if they're not careful when they make it. \u00a0In fact, the spiciness has increased over the last 2 years. \u00a0If you want an alternate, use the green sauce. \u00a0It is actually pretty good. \u00a0It goes well with the quesadillas at best. \u00a0Orange sauce will go best with the burritos and quesadillas.Chips and SalsA: \u00a0You need to come with enough experience to tell if their chips are stale or not. \u00a0Because they want to be speedy, they bag chips already for those who wish to order to-go. \u00a0And so, these open paper bags of chips just sit there for a while and can go hard.The busy hours of this place have been extended and it's hard to predict quiet hours nowadays. \u00a0The place is too popular! \u00a0However, for good food and great prices, it's worth the trip and slight wait in line.", "Date": "2006-12-05", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Sean M.", "ReviewID": "LEETuQxkX8KNph61NBZ2Rw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't believe the overall review of this place is so low.

Because lets face it, any extra cash I had went to alcohol. I know I am not alone on that one. My favorite item on the menu to this day, which is also probably the only thing I order, is the super quesadilla - with carne asada.

I have to admit that my review is slightly biased based on the fact that I hail from Ohio, and lets face it folks, even semi-authentic Mexican food just doesn't exist there. That being said, La Vic's will always hold a special place in my heart. However, after living in California for five years now, and having the opportunity to explore many more (and more delicious, may I add) Mexican food joints, La Vic's has definitely downgraded in stars. (I would have initially given it all five). So, without further ado, I give you the pluses and minuses of this infamous Taqueria:Pluses:+I know everyone has already raved about it, but the orange sauce is really the only reason I continue to come back. I swear it is laced with crack or some other addictive substance. That or it consists primarily of lard. Awesome.+You can buy the orange sauce by the bottle. It tastes good on ANYTHING. trust me.+They have delicious strawberry drink (fresas), most likely made with 99% with pure sugar, 1% strawberry chunks = 100% pure delciousness.+It's one of the few places that is open late that isn't Jack-in-the-Gross.+Like I said before, it holds a special place in my heartMinuses:+It's loud and almost always crowded. I guess when you're drunk it doesn't matter+The food is less than stellar -- I have been noticing lately that the burritos / tacos consist of extremely watery meat and by the time you're halfway through, your food is a soggy mess =( \u00a0If you want delicious semi-cheap mexican food, go to Iguana's, right around the corner. Really you should only come here for the sauce.+If you do come late and you're not intoxicated, be prepared to be surrounded by drunken idiots.

I LOVE la vics!It took me awhile to actually go here even though I've heard so much about it. Even my little sister went here before i did O_O.I told her to order me whatever she liked the most cos she frequented this taqueria ~1 a week (during the peak of her addiction) and she ordered me the super flour quesadilla with carne asada. I remember I squished the twinkle in her eye when I told her that it was \"alright\" and that I liked it but I didn't understand why she would come here ALL THE TIME for this. It didn't leave me craving for more..Fast forward a few weeks later and I came back with my cousin and she told me she liked the burritos here. This is where I met my La Vics soulmate: Super Burrito, NO BEANS with carne asada. It was soooo good.

After a quick walk we got in line. The line moved pretty quickly and I settled on a chicken and beef taco.That's when the real wait began. It was the lunch hour rush and this place gets *packed* for that famous orange sauce. First the good... because we had to wait so long for our food, we scored a table by the window. I like that there is a communal table down the middle of the place. When we finally got our food, the tacos were fairly tasty. The beef taco was much better, the chicken was a little weird and stringy, with a red sauce that didn't taste bad but took a moment to introduce to my palette. The orange sauce was nice, but nothing to induce the fanboy reaction I've read in other reviews. Quick tip: I think you can buy bottles of the stuff to go.The bad: 30 minutes to wait for Mexican food?? What's going on back there, preparing the secret mole sauce? I know it's a rush, but optimize that sh**. The cheese for nachos is some weird orange velveta stuff pumped from a movie theatre cheese dispenser which totally weirded out my friend. As much as I like communal tables it messes up the flow of ordering and picking up food.There were some other oddities.

I didn't like La Victoria back then and I definitely wasn't impressed this second time around :(I ordered the carne asada burrito. Carne asada, rice, salsa and cheese--pretty hard to mess up, right? There wasn't anything terribly wrong with it, but the carne asada lacked so much flavor! I always make the argument that LA/SoCal Mexican food is far superior because all the meat is cooked in lard (though this may be disputable). Meat up north is probably not cooked in the delicious fattiness of lard because it is seriously so bland and tasteless. The rice also lacked flavor and there were barely any tomatoes. So yeah, the sauce is going to be amazing because you absolutely need it to wash down the burrito. It's basically glorified chipotle mayo...The one plus side is the price; it cost $5.62 for my burrito after tax. Service was slow, but the workers were friendly.

However, last night, I found myself in San Jose and we ate here for dinner. This was my first time at La Vic's, period.Being that it's right near San Jose State, there was a bunch of college students eating here. My friends and I were probably the oldest in the small restaurant. But we blended right in. Gotta love being Asian and looking forever young. (ha!)I wasn't hungry enough for a burrito and decided to go for a few tacos. Usually 3 will suffice, or if I'm starving, then I'll get 4. I originally wanted 3 tacos de cabeza. I didn't see cabeza on the menu but decided to ask the chick anyway. She looked a little surprised but pleased to hear me ask for the meat and politely apologized that they didn't offer that meat. I went with 3 tacos de carne asada instead. My order was ready and when I went to the counter to get my food, I nearly had a cow. I did not expect the tacos to be that big! When I first saw the menu, I was a little put off by the price of each taco because it was expensive. However, once I received the tacos, I could see why.Overall, my tacos were good. They were loaded with meat, pinto beans, and fresh pico de gallo. I was taken back by the pinto beans, only because they traditionally aren't served in classic tacos, but they tasted good. My tacos were filling and I could only eat 2 of the 3. I ended up wrapping up my extra taco and giving it to a homeless guy down the block. I did try a bit of their notorious orange sauce and it was pretty tasty. But my tacos were good as is, so I didn't have much of the sauce other than to try it. If I return, then I would definitely try a burrito next time as I'm sure it compliments the sauce nicely.", "Date": "2010-11-15", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Thuy Tien L.", "ReviewID": "p23bqOfVusUwbsWJNemj0g", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I went in search of food today during a lunch break from MCAT studying and stumbled upon this place.

Guess not.The carne asada burrito I had was quite good, definitely better than anything I ever had outside of California. The meat was well-seasoned and flavorful and actually separated when I bit into it. Don't you hate when you bite into a chunk of meat but all that happens is that the entire thing comes out, leaving a gaping, meatless hole in the burrito? I do. The size of the regular burrito is reminiscent of the \"big ass burrito\" that I sometimes ate in England, once again reminding me of why Americans are so much fatter than everyone else in the world. I'm scared to think what the super burrito might look like.

I ordered a Super quesadilla with chicken for my 'late night snack.' As i was about to eat my food, I realized how watery the filling inside my quesdilla was and decided to drain it out before actually eating it. The tortilla was cooked to perfection. I love La Vic's quesdillas because of their soft yet crunchy tortilla that they use for the quesadilla. I finished my quesadilla pretty quickly and washed down my meal with a nice Pineapple jarritos. Great service and food. Most likely come back since my boyfriend loves this place. :PPS: The salsa is very watery!

It's just such a familiar place.Another advantage of its familiarity, is that LaVics can always be the \"plan b\" place to eat. Everone knows and loves LaVics. Can't think of where to eat? LaVics. What is open right now? LaVics. Wanna grab something quick before the party? LaVics.This place almosts defines my college diet, especially during my earlier years. During my first few months SJSU, I swear I would bleed orange sauce out of my nose. What is funny though is the Orange Sauce security. That guy feels up your brown bag to check if you stole any bottles of sauce. It is the mose amusing thing when you see him actually catch someone.\"Hold on playa playa... you gots ta leave that here!\"And also right when your done eating, or appear that you have already finished up your meal, one of the ladies comes by, swoops up the orange sauce, and secures it back at the counter. Anyway, I don't need to really persuade anyone to go to LaVics because if you live near downtown or are a SJSU student, you wouldn't be able to avoid it anyway.", "Date": "2011-08-03", "Author_Location": "San Ramon, CA"}, {"Author": "Phi T.", "ReviewID": "Md32Reg_AKTVbLDDKyUujg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "La Vics ORANGE SAUCE is the freebase form of cocaine that can be ingested; it is the most addictive form of taco, quesadilla, burrito, and nacho sauce.

I really love the enchiladas here (carne asada being the meat of choice) since they don't drown it in enchilada sauce. It's just cheese, tortilla, and meat or cheese again. Their carne asada is pretty good, the rest of the meat selection though IMO is just average. That includes carnitas, chicken, al pastor, chorizo, lingua, etc.As for drinks, they have pretty good watermelon/strawberry/strawberry-mango/jamaica frescas. The horchata here though has too much cinnamon for my taste.Another plus about this place is that it's open til 3 am (used to be 2 am, then they petitioned the city to allow them to stay open an hour later to accommodate all the clubbing crowd).

AHHH!Well to start off, my first time @ La Vic's I was starting this thing about being a vegetarian.. it didn't last long. 2nd time was a totally awesome experience. I came here with a friend back in summer '09. It was delicious and dancing in my mouth! Their sauce is pretty good. It changed throughout the past few years. It was less cheesy and yellow orange. It's seems like they added more cheese & mayonnaise. When i originally had their orange sauce was better. But I'm guessing they had to change their sauce to grab more customers. There's always a comparison between Iguana's & La Vic's. Always a constant battle since they're also on the same block. The difference I would say is the designs, presentation, orange sauce & not all meats are served. Lengua isn't served at Iguana's. That's one of my favorite types of meats to eat in Mexican food. One thing about La Vic's I really don't like, is their nachos. Their nachos are on some cheap-ass chips. And when you get their nachos with everything, these chips get soggy within the next 2-5 min of sitting there... And that's something I don't want to be eating. Cold soggy nachos... ewww. Not to boast or anything, but Iguana's chips used in the nacho's are hand-made and stay crunchy. But of course it gets soggy later later. Like 30 min later. Anywho, La Vic's you're still a grade B in my book. I still come here now and then but of course not all the time. Still good to grab fries & a lengua burrito :)", "Date": "2012-03-30", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Erin H.", "ReviewID": "3m7NjVvIIr8T54nV3LG_Dg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't know what's so addicting about the infamous orange sauce. It's definitely got a spicy kick to it, but from what I heard, one of the secret ingredient is chorizo grease? Heart-stopping. Maybe because I was a first timer, I'm not accustomed to the frequent consumption of the orange sauce, to the point I develop an addiction. Came to SJSU for a meeting and met with a friend whom I haven't seen for 6 years. It was around dinner time and I was coming out of my meeting all famished. My friend and I went down the street where La Vic's and many other surrounding eateries are located. Perfect place for hungry college students not too far from campus. After hearing about the orange sauce, I had to see it for myself. I've lived in San Diego during my undergraduate years, so I've had my fair share of bomb Mexican food. To start off, we both ordered super burritos. I got mine with al pastor with no rice, easy on the cheese and sour cream (typical Socal-style). The burritos were indeed huge, even without the rice. Few bites in, there was so much oozy sauce and grease from the al pastor. The amount of veggies were very minimal, and the al pastor... didn't taste anything like I've had in the past. It was very saucy and grease started to drip out of the ass crack of my burrito. Along with the beans, it was like eating a bowl of chili. I then picked up the bottle of the orange sauce, put in a few squirt, \"eh, it's aite\". I'll stick to my San Diegan roots with their freshly made salsa.Good drunk food. If you're the type that loves their burrito on a messy and greasy side, this is your stop. Top it off with orange sauce, your arteries will forever hate you.

Also, the super nachos are $8.65 and the regular nachos are something like $4 - but the regular nachos are just jalapenos and the afore-mentioned \"cheese\" (that orange liquid really isn't cheese).

I had been here several times before and the food always seemed rather average to me, and this time around didn't change my mind much.I ordered a super burrito with carne asada - the staple meat of Mexican cuisine. The burrito itself isn't anything spectacular; the tortilla was overcooked, so soft to the point that it got soggy from the juices inside the burrito. It also wasn't wrapped tightly enough, so my burrito ended up falling apart about halfway through. The carne asada itself is very juicy and full of flavor and is probably the best component of the burrito. Beans are about average, while the rice was also overcooked and very mushy. The \"orange sauce\" is what most people rave on and on about. Personally, I thought it was amazing the first time I had it, but after the second or third time it really doesn't seem that special. It has a tangy, cheesy taste to it with just a little bit of kick. It's not bad, but it's not the best thing ever, either. I prefer standard hot sauce over their \"orange sauce\". If you like to go out for Japanese food and order massive rolls filled with deep fried stuff and drenched in sauce thinking that it's \"sushi\" (by the way, it isn't sushi, so stop calling it that), then you'll probably love the orange sauce at La Vic's. I'm more of an old-fashioned, authentic, tried-and-true person, so I'm not a big fan.\"La Victoria\" is a fitting name for this joint, as it's literally a Victorian-esque house. I'm not sure if it used to be a residence prior to becoming a taqueria, but the place looks like it's been around for quite some years. \u00a0Parking is a pain; there's a Jack in the Box as well as a McDonald's nearby that you can park at, although their lots are not exactly spacious. Other than that, you can park on the street (which is metered) or in a lot (something like $1.50 per half hour). On the plus side, it's open very late. Keep in mind that this is downtown that we're talking about, right around the corner from SJSU, so you're likely to run into a lot of college students and the occasional drunkard or two from one of the nearby clubs.Overall, La Victoria (or \"La Vic's\", as their fans affectionately call it) isn't a bad place to grab a bite to eat, but it's nothing spectacular.

I know that even I find myself craving for it in the middle of the night (no thanks to their orange sauce). But it really is just pretty average Mexican Taqueria food. There are a lot of other taquerias in the greater San Jose area that have better food and perks like all-you-can-eat chips and salsa. Nonetheless, La Vics is still worth trying.Food:Bit on the greasy side, as it should be. I'm a sucker for carnitas burritos when it comes to Mexican food and theirs does not disappoint. Bits of it are on the crispier side which I love. The spanish rice is always good as well. Never too dry and never too moist. Carne Asada is pretty standard. Not my favorite meat to get just because of the blandness of the meat. Needless to say, the orange sauce is why you have to come try this place. If they're selling bottles of it on the daily and they're constantly worried about you stealing the restaurant's ones, they must be doing something right with it. I've opened fridges of friends up in Davis and Sacramento and they have a bottle that they bought all the way down in San Jose. If that doesn't scream delicious, I really don't know what else to say. Like I said though, based on the food alone, La Vics is pretty standard when it comes to their food. The use of the sauces makes everything better, but it really covers up the real taste of the food. Restaurant:Downtown San Jose by SJSU is a small restaurant with a second floor that they sometimes do no open. It's worth going to this location because this is the original La Vics. There's another La Vics a few blocks down that was recently renovated and it's on Santa Clara Street. Typically this one on the weekend gets packed when bars/clubs close so if you got to get your fix in at 2am. I would suggest the one closer to SJSU. The third location is off Almaden Expressway in South San Jose (close to the Brittania Arms). This location is relatively still new too (only about 5 years?) so the restaurant is really clean. Typically the wait is never too long at this one and if you had to choose a location to go to, I would suggest this one because there is ample parking and it's located right by 87 and 85. Tips:If you order to-go, get a lot of takeout orange sauces. It's free, why not?!Know what you want to order by the time you get up to the front. They're not too pleasant if you aren't ready.

My quesadilla was deep fried and leaky =/ With every bite I took, there were juices flowing out the other end. By the time I was finished with one half, there was a puddle of sauce on my plate. The orange sauce was ok, it made my mediocre quesadilla taste a little bit better. My cousin complained her burrito was very dry, especially the meat. The chips were stale-ish & the guacamole was d-i-s-g-u-s-t-i-n-g. I'm pretty sure this stuff was store bought because it definitely wasn't fresh. It was spicy, bland, and pureed, with no texture whatsoever. I like my guacamole on the chunky side. I'd say this place was...alright. The orange sauce is overrated but was definitely better than the food. I live in SF and I would say that La Vic's isn't worth the drive.

Years ago as a Sophmore at SJSU, I thought, \"Maybe I need a break from Iguana's and see what's so special here.\" During my break period in between classes, I came to La Vic's and ordered a Carnitas Burrito. I remember seeing the employees giggling and laughing while looking at me. I didn't think much of it. When my order came up, I saw an employee dumping in tablespoon packages of orange sauce in my to-go bag. I was completely confused. I asked her for the green sauce (saw it in the fridge) and she said, \"Yeah, here.\" So, I went to my car and ate it and poured the sauce and ate. Towards the bottom of the burrito I found weird bits of hard pieces that seemed like bones? I was pissed off and swore that I'll never eat here again. I don't know why I still go here. It's... too... addicting...Their Super Burritos are a bit above mediocre, but for the price and size, it's worth it. I normally have the Torta or Super Quesadilla. I love the Torta because they add avocado and beans!! I love the Super Quesadilla because the tortilla has a nice buttery, crispy-ness. They're both a smaller, cheaper version of the Super Burrito which is worth it if you have a small stomach. I tend not to get the (Super) Tacos because there's no point. For a dollar-ish extra you can get the items I've mentioned above and it would be double the portion of one taco.The Orange Sauce is too good to be true. Good chipotle heat with a bit of garlic and sour cream (or Mexican crema?). Every once in a while it tastes a bit different, BUT IT'S STILL SO FREAKING GOOD. But if I buy a bottle of it, I can't eat it with anything else because fries or other burritos I've paired it with neutralize something in the sauce so you can barely taste it. I think it's made to be eaten with La Vic's food. It makes me sad.

I ordered their carne asada super burrito with a bottle of the orange sauce. The burrito was sub-par - the meat was flavorless and dry. The rice was terribly soggy and flavorless as well. There really wasn't anything in the burrito I liked. The only flavor in this burrito was the orange sauce and that was average at best.There are countless burrito shacks that put this place to disgrace. As previously stated, this place can't even compete against any decent hole in the wall burrito shack from Berkeley or San Francisco. One place that comes into mind, is the small burrito shack on 19th and Franklin in Oakland. Their green sauce is 10x better than the orange sauce and they have the best carnitas I have tasted in the bay area. Too bad I can't find their name anywhere.

I am a fan of La Vics. I know it doesn't have the highest quality meat, the best service or pleasant environment. But I love it anyway, let me count the ways...1. Quesadillas - These are the most amazing quesadilla's in SC County. They use a bit of grease and crisp the outside so it's ridiculously crispy on the outside, full of delightful Mexicana in the center. The burritos will fill you gut, these will fill your culinary soul.2. Nachos - This massive insane plate of awesome may have come from taqueria, but it's 100% pure American. At first, I was going to frown upon La Victoria for using hard premade chips, until I realized you have to have them to eat the nachos. There is just too much awesome on the plate for standard tortilla chips to handle. Choice meat, salsa, beans sour cream, guac and cheese \"whiz\"? Hear that? That is victory in your mouth.3. Burritos - Want portable food? The burrito is your thing. They are pretty hefty, and filled all the nacho stuff, but rice instead of cheese whiz and chips. I love these dearly, especially after 6 beers.4. Meats - Great selection, not highest quality, but certainly above average. Here is my top 5:  \u00a0 Carnitas 1 (when it's fresh it's only beaten by the mighty Muchos) \u00a0 Al Pastor (so greasy and spicy you barely need sauce) \u00a0 Carne Asada  \u00a0 Carnitas 2 (when it's not so fresh it's still good) \u00a0 BucheSide note, their pollo is not that good. I think chicken is the worst of Mexican meats in general, but theirs is definately the worst option.So that's about it. You like quick, greasy Mexican that's above average in prices and quality?

There is not a lot of parking out front however in general there is a lot of parking in the area. No Music, however I would guess to hear hip-hop or a local radio station because of its location and there general clientele are clubbers, bar hoppers and college kids. Service:Like any other Taqueria, however sometimes the servers/help are impatient, but they are helpful. They are very conservative of their \" Orange Sauce\" they will come to your table and take the bottle if your finishing up your food before your even done or the bottle is empty. However they do keep the place clean. \u00a0They also have night security which is a big plus in my book because all the college/ clubbers drunks will be handled if necessary.I have also seen the security guard stop someone from stealing the orange sauce. \u00a0Food/Taste:as of 1/12/09Soft tacos are delicious, the steak/meat is very savory, while the toppings are a nice mix. The Burritos are ok, they have gone down hill since my freshmen year. Recently I went and the Carnesada(steak) burrito was mediocre \u00a0if not terrible. The steak was over cooked if not burnt; I say this because of the steak was dry and crunchy. The other toppings/fillings are good however very cheap with the sour cream and guacamole.

So I'd like to think I'm somewhat of a expert in this type of food. I was first introduced to La Victoria through a friend who swears that this is the best Taqueria in the bay area, and that their orange salsa is exceptional. Being the foodie that I am, I went and ordered their chicken burrito. My impression of the place at first sight was good. It's small with limited seating and had a pretty long line and all the tables were filled. This I thought was gonna be a great burrito. In my experience the small, hole in the wall joints have the best food. I was very excited to dig into my burrito. I drenched the first bite in their orange salsa and dug in. The first bite was good. The chicken was moist, and it was seasoned well. The extras in it were ample, not too much, not too little, and yes, the orange salsa was delish. All in all it was a good burrito. Not great, not horrible, just...good. I would disagree with my friend that they have the best burritos in the bay. I have had better. I would say that the best part of the burrito was the orange salsa. The next time I ate there was after a night of debauchery and drinking and the food tasted much better. Now this could be due to the fact that I was drunk and I think at that point a deep fried boot would have been tasty to me. So consider the state I was in to really fairly judge their food. The next time I went there (and the last) I got sick. Two bites into it and I felt nauseous. I was able to get through half of it, and that was it. About 30 mins later and I was sick. Now, I don't think it was food poisoning, but there was something that just didn't go down well. All in all, it's worth the trip for the orange salsa and perhaps I should try something other than the chicken burrito. Would I eat here again?

In saying that, burritos and other items they have on the menu at this restaurant are less than impressive to other mexican restaurants that I've experienced. Basically I can buy the sauce they got in there and feel like I'm eating La Vics food on anything that I put its sauce on at home.Service is okay. The wait is acceptable since it is in a very busy business area. Also parking is difficult so walking is a wiser method of getting there. I didn't have a bad experience here whatsoever but the taste of the food was hardly desirable.

Everyone has told me such good things about this place and the orange sauce. I so much wanted to try this place out and like it. But I couldn't do it. On a Sunday afternoon after coming back from the Ski Dazzle snowboard convention I didn't know what i wanted to eat. My buddy suggested La Vics, so i was like lets do it. Because the last time I went to La Vics it was the other location and I wasn't that hungry. This time I was very hungry, and wanted to see if the food was good. Well let me start out by saying that the quality of this food is comparable to that of cafeteria food. I believe that's why the students here love this place so much. The carne asada was a joke, very tough and chewy. Burrito was wrapped very sloppy and loose. I would think after wrapping that many burritos you would have it down to perfection. That's not the case here, it was so sloppy i had to pull off so much tortilla to eat my burrito. And that nasty orange sauce people keep talking about. OMG that was some nasty mayo based crap. It tasted like some mayo with sriracha hot sauce and some spicy zesty sauce from taco bell. And if you \"NEED\" the sauce to make the food taste good, then that says it all. YOUR FOOD SUCKS! And as for the service, that too also sucked. It wasn't the workers that made the service suck. It was the management letting two people take orders, prep orders for pickup and clean tables. With all that money they are making at least hire some more staff. I felt sorry for the lady that was giving out orders. She was doing too much. And the line was crazy in that small ass house. Everything was so smoochy.

Here's some reasons why (and they're lucky I'm being generous right now because my friends convinced me to not be an a-hole about it):-I needed to take the largest piss of my life, so I came in here, ordered my burrito, and asked to used the restroom but the lady says it's already closed (WTF, isn't it the law for all sit-in establishments to have a restroom? I just gave you $5! Don't make me piss on the side of your restaurant now...)-Honestly, I would 2-star this spot IF it weren't for the orange sauce because the burrito itself was so damn disappointing that I had to mask it in the sauce. The beans were hard, the it was filled with rice and salsa, and had very little carne asada (which was rubbery by the way)-The cashier lady had a terribly rude attitude. I understand that she's probably serving to college kids, but this was at 10:30pm! The kids that are there aren't even drunk yet! Wait a few hours to get your \"Ms. Thang\" attitude on, lady.-The cashier lady walks over to my table and just pulls my tray away, along with my friends' trays, without even asking. WHAT IF i wasn't done? You're suppose to ask and not just butt in and do as you please...My apologies to this lady if she was honestly having a bad day, but I really did have that much more of a poor experience because of her.The orange sauce though is amazing, and I would probably recommend that you come here just to buy that bottle, take it to your other favorite taqueria, and use it there--there is where you'll find your 5-star burrito!Oh, you'll also probably find a 4-5 star burrito here when you're completely under the influence because if Taco Bell tastes good when you're drunk, this will definitely taste better...", "Date": "2009-05-02", "Author_Location": "Alhambra, CA"}, {"Author": "Stacy S.", "ReviewID": "nHmTmIRsFTaPyP_KQBkcaA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My absolute favorite taqueria ever.

Well I can't say much about the food when I never got a chance to taste it. I will explain.I wanted to say a little about myself before I start my review. I'm the type of person who wouldn't waste my time writing a review unless something is extremely good or extremely bad. \u00a0In this case, unfortunately the experience was horrible. It all happened on 1/28/2012 early in the morning around 12:30-1:00am. \u00a0My friends and I came out of a club early because we decided to grab some grub instead. We decided to walk to La Vics because it was close by and I've heard a great deal about their food. One of my girlfriend's and I ordered together. She ordered a burrito and I ordered a super burrito with extra lettuce and guacamole on the side. After waiting 20 min for our order because the place was extremely crowded, our order came out. We had 2 items wrapped in foil; one bigger item and one smaller item. My friend assumed the bigger one was mine because I ordered a super burrito. Because I was starving, I opened it and took my first bite when I realized it wasn't what I ordered. When she opened hers, she realized it was a large taco instead. Understanding that it was a miscommunication problem we went up to the cashier asking the lady nicely that there was confusion about the order. However instead of being understanding, she gave us attitude saying that she did not make a mistake at all. And saying that she can't fix anything. Because I still wanted my super burrito we asked her if she can give us that and she said that in order to do that, she has to charge us 3 dollars extra. Frustrated already, my friend gave her card to her to charge and started waiting for our orders again. After 20 min of waiting and staring at the cook in the front our orders were still not out. I then went to the cashier again and asked her where our food was. She told me that we decided to CANCEL it. By then we were furious! #1. She can't hear our orders and puts in random shit#2. She charged us more and cancels our food#3. She had a horrible attitude and when we were confronting her about it, she thought it was funny. She was smiling the whole time and thought it was a joke. #4. We were waiting by her the whole time. I know she sees us waiting for the food so why would she just let us stand there for 20 min if it wasn't on purpose. The experience at La Vic's was horrible! I would never go back to that location again. Also when I asked her where her manager was, she just answered me that \"oh, he's around.\" What kind of answer is that? It was ridiculous! Complete waste of my time. My friend being a person that doesn't like confrontation decided to drop it. I thought it was one of the worst customer service places I have ever went to. We ended paying 12 dollars for no food. If I were the manager, I would have fired her a long time ago. \u00a0I also want to add she also messed up on one of my other friend's order in our group. He asked for a super burrito with no beans. Instead he got a regular burrito with extra beans! Moral of the story: Stay away from that chick while you order your food because I don't think she understand what hell she is doing in her job. And when it's crowded, don't expect them to get your food right. \u00a0She was a mexican looking chick about 5'3\" ish with long hair. Possibly working most of the night shifts.

The only reason I can think of why people go here rather then Iguanas (which is wayyy better) is because of the orange sauce (which is also overrated). They probably make their burritos taste shitty just so the sauce taste that much better.2.Service is a POS. They treat their orange sauce like its their only child. Its ridiculous. The staff is not friendly at all. You want a nice/friendly staff that will give you all the sauce you want? Go to Iguanas. I may seem bias, but go there to see for yourself.3. I just came back from La Vics while turning in a paper. I only went there because it was too damn hot to walk to Iganuas and plus they hadn't open yet. Anyways so at La Vic's they have a $6 minimum for credit card. My order came out to $5.5 and I only had $3 dollars on me. So I asked the lady if she could just let it slide this one time. She nodded yes to me. Not sure if she understood me or not, I asked her again and she confirmed. When I got my receipt to sign, it showed $6 and I looked at the lady, and she just had this shady look on her face.

Yeah, how original.Anyway, came here after a fraternity type function and had to drive circles around downtown San Jose because there was no parking anywhere to be found and there is no establishment parking as far as I could tell.

Barely.Having heard about this mystical \"orange sauce\" for months and finally trying it, I can say that it most definitely does not live up to the hype. I ordered the standard plate when you want to judge any taqueria: burritio de asada. Our order took a while because of all the people who had ordered and who wanted to order. (Also, if you come here with a group looking for late night grub, expect to go chair hunting, or just stand) When I finally did get my burrito, I took a bite sans orange sauce... it was bland, tasteless, and just not that good. Disappointed, I poured on some of that secret sauce. You get an awkward tangy taste.

I had a lot of expectations before coming here. A lot of my friends raved about this place but they've only eaten here after a night on the town. \u00a0I have been meaning to come here but somehow cramped quarters filled with drunk people always made me put it off.So I came to La Vics (thats what the cool kids call it) on a Sunday night hoping there was no new Sunday night club that just opened. Luckily, it was just filled with an entire San Jose State dorm. No problem, if the food is good I'll wait. I ended up ordering an al pastor regular taco, super carne asada nachos, and an orchata. The al pastor taco was way too greasy. The consistency of the meat was mushy and undiscernible. Call me a purist but I like my tacos with meat, onions, cilantro, and sauce and thats it. There was an article from The Wave strategically placed right by the register(works every time), which highlighted the nachos. I enjoyed it but nothing to write home about. The round chips they used were stale and not crispy at all, reminding me of something you would buy in bulk. Lastly, I am a big fan of orchata and theirs was too watery and not enough cinnamon.All in all, I can see why the late night crowd enjoys this place. Although the cramped quartes, few tables, and snakelike line seems to beg \u00a0for drunken altercations. \u00a0I think I will come back here one more time to try the quesadilla and torta.If all else fails, it will be worth it to come back during non club hours to buy the a bottle of orange sauce($6) \u00a0to use on other people's tacos.In search of flavorSalty McCrackerson", "Date": "2009-05-18", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Binny M.", "ReviewID": "BnUDZxqSOnLRcYwJFxWZYw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "been eating here for for a long time.

Also, an enchilada usually involves some sort of sauce. I ordered a combo plate with two cheese enchiladas and one chile relleno (pretty standard stuff). I asked for sour cream and guacamole and corn tortillas, same as I would at any other taqueria, and got none of them. In fact, I noticed that there were no tortillas and asked the girl behind the counter for some and was rebuffed by the guy in the kitchen! He actually stood in front of a shelf full of tortillas and told me they didn't \"do tortillas\". I don't think this was a misunderstanding; I think the guy really refused to give me any tortillas. He also told me they were out of chile rellenos. No chile rellenos? At 11:45AM? That's pretty bad.

You would think that these are off hours, but the place was relatively packed with only one table available to sit at. I would have gone to Iguanas but they're closed on Sundays.I ordered the chicken quesadilla, no guacamole and a small soft-drink. Somehow on my first fill-up, I do not see the $.60 refill sign and as I usually do, only fill my cup half-way.My food comes and I can already see it's going to be a greasy mess. This was the most disgusting quesadilla I've ever had. I'd say it was 50% grease and 30% runny sour cream with barely any noticeable cheese or salsa. I finish the first half by basically force-swallowing it with the aide of my drink.I don't look forward to eating the second half but I'm hungry. I go to refill my cup and as I am filling it up, there is an old lady yelling at me \"sitty cent! sitty cent!\" It's at this point I notice the aforementioned sign, own up, and throw the lady $.75 in quarters, to which she gives me a nickel back (I guess they tax refills).At this point, I'm surprised they're not charging me for extra napkins to finish their disgusting, greasy quesadilla. I only get half-way through the second half and happily admit defeat, I'm sure my stomach was thrilled.The food here is disgusting, I can't believe they're charging $.60 for refills on what is 2-5 cents on syrup and carbonated water and was overall a very negative experience.Save your money and go around the block to Iguanas.

This place from appearance from the outside looks like those old school houses that just got turned into a taqueria. The food here is not that good but the \"orange sauce\" (if you haven't tired it, brace yourself that it's pretty spicy, it's a good spice so don't worry) makes everything taste all the better. I think this place is only popular because of their sauce, without it this place would be ordinary. Who knew just one thing would be a phenomena?! I do have to say they have the best Chicken Quesadilla... Oh how I'm so in love how the tortilla is crispy while the chicken is still moist with lots of orange sauce!! Seriously, their sauce is a MUST try! The other dishes are OK, it's blah like other taquerias. I would suggest you to never come here after 8pm, because the line is ridiculous, especially during Fridays & Saturdays. This place doesn't have enough room to eat so prepare yourself when it's pack because usually everyone either takes it togo or eat outside. The ambiance is average, it has it's days when it's awful loud or real quiet. This place is very plain when it comes to decorations, there's nothing to really keep you occupied and look around besides your phone or having the anticipation of tasting that yummy sauce, or there's windows you can stare out in the distance if you don't feel doing any of the other two. Another suggestion is if you plan on parking in the JackInTheBox lot, make it quick like if you plan to take it togo, because they do snitch. The parking is horrible, so the best place would probably be the garage, but if your not willing to pay by hour there's always the streets to get rid of those coins you've been saving up for times like these.Last Impression: Without their orange sauce and Chicken Quesadilla I wouldn't be coming here for nothing. I need to note myself that I need to buy their sauce that sells for $6 a bottle so that makes it a another plus because now you can bring it everywhere you go and make everything you eat taste all the yummier!

The restaurant is fairly small with a warm ambiance. The employees seem to hate their jobs because of the people they deal with on a daily. The food is relatively cheap and is prepared quickly. I personally enjoy eating at La Vics. I did not enjoy the \"orange sauce\" the first time I had it but it was an acquired taste for me. Today, I visited La Vics, and had a super carne asada burrito, which was pretty filling. I believe as far as their product goes It was really good. There service is quick, their product is cheap, and it is easy to take to go. There are a couple things I believe that they need to work on. One thing is customer service, the employee's deal with a lot of drunk customers late at night, but are still unfriendly to regular customers. Overall my experience at La Vics was pleasant. If you are handicap, I'm sorry they do not have a handicap accessible way to get into the restaurant. The small atmosphere is cool and makes it seem like a very small family restaurant. If you're going for the food expect an average burrito but expect an amazing spicy orange sauce. The convenience level at La Vics brings clientele in.

When I tried my burrito, there was barely any guac inside. I was so disappointed. The meat was very salty but the sauce helped hid some of that salt. The rice inside the burrito was mushy and honestly, not my favorite. I gave up after 2/3 of the burrito, because I was super hungry.... but the rice was getting mushier with every bite. I grew up eating rice almost everyday, so I definitely am a very picky rice eater. I don't mind giving it another try, but I'd probably come back for other things, not a burrito. Maybe an order of carne asada fries. Two stars for now, and we shall see later on.

A few days before that, she kept telling me about a Mexican place called \"La Vic's\". She would describe how great their burritos were, especially their quesadillas. She would also tell me about their special spicy sauce that she loved to pour all over her quesadilla. I had never been to any other Mexican fast food place besides Taco Bell. So I was curious as to how wonderful their food really was. The restaurant was only across the street from the University I was staying at. I thought this was really convenient for those who loved to eat there like my friend. The structure of the place was very similar to a house I would usually see in a suburb. This really took an interested to me. Most of the eateries along the street were in buildings. La Vic's was nowhere near similar to the other buildings. This made the restaurant stand out from the rest. As my friend and I entered La Vic's, I noticed a huge crowd of college students forming a blob instead of a line at the counter where they ordered their food. It was very difficult to walk through the room just to go to the opposite side. I knew if we stood in line, the wait would be terribly long. Luckily my other friend was already in line placing our orders for us. Since we didn't want to stand in the crowd, my friend and I went up stairs to the sitting area to find our other friends saving a table for all of us. This area was not as packed as the place down stairs. Because I preferred to eat at places with not a lot of people, I thought this arrangement of the restaurant was very convenient. \u00a0 Prepping the food took a while. Twenty to thirty minutes had passed by the time my friend came upstairs with our orders. This was a bit of a long wait for me, partially because I was starving. Some of my other friends were not given some of the extras they asked for. Because of this, they had to go back downstairs and wait in the long line to ask for it again. So far, I had thought that the preparation of the food was not handled well. On the other hand, the taste of the food was very delicious. The tortilla of the quesadilla was crisp and buttery. And the meat tasted as if it came right off the frying pan. The cheese melted in every direction, which I thought was great because I love the taste of cheese. There was also a green sauce that was poured all over the inside of the quesadilla that I thought had an interesting flavor. Overall, I can say that La Vic's is a great place too eat in terms of their food.", "Date": "2012-08-29", "Author_Location": "Tracy, CA"}, {"Author": "Christopher V.", "ReviewID": "0MEXhxEXqw43MPPXvobHtQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The sauce is great but the quality of food isn't the best.

As a SJSU student I had to eat here at least once during my first year and I have to say it lived up to my expectations. The burritos are pretty good and well sized, a super burrito will definitely fill you up sufficiently at around 5 dollars or so. If you can make it there before 11 AM you can also get breakfast burritos that'll satisfy that early morning hunger. The prices are also very reasonable coming from a college student. Great for those late night cravings due the fact that their open till 3 in the morning. A con would be that the nachos aren't topped with real cheese but rather the fake nacho \"cheese\" that would be more suitable at a movie theatre. Now I had to mention this it at least once and that is the ORANGE SAUCE. Basically pure lard in a bottle but taste soooo good on your burrito.
