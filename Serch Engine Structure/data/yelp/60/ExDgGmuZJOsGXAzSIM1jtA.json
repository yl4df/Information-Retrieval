Great music, lively atmosphere and solidly good food. The corn was delicious, but I felt that it could have been spicier- a little too safe for my grilled corn taste.I got the chicken mole plate and boyfriend got the fish tacos- both were really great. We especially loved the variety of hot sauces available for us to choose from and spice our food with. The rice and beans were good but I couldn't help but feel like the beans could have been tastier and a little less drab. That being said, we loved our experience overall and will definitely be back.

I kept making eye contact with the waitress and looking over my shoulder at her as she walked by and when she was chatting near her station with another waitress... She looked right at me and proceeded to stand around and do nothing. Ridiculous! \u00a0A table near us was experiencing the same thing and got up and left about 15 mins in, and then she had the nerve to get angry about it for the following 10 mins (asking the table next to them what happened, complaining to the other waitress, etc.) She was rude to us when she finally did come by and serve us (I shared an entree with my mom but we ordered a bunch of appetizers and drinks, and she seemed pissed we were sharing an entree.... How much food can two people eat?!)About a year and a half ago is when I first noticed the service going downhill...There is always a wait and so you give your name to the hostess and definitely expect to stand around for at least 20 mins. Well after 35 mins of waiting and many people who came AFTER us being seated BEFORE us, my boyfriend and I and another couple who was experiencing the same thing looked at each other like, WTF!? she clearly forgot about us?! Each time we (us or the other couple) approached her to remind her we were waiting, she looked at us like she'd never seen us before and said something nonsensical..She was quite literally cracked out. I don't know why they hire such incompetent/idiotic staff who think they the Sh** and therefore do not need to do their jobs properly...I mean come on, the food is good.. but it's not THAT good!", "Date": "2014-06-26", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Matt M.", "ReviewID": "FfCB2DqglJFnUq8aYkknZg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In NY for the first time and met up a friend for lunch on a Monday.

I will say that the toppings--the salty cotija cheese, mayo, and lime-- added some flavor, but it was hard to enjoy under the incredibly dry kernels. I've had this type of corn at other restaurants so I definitely had some expectations. Unfortunately, Cafe Habana just didn't do it for me. And for the price tag of $7! Simply disappointing. I also got the roast pork dish. It is more appropriately priced and the pork and sides were decent.

It was my first time here, too but I felt confident that it would be a good time. Got there at 6:45pm and was told that there was an hour wait for a table for 4. Put my name down anyway. Tried looking elsewhere as a backup plan because I had nothing to eat all day (not joking) and I needed to EAT ASAP. Decided to wait instead. They didn't know how to pronounce my name. Whatever, it happens all the time. Got seated near the door - a bit tight in space but I liked that we sat near the windows. Minutes later, we were moved to a table with the blue couches.I heard the corn was to die for, but no one at my table wanted to order it, so we didn't. I got the Huevos Rancheros, to which the waitress said, \"I feel really good about it,\" when asked what she thought of it. I told her I want my steak cooked medium and my eggs runny. She said, \"Well, how we do the eggs here is sunny side up.\" I had to pause and think what the difference was between runny and sunny side up. Thought they meant the same thing. Whatever.My friends both got the Cuban Sandwich and my sister got the steak too without the eggs.Waited what felt like a turn of the century for our food to come. I think they may have forgotten it because I saw the waitresses chatting over our shoulders and pointing at our table. The food finally came. I scoured mine like a hungry hyena. Reaction: WTF is this? Steak too dry. I asked for medium, but what I got was something which a caveman burned and scrubbed too hard with charcoal. Mind you, by this point I was STARVING so I did not have extra time to spare to complain about my food. First, the long wait to get seated and additional wait to receive my food. It was overall a recipe for a stomachache, which I experienced.Aside from the belly pain, I tried using my palette to judge the quality of my dish. From scale 1 to 5, it was a 1. My friends liked their sandwiches so I was happy about that. If they didn't, I would have gone home in contempt.For the price and hype of this place, Cafe Habana delivered with a huge disappointment. Will I come back? NO. Not even for their sandwiches. If you want real and GOOD Spanish food (Cuban/Mexican/Colombian), go to where the real Cubans/Mexicans/Colombians go to.

Blame science! \u00a0 \u00a0 Anyways, any day I make it to Cafe Habana is a day of love. Why? Because they have a drink called \"Dia Del Amor.\" Don't read too much into things people, sometimes a chair is just a chair, & a drink is just a drink. Except this drink packs a smooth punch. Actually, it's more like a soothing curb stomping. Not a lot of cocktails can get you drunk but this one does the trick. Like a sandwich after sex. \u00a0 \u00a0 Speaking of sandwiches, get it! Find it on the menu and order it! I'm not entirely sure if the Cuban Sandwich is self proclaimed best in NYC or they actually have credible reviewers backing it up, but all I know is, it's as Cuban Sandwich as Cuban Sandwiches get (I've never been to Cuba, don't take my word for it)! Well, Cuban enough for the lady to ride her bike all the way from midtown and back to eat it; I'm pretty sure it's her favorite sandwich. She's into avocado & goat cheese, so if that tickles your fancy, the sandwich is a no-brainer. \u00a0 \u00a0 If you're more on the carnivorous side like I am, then I implore you to explore the Huevos Rancheros. I know your first instinct is going to be to try the Skirt Steak. Don't do it. Just... don't. The Huevos Rancheros is slightly cheaper but offers eggs and a cute little tortilla, so you can play with your food. If you find your steak a little drier than expected, you always have the option of slathering egg all over it. \u00a0 \u00a0 But let's say you're not too hungry. You're just here to chill out with your friends in an environment conducive for catching up (which it is), drinking cocktails, and perhaps munching on an appetizer or two. I give you-- the Shrimp Taco. It's introduced as an entree but let's be honest, 3 tacos is not an entree! It's a fucking appetizer and a slight insult to my manhood. Don't get me wrong, it's bangin'! It just won't fill you up. \u00a0 \u00a0 But let's say you don't like shrimp. Perhaps, somewhere in your past a shrimp killed someone you loved. Don't worry, I got you! If all else fails, get the Mexican-Styled Grilled Corn. It's laced with both Chili Powder & what I believe is to be cocaine. Under no circumstances underestimate how spicy it is. It burns so! good! I promise it can cure erectile dysfunction. \u00a0 \u00a0 But forget everything I just said! Because the real reason I ever come here (besides the lady dragging me to get her sandwich) is the Michelada.\"My tongue says Sangria but my heart says Michelada.\" - Sterling Archer \u00a0 \u00a0 Cafe Habana has the best Michelada outside of Mexico. Give it to the Cubans to make a Mexican drink better than Mexican Restaurants. Come on Mexico, pick up the pace. I really go out of my way in search of the best Michelada & I can honestly say, I love their version more than I've loved most of my ex-girlfriends. But be weary, it all depends on who makes it for you. Much like the drink: the Dark & Stormy.

It seemed very busy with a crowd standing around the front, the hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait. It wound up only being about 5 minutes until we were huddled into a cramped table between three bro dudes getting drunk on Corona and the bathroom. It was so loud inside that we had to yell to each other all night sitting face to face just to have a normal conversation. All of this is pretty typical for a place like this on a friday night on the lower east side, so it has little effect on my review. I give it 1 star based on my experience with their food.I like cuban food and having lived in South Florida for 8 years, Ive had my fair share. The menu claims that their cuban sandwich was voted \"Best in New York.\" This is actually the first Cuban restaurant I've been to in the city, but if this is the best New York has to offer I might have write off Cuban food til I return to Florida.First of all, someone needs to tell the chef at Cafe Habana that a cuban sandwich is supposed to be pressed. My friend and I both ordered the sandwich and they came out on a hard, flaky club roll that wasn't even warm, let alone hot pressed. The ham was cold and thickly cut. The cheese not melted. The one part that stood out was the pork, however. It was actually very good, and if they just knew how to craft a cuban sandwich it could actually be pretty good because this roast pork had some nice flavor. Sadly, it alone wasn't enough to make the sandwich appetizing.

I liked the flavor that they had on the corn, However the corn was not sweet so it wasn't as good as I had expected it to be. ATMOSPHERE: Working in, it was very relaxed and chill.

Not only is this place the size of my closet but it's so loud because it's so tiny. I was screaming the whole night just to talk to my friend that was right next to me.Luckily we were seated immediately but on a two top by the bathroom. Literally my chair was right in front of the bathroom door so people kept hitting me as they walked by but I let that go since I was hungry and just wanted to try the food.We started off with drinks since that's the most important part of any meal. My friend ordered the margarita on the rocks and I didn't feel as adventurous so I just stuck with a beer. The drinks here are NOT watered down. Her margarita tasted like straight up margarita so you're definitely getting your money's worth.For appetizers, we ordered the corn on the cob. AMAZING. it's drizzled and covered in goodness and it comes out in two so my friend and I were both able to have one.For our entrees, my friend ordered the shrimp tacos and I ordered the cuban sandwich since it was apparently quoted as the best cuban sandwich in NY. I don't know about the BEST cuban sandwich but it's just okay for me. It was a sandwich. Nothing fancy or special about it. My friend seemed to enjoy the shrimp tacos but i wasn't too satisfied with my sandwich. The corn was a lot better.There service was great in the beginning but towards the end since there is limited seating, there was one server lady with the tattoos that kept rushing us and eyeing our plates to see if we were ready to leave when we clearly weren't even half way through our meal. I think she came by about 10 times to see if we were done yet and eventually she just came over with the check....okay?Overall, cute little place if you're in the mood for cuban place and don't mind the wait and the loud crowd.

Not much of a wait during prime dinner time considering how cold it was that day.After enjoying the Cuban decor and some Cuban music, I decided to go with a Cuban sandwich as the description pulled me in, \"Best in New York\". I can't pass on that! My friend ordered the roast pork after our bartender suggested it.Next to us was one of the waitresses/managers who was having a quick dinner before her shift started. She was very bubbly and was livening up the already vivacious atmosphere of the restaurant. She shared with us sweet plantains which were some of the best I've had. We had some Cuban coffee to end the dining experience and it was also very good. Very sweet, strong double espresso.Our food came quickly and I began scarfing down the best Cuban sandwich in New York. Yup, the pork, ham and everything else was delicious especially with the chipotle mayo. Next time I have to ask for more of the sauce, so good. I tried my friends dish and found his roasted pork to be very delicious also. There were many sauces on the counter that he tried with it.We didn't want to get too messy so we decided against ordered the grilled corn.

For starters (no pun intended), the corn-on-the-cob has a great balanced flavor of mildly spicy and a creamy texture from the mayo spread. The Cuban sandwich is nice and hearty and should really only be eaten as a well-deserved reward after a long and strenuous workout. It is definitely not the healthiest sandwich, but a real treat when you get your hands on it.

As good as it gets!\"--Yelp, 10/7/13, on Cafe HabanaYep, that pretty much sums it up. Can Cuban food get any better than this? Not in New York, at least.The wait: I've been here somewhere on the scale of a dozen times. The only time I didn't have to wait at least 15 minutes was when I went at 8 a.m. (They used to open that early; they probably saw I was the only one there and decided to move it back to 9 a.m.) TIP: if you want to get your meal on while in queue, you can hit up the Cafe Habana To Go right next-door and start with an appetizer of grilled corn, sans line.The seating: Probably the most cramped place I've ever been. When it's crowded (and it always is), you've really got to squeeze by people. Get a booth if you can, and try to avoid sitting against the wall leading up to the bathrooms, as these are the worst tables in the joint. Really, if you have the option, turn them down. You will get bumped and shoved in your seat as people swarm past; even worse, one of the tables is right near the discard bin for dirty plates, so you will probably get splashed, too.The food: So why put up with endless waits and cramped seating? Because the food is ridiculous. Their Cuban sandwich is the best I can imagine. The grilled corn is disgustingly delicious. I've had the roasted meats, the tacos, the enchiladas, the huevos, etc.--rest assured, it's all going to be awesome! If you want something vegetarian, consider the Tlacoyo de Tres Marias, which I ordered on a whim once and was awed by the rich and complex flavors of humble but great ingredients. The drinks are usually strong and tasty here, so get a Dark and Stormy or a Mojito. The service is also really on-point, and the servers are friendly, every time. I doubt you'll ever feel like you're just waiting for the food to come out.Cafe Habana is a fun, lively restaurant whose heavenly food more than justifies the long wait and cramped seating options.", "Date": "2013-10-07", "Author_Location": "Sunnyside, Queens, NY"}, {"Author": "Marlon T.", "ReviewID": "jSZEyvuYgPu8ViPuIiuC9w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a quick snack so I went with the elote.

People were chowing down corn on the cobb in the streets with cotija cheese on their lips without a care in the world. I was not down for that, so I waited to be seated. Whats the big deal with their grilled corn? \u00a0Well, it is grilled corn on the cob coated with a little layer of mayonnaise (I hate mayo, but this will be an exception), covered with cotija cheese, and dusted with chili powder. I took my bite and the first thing I tasted was how sweet and tender the corn was- the type that isn't so starchy. Then, I noticed the texture of the cojita cheese- almost like a grainy consistency to it. The cheese didn't overwhelm the sweetness of the corn, but that chili powder definitely gave it a kick. I can take a little heat, but I thought the corn was really spicy (remind me to build up my spice tolerance). I would have to say that the combination of everything was new and unique to me, but I rather eat my corn with a just a bit of butter. Then, I heard someone next to me order the corn with \"nothing on it.\" Guess I wasn't the only one not feeling the toppings. I wouldn't say this was the best corn I had. This corn on the cob will run you $3. I also ordered the Cuban sandwich which was good, but could have been better with minor improvements. For $8.50, you'll get a big sandwich with roast pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickles, and ham pressed together. The roast pork was soaked in sauce which was good, but what wasn't good was the fact that half of the sandwich bread was soggy from soaking up all that juice. By the time I got to the 2nd half of the sandwich, I had to eat it with a fork because the bread literally could not hold its contents. The sandwich came out pretty quick. When I got it, the bread was hot, but the meat was only lukewarm and the cheese barely melted. Other than that, the sandwich was really good and I felt stuffed after eating it. Would I come back for their corn? Yes with nothing on it, but for $3, no. Would I come back for the Cuban sandwich? Yes, if my sandwich is hot when I get it. 3.5 stars, but not worth the bump up to 4.", "Date": "2014-03-08", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Cailin C.", "ReviewID": "eNYALoNoei_n6oQ_v7vD2w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't believe I can actually move right now.This place is absolutely great!

At first the steak tasted great and was beautifully seared but as we got to the other end we realized it tasted more and more charred. By the time we got to the other end we noticed it was just completely burnt. Kind of a disappointment there. Everything else on the plate was okay, nothing to really write home about or leave Mexico for.The wait on this Thursday night wasn't bad. We waited about 20 minutes and were seat at the bar. The tiny place was packed. It was literally elbow to elbow. Surprisingly the bar seats were the roomiest. I wouldn't want to be here on the busy weekends.

Now the food itself,Of course you have to come to try the corn and so I did. The corn doesn't take that long to come which is good(actually all of the foods we ordered didn't take a LONG time to come). What they put on top of the corn is actually really good, it's really soft and flavorful and it just melts in your mouth. The corn itself isn't anything special LOL.. it just taste like regular corn, it's sweet though.Moving on, I did try the Cuban sandwich that I was not a fan of. It was really salty in my opinion but this is also the first Cuban sandwich I had.. ever, so I'm not sure if it was suppose to taste like that. It comes with a side of fries which was good. It also came with tomato and cucumber.. but I wasn't sure how to put it in the sandwich so I felt like it was just for presentation.  I also tried the taco.. (forgot the name) the proportion is small, it's two small soft wrapped tacos. But it does taste better than the cuban sandwich! It comes with a side of yellow rice and black beans which I thought we were really bad.But for the price, it was pretty good (two orders of corn = 4 pc of corn, a cuban sandwich and tacos came out to be less than 40$!!)", "Date": "2013-05-19", "Author_Location": "Forest Hills, Queens, NY"}, {"Author": "Juan J.", "ReviewID": "J6ynSQEcbjj8U1T4qTk_Rw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Get the corn or you are stupid.Don't remember anything else, but I remember eating two corns. \u00a0Corns rule!!!", "Date": "2013-02-21", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Paige S.", "ReviewID": "cPfjcPA4J-Le1Tx_Unmv-g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Always so busy but the wait is worth it and the food is incredible.

When I visited SoHo the lovely Jane K. was my guide. When she asked me where I wanted to eat for dinner one night I told her, \"Where would YOU go with friends? What's authentically SoHo?\" When her first option wasn't opened, we wound up at Caf\u00e9 Habana... I can't imagine Option #1 could have been any better than this little place!And by little, I do mean tiny. The place doesn't seat that many (or, maybe it does, and my Mainer-sense of wide open spaces can't wrap itself around such intimate, close seating among strangers; that's something we just don't do!), and the wait was out the door. And while that may have turned me off most places in northern New England, in NYC: small locale + long wait = no prob.We were eventually seated at the bar, and I asked our server what she would get if she were vegetarian because I was torn between two things: the vegetarian tacos or Tlacoyos Tres Marias. \"Well, some folks just don't like cactus. Personally, I'd go with the Tlacoyos Tres Marias. I mean, it's fried - how can you go wrong with that, right?\" Side note: if your server is cool, and you're cool, and you connect - ALWAYS ASK THEIR OPINION. Usually, they won't try and up-sell you something they themselves wouldn't eat.So, I ordered the Tlacoyos Tres Marias (which I still can't pronounce or properly spell; #thankyoucopypastebutton) and the grilled corn. How could I not? Just about everyone in the room was eating one or had just finished destroying one and was contentedly picking at their teeth. When it arrived, two big ears of corn positively covered in cotija cheese (which I had never had before) and chili powder. After sprinkling some lime on it, I took a big awkward bite (because how can eating corn in public be anything but awkward; it is NOT a food in which you can eat gracefully). And then suddenly I realized I had taken many, many bites because I just.... couldn't... stop.... EATING IT. It was unlike anything I had ever eaten before. It was spicier than I expected, and the cheese - OHHHHH THE CHEESE - was distinct tasting and was perfectly complimented with the chili powder. I can see why they give you two! (Jane K. - you're lucky I shared, because I could have definitely eaten that second one!).My Tlacoyos Tres Marias came and visually it was exactly what I was expecting: a scoop of rice, a scoop of beans, and a partially fried corn mesa wrap topped with some sauces. The rice and beans are nothing extraordinary; I didn't finish them because they taste like rice and beans I've had before/could have anywhere. The actual goat cheese-sun dried tomato-black bean filled corn mesa, though, was DELISH. Each bite was a different blend of flavors - a little tang of goat cheese here, a little crunch from the fried corn mesa there. Very, very good.So, what did I learn from this experience? A) If you're not from NYC, don't be afraid of sitting on top of/talking over each other - it's totally normal here; and, B) GET. THE. CORN. Come here JUST FOR the corn.

This corn is fantastic, I brought friends the next day to sample the simple, satisfying dish. They both have Carib roots and both loved it as much as I do. I also had the Chicken Diablo sandwich which was huge and tasty. The accompanying fries are just ok. But this sandwich could easily feed two so just be aware when ordering. The frozen mojito was sadly a slushy, sloppy mess that I quickly wanted to hand off to someone else to keep. Next time I'd order a regular mojito then again as previously mentioned I'm a Miami native which pretty much makes me a mojito snob.

Yes yes, I'm late to jump on the band wagon, but you know what they say. Better late than never.I had my doubts, because it really is just corn. That's grilled. And I don't like cheese - mozzarella and cheddar being the only exceptions - so I wasn't too fond of trying \"cotija\" cheese. Wikipedia says it has a dry consistency much like feta cheese, and that it tastes and smells similar to the more familiar Italian Parmesan. My heart sank at that point as I despise parmesan cheese.I took the first bite, waiting for a negative reaction which never came. I took a second bite. I looked at my grub bud. \"Do you like it?\" Took another bite. \"OMG it's delicious!\" Another bite. \"AGHH. What is this?! Why is this SO GOOD?\" Chomp chomp. \"It's salty!\" This ensued until I finished the cob of corn.Cotija is a slightly salted cheese that isn't pungent like most cheeses. It is dry, but it's shredded in a way that's not reminiscent of feta cheese. It's presented in smaller, longer pieces, so it's much more palatable and pleasant to eat. The mayo with chili powder is such a power couple! That punch of heat with the chili plus the creaminess of the mayo.. oh my lordy. The corn is served up with slices of lime, so if you like some acidity, get on with the squeezing.I went with the huevos divorciados (twas brunch time), a soupy hot mess which was excellent! The tomatillo and red salsa had intense flavors of peppers and spices, and together with my medium soft scrambled eggs, was like a mini soup. The black beans were perfect for this dish, which I had requested in lieu of the potatoes, because I thought the homefries would get too soggy too fast for this watery fest.The \"sloppy pepe\" was an open faced cuban sandwich of BBQ pulled pork topped with 2 eggs and some pickled onions that came with a side of greens.

That being said, yes, the corn is quite tasty. My theory is that anything you eat off a stick is automatically more fun and therefore more delicious. However, I think the secret is that this cheesy corn hits three of the five tastes, at once salty, sweet and spicy, plus a squirt of acidic lime juice. \u00a0Also, it doesn't hurt that it only costs $2, which is almost unheard of in this city-- it's no wonder that everyone is gaga for Habana corn. In fact, all the prices were super reasonable, as $21.75 got us two tasty Cuban sandwiches, the corn, and some fries. The sandwich was particularly delicious considering the cheese wasn't actually melted enough. The yummy blend of flavors more than up for the lack of total meltiness, and I especially appreciated the understated subtlety of the pickles, which I normally dislike, but here perfectly complemented the rest of the sandwich.What's worth mentioning aside from the corn and the obvious cheapness is that if you find the restaurant too cramped and the wait too long, you can get the same food at the take-out store front next door. There's even a few seats if you want to sit and eat, although with this frigid weather I would recommend sitting to the left of the door to avoid as much of the draft as possible. Considering how busy and crowded the official restaurant looks, I'd definitely recommend sticking to the faster, cheaper and less chaotic take-out counter and avoiding the dining room. Prices are a dollar or two less, and you don't have waiter service so that also saves a few bucks.

Take it or leave it, if you will. But the long lines here are really annoying, especially when one sees large families inside eating 2 hour long dinners and they know that there are hungry people waiting outside in the cold. \u00a0I even locked eyes with one dude for about 40 minutes.

Tostones- fried flat pieces of plantains shaped in little discs. They comes with chipotle mayo and garlic mayo. SUPERB!

I'm not sure what kind of cheese was on it but that was my favorite part. The chili powder added some spice and the optional lime juice just made it perfect! I think we stopped talking altogether when the corn came. =P (yelp.com/biz_photos/NOh2\u2026)chilaquiles verdes con pollo ($7.95) - This was my main dish since it seemed intriguing. It was a shredded tortilla and chicken casserole cooked in green salsa and topped with cheese. It also came with a side of beans which I wasn't expecting. One bite and I was hooked! The spiciness of the salsa, the mushiness of the tortilla, the flavor from the chicken and cheese just meshed together really well. I kept eating it even though I was full since it was so addicting. (yelp.com/biz_photos/NOh2\u2026)cuban sandwich ($8.95) - Apparently one of their renowned items, it disappointed a bit. It's just a roast pork and ham sandwich with cheese and pickles on a roll. I sampled this from my bf...the pork was a little dry and wasn't anything too exciting in terms of flavor. It was a pretty hefty-sized sandwich though. (yelp.com/biz_photos/NOh2\u2026) fried plantains ($2.95) - This wasn't on the brunch menu but you can still order it. It added some variety to our meal and tasted like how fried plantains should...browned and slightly crispy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. I kept going back for more...yum! (yelp.com/biz_photos/NOh2\u2026)Now, on to the service. This is where they lost a star from me. The hostess was running around being a waitress when she should have been greeting customers and taking names down at the door.

Sounded great, not so much on the execution; the corn was flat and flavorless and you couldn't really detect much besides GOAT CHEESE and an excess of sour cream. On the plus side, the pinto beans and yellow rice were pretty tasty.Drinks (non-alcoholic) were disappointing. An enticing menu on the wall advertises a slew of jugos y aguas (juices and nectars) and a long list of licuados (smoothies/milkshakes). Turned out they only had three available aguas (including horchata and jamaica) and the juices were bottled and oversweetened. I had the agua de jamaica, which looked and tasted exactly like that hot-pink \"tea\" at Starbucks.Prices are reasonable, under $10.

Definitely try the grilled Mexican style corn! Do not come here when it was hot outside because this place does not have air conditioning (although I did notice an AC unit in the back of the place). This will not be an easy place to find because there isn't a large sign letting you know it's Cafe Habana and the only way you will know you found it is the line and the name on the door. Food - The corn was delicious and had a nice kick to it with the chile powder on it. The presentation of the food though was less than pretty. The chorizo tacos (chorizo con papas) just looked like a pile of lettuce and things on a plate and the chicken casserole (chilaquiles verdes con pollo) looked like a pile of green mush with beans. However, the food was delicious and very flavorful and the large portions were very filling. The iced coffee was also quite good and strong (definitely good for a hangover).Atmosphere - The place was packed when we went but to our luck, there was a table that just opened so we didn't have to wait. The tables were very small so brunch for three people was hard to maneuver with elbows and forks hitting each other. Again, it was very hot outside and with no AC, this place was not very comfortable although with the heat and ceiling fans, it did give the restaurant a very Miami feel to it. Service - The service was pretty fast but mainly because they were trying to get people in and out because there seems to always be a line out the door. The waitress seemed friendly enough and not too overly attentive but available when needed. Overall, I might go back in the spring or fall, but definitely not when it is hot outside.

Ok, time to eat right? Cafe Habana begs to differ. Service was terribly, terribly slow.... the bartender/countender was oblivious to our (and the ppl right next to us) presence, and just kept loitering around doing menial tasks... finally he turns and asks us what we are drinking. I especifically and clearly voiced the words: \"Virgin Mary\", my friend asks for coffee.... another 10 minutes later he comes back to hand me some BLOODY MARY leaden with Vodka; crass mistake. 1 star less for having to re-order.The mood changed as soon as the corn arrived; it was superb like everyone else attests to, coated with cheese and a very tasty red sauce. It was smaller than expected, but it was great. We both had the eggs with chorizo, and I was surprised to see that the chorizo (sausage) was actually already chopped and mixed with the rest of the scrambled eggs. It was good, but nothing extraordinary. In the meanwhile, my Virgin Mary was empty, and I needed to drink something fresh, but the water we had ordered three times already, hadn't had the dignity of showing up.

Here's how my experience went:1. The wait- 1.5 hours on a Monday night around 7:30pm.--If you come to this place, never come with more than 1 other person. If your party is more than 2 people, you really risk waiting a LONG time. All together there are maybe 30 seats in this place and they will fill up fast. They don't take reservations.2. Seating in this place overall is cramped. Other yelpers warned me of this. One yelper mentions being hit by an elbow in the back of the head from someone at the bar. I could totally see this happening. The entire layout of the restaurant is in a J shape and the curved part of the J follows the bar, so if you're seated in that section, keep an eye out for people who seem likely to get wasted and move around a lot.Even in a booth, it wasn't really roomy like a booth should be. The horizontal segment of the booth, eg the part your butt is on, is also somewhat short, making it hard for you to sit up straight (forget about leaning back). Instead, you end up sitting a bit leaned forward. (Which means you can eat less).3. Ambiance- It's pretty cool inside. The music is good and overall it wasn't too loud, though you do have to yell a bit to be heard hear and there. Another yelper mentions that there is a slutty dressed waitress there. It took 2 seconds to identify her- note to other yelper: you were totally right. The decor is cool (if you care about that). 4. The service was borderline annoying. When I asked for a virgin drink, the waitress (the one who dresses slutty) looked confused and asked why I would want a virgin drink and then also asked how to make it. First time that's happened to me. I ordered a diet coke instead. She brought me a regular coke and I politely let her know. No diet coke returned until I reminded her (after two trips back to our table) that I could still go for a drink. She admitted that she forgot and apologized so I didn't really hold it against her, but it does tie in to the overall sloppy unprofessional attitude she was displaying. 5. THE FOOD: Simply put the food is really good. Drinks were cold and the food was hot. Everyone raves about the corn which was also good, but I didn't feel that this was something of such incredible quality that it was worth being known for. If I went back to this place, the corn is an added bonus, not my reason for being there. The best part about the corn- it's the cheapest appetizer on the menu. We also tried the Taquitos which were incredibly small and didn't taste that great, at least not for $7.50.The fish tacos are also good but again, for what you're paying (~$13.50), they really have no excuse not to be.The green tomatillo sauce chicken enchiladas were better than the steak enchiladas and made well. The rice and beans that comes with pretty much every dish were also good.The bottom line is that this place isn't anything out of the ordinary. Their food is on par with what authentic Cuban/Mexican South American food usually tastes like at a good taqueria (but it's usually cheaper at a taqueria, isn't it?)When you should go to this restaurant:*Not hot out (there is no AC)*Party of 2 or just solo*When you really want authentic cuban/mexican food and can't get it anywhere else*If you absolutely must have their corn which is really good (but probably not worth going there just for this, in my opinion).*Just to see what the hype is about?Would I eat here again?

Okay, there are some days when the corn is off (like undercooked or something), but the cotija & parmesan cheese, butter, chili powder & a couple spritzes of fresh lime.. it's an explosion of flavors in my mouth and my tongue just starts DANCING, you guys! I've sampled everything--tostones, pollo mirador, cheese quesadilla, and the tortas, just to name a few. And not in one sitting. The chicken is always so amazingly moist. The beans and rice complement the meat pretty well also. It's never too overpowering in flavor or too heavy & starchy. Oh man, it's seriously such a great combination. And the drinks! The mojitos are made with brown sugar. SO good on a hot, muggy summer day. Oh and bartender Mike.. you're a hottie. HAAY!

The kernels were like chargrilled little gems, each one of them bursting with a rich flavor as they became nestled between the crevices of my teeth (toothpicks are provided). These were followed by two sandwiches. Mine consisted of a supremely soft, pure white cheese layered with avocado, black beans, lettuce, tomato, and a pleasingly spicy mayo. The bread was crusty and chewy, and the jalapenos were scattered on the side to be added at the eater's whim (I did this profusely). My friend had the baja fish tacos which I had a few bites of. The beer-battered fish was not at all greasy, and was tamed by the salsa and shredded cabbage. I wasn't big on the rice and beans, but after being lured in by sticky rice and adzuki beans, it's hard to appreciate anything else.The check came to 22 bucks, which was a good job for two appetizers, two sandwiches, and one drink, all served relatively quickly.

I don't think I have had a better cuban sandwich anywhere else. The cheese was melted, the pork was tender, and the sandwich was grilled to perfection. It would be hard to find a better sandwich anywhere.You can tell the roast pork was cooked for a long time and it fell apart easily as I ate it, almost like a pork version of ropa vieja. The black beans and spanish rice were good but the white rice that came with the pollo mirador was better. The chicken was tasty and had cloves of garlic in the sauce, which I thought were mushrooms (until I bit into it). The fish tacos were my second favorite dish, battered catfish stuffed into a taco, how can you go wrong?The reason why there are 4 stars and not 5 is because of the lack of ambiance, which is almost intentional.

I was disappointed that they didnt have any plantains (what kind of cuban place have no plantains?!) or ropa vieja?

IMO, it is their selling point and main attraction. They sprinkle some parmesan cheese onto a grilled corn. You can choose to squeeze a slice of lime onto it or not--I did, and it was delicious. The cheese just melts in your mouth while the juices of the corn and lime takes over your taste buds. SO GOOD. You get two cobs of corn per order.For my entree, I ordered the skirt steak with huevos ranchero. The steak was good. It was tender, and was indeed medium rare as I requested, but it wasn't as exciting as I expected my steak to be. Maybe the standard was set so high since I had previously eaten at Chez Jacqueline's the night before (whose steak is amazing there!!!). The inside was still tender and juicy, though. The rice and eggs were amazng! I loved the spices and seasoning they added to the rice. I gobbled the rice up quick! You also get some black beans with your order. No comment on the beans...they're just beans. All in all, the place was nice. The actual environment is pretty loud and compact. But hey, it's New York...most cafes/diners are loud and compact as hell!TIP: Come early and put your name down (we had to wait 30 minutes) or tell a server you're here waiting for a table for ___. Then take a quick stroll around the area, maybe go to a bakery and have a cupcake.

When we were finally seated, they gave us two tables with chairs against the front window. The tables were probably the width of an open magazine.We asked the waitress if we could wait for a group to finish so we could have their booth, and she said yes; she'd just have to clean it up and wouldn't take our orders yet. So we waited probably 10 minutes, and then as soon as it's all cleared, she tells us we can't move there because someone else came in and had a smaller reservation. She definitely got the \"under promise and over deliver\" thing backwards.Anyway, we were stuck by a small table. There was a strong, cold breeze whenever anyone entered or exited the restaurant (which happened a lot, since there were a bunch of people asking how long the wait would be, and they had staff members moving takeout supplies and food between this place and the order-to-go place next door). We also had to get up to let people pass through to sit at the corner counter. Really annoying.Onto the food. The grilled corn was amazing, as others have attested to. It was the most delicious and most unhealthy corn I've ever had. If you don't like mayo, you may wanna stay away though! Two cobs per order.I also had the grilled pork chop, which was good, but not great. A little hard to cut but the mushroom sauce was creamy and made up for it. The yellow rice and black beans really filled me up as well.Now back to the poor service. They forgot one of my friend's orders completely. Not like it was taking longer cuz they started it late or ran out of rice. Our waitress literally told him that it would take another 20 minutes for his dish to come out as she was serving ours. Really unprofessional for a place with so few tables. But she did give us a free order of fried plantains to make up for it. They were mediocre.Worth coming here if you have the time and want to try the corn. I hear brunch here is nice, but I don't know if I could stomach the wait.

So, let's have at it, shall we?First, the food. Everyone raves about the corn, which is indeed good, though not as stellar, I think, as everyone says. The Cuban sandwich, the only actual meal I've gotten here, is the same way: good, but you can do so much better, and at a far cheaper price. Second, the interior of the restaurant is better suited to an actual cafe, not a restaurant. The tables are tiny and they, along with the chairs, are reminiscent of 24-hour diners. In fact, the whole place seems like a glorified diner, complete with single paper napkins, rounded silverware, plastic cups, and cushion booths. It'd be cute were it not for two things: the prices and the wait.Oh, God, that wait. Look, I get that in New York City, you have to wait for anything decent, and that the wait time at a restaurant isn't always a direct result of the establishment itself, but I can't be in love with a place when I have to sit outside it for what seems like forever in the vain hope that the hostess/waitress/busser/bartender decides to finally call my name. And what's worse, during my experience here last night, my friends and I were inexplicably bumped off the list; when we complained and asked why, the answer we got was illogical and nothing was done to rectify the situation. By the time we were seated, we had been waiting longer than expected, everyone on the list after us was long gone, and there wasn't anyone else waiting to grab a table. Despite that, the service here is ok, even if I was constantly fearing for our server's life as she tried to navigate her tiny frame through the even tinier spaces between tables and chairs. Unfortunately, even for a space this small, it seemed understaffed, leading her to overlook us at times, most noticeably when we obviously needed another chair (seriously, the tables are so small, you can barely fit two people, let alone three).In all, I'm very \"meh\" about this place, which explains the three stars. Would I come back again? Most likely, though this time with slightly lower expectations and perhaps a book to read during the wait.Bathroom Grade: 4/10.

So when hundreds of people mention the word \"corn\" in their Cafe Habana yelp reviews, you'd better order the corn. The reviews don't lie -- the corn is pretty darn amazing. They've raised the prices a bit over the years. It's now $4.25 for two pieces (still completely worth every penny). The grilling can be hit or miss, sometimes the corn ends up a bit too charred but 9 times out of 10 it's perfect. Smothered in mayo, chili powder, cheese and served with a lime wedge, it's the perfect combination for a latin party in your mouth.For dinner, I also like the cuban sandwiches,the roast pork/beans/rice and the enchiladas de mole poblano (though not all at the same time). It's been awhile since I've had breakfast here, but I remember liking the huevos rancheros.The restaurant is tiny.

But the Cuban sandwich (voted best in NYC according to the menu) was a bit disappointing. Perhaps too much bread? and not enough pork & seasoning? Maybe if they had better hot sauce? (Not a fan of their red & green hot sauce....) But it does come with a mountain of fries! & the restaurant itself is super small.... NO leg room. Tables are literally inches apart. Super crowded and inconvenient, especially if you have to get up to use the restroom.

Our waiter was extremely nice and fun to talk to. We start off with corn for appitizers and if you like corn then you must try their corn! Each order comes with only 2 pieces so we had 2 orders. The corn is seasoned in butter and some sort of chilli spice and the combination between the two is fantastic! I loved it so much that I took the extra piece for myself!For dinner, I ordered their steak with black beans and yellow rice. Dinner came out in a promptly manner and the appearance of the dish looked great. The steak itself was pretty good, I had ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty well. The black beans were good, but for me what stole the show was the yellow rice. I had never had yellow rice before, but I will be having more yellow rice in the future after having it here.

It's like that really catchy song from that band that EVERYONE seems to like... This place draws a lot of haters just for being popular... and it's popular because the food is actually really good.My husband and I stumbled upon the Caf\u00e9 Habana one afternoon in the city... It was really by accident. I made him take me to this artisan sale in some gymnasium on Houston. When we were done, we were on the prowl for a place to eat, and we found Caf\u00e9 Habana. We only stopped in the first place because there was a line to get in the door... It's kind of this amazing phenomenon in NYC, in fact. People see other people in line, and they are like, \"Dude. There's a line. Whatever this is... It must be awesome. Let's get in line too.\" (Sadly, I'm not even kidding.) \u00a0Caf\u00e9 Habana is super tiny, and even with their secondary store front (which is just around the corner), there is hardly any seating at all. You're lucky if you get a table. Luckily, when the weather is nice, customers are free to sit outside on planter boxes and benches... But. \u00a0If you like eating at a proper table, you should probably get it to go.The food is stellar. I love the pulled pork, black beans, and yellow rice. They also make a mean Cuban... or so I have heard (from my husband, who has pretty good taste in all things food). :) \u00a0They have sugared sodas from Mexico... which somehow makes the food taste even better. But I think the real star of the show, as seen in many, many, many reviews... is the grilled corn on the cob. If there was any way for them to practically market that corn to the entire nation, they would certainly be batrillionionaires (I made that word up just now). It's grilled perfectly, and covered in cheese and some kind of sauce that I was never able to identify. I dream about this corn. Granted, I'm from Iowa... so I'm genetically predisposed. But honestly. It's fabulous.The service is good enough... It really depends on who waits on you. Some counter people/waitresses are sweethearts... and some really hate their job and really want you to know about it. No shocker there.Overall.

I'd like to mention one theme I've seen to a lot of other reviews.I see people on here complaining about the size of this place. Now, it can be frustrating to be in a small shop, to not find a seat and to bump into people. But this is New York City, people. And this place is downtown, in Nolita. Places are going to be small, so you just roll with it. The people complaining on here must be newbies to the city because anyone who's lived here long enough (I've been here 4 1/2 years) learns to accept the cramped spaces, especially downtown.To the food: really, really good. I'm not as high on the corn as most others on here. I found the Mexican cheese to be a little too overpowering. There's too much of it, for one thing. I scraped off half of it. I'm not a 'cheese makes everything better' kind of person. I love pizza, mac and cheese and cheeseburgers, but I don't need it on my eggs and on corn and with chicken and all that. Don't get me wrong, the corn was still very good. But it's not an epic food like many on here would have you believe.The diablo was quite good, although a tad bland. I think much of that is because I ordered it without the chiptole mayo. (I can't stand mayo.) That would have added some spice that the two chicken cutlets, arugula, roasted red peppers and black bean paste didn't have. But this sandwich, especially that black bean paste, was awesome.

DECOR : \u00a0It is simple. \u00a0I rather like it as it had several palm trees, yellowish painted walls, and a painting of a cabana boy trying to spit game to a lady on the beach as the centerpiece. \u00a0The space itself I DID NOT like. \u00a0It was cramped and VERY SMALL. \u00a0I think they missed the difference between cozy and just plain eating on the subway during morning rush hour. \u00a0This is NOT a dining experience that I expected from a dining establishment that didn't even have a visible sign of their restaurant name expect the logo on the front of the door to distinguish itself from just another hole in the wall venue. \u00a0The seating was CRAMPED. \u00a0The stools where we were had our backs to the window where foot traffic can see how nicely packed the diner is but nothing else. \u00a0In fact, the tables in this place were so clusterf--ked that if someone had to use the lavatories we would had to disturbed a fellow patron to tuck in the seat what is already a tight niche space as it is. \u00a0NOT COOL.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bar and the kitchen is connected with one just being as small as the latter. \u00a0BONUS POINTS : you can see clearly into the TINY kitchen and that the cooks are wearing white vinyl gloves. \u00a0So for sanitary purposes you get A+.SERVICE: \u00a01) My party and I did NOT know there were reservations being taken when you walked through the door and the royal blue curtain draping which has an equal effect on blocking wind as doors open for new patrons as it did for BLOCKING the welcoming ambiance one would expect at ANY dining establishment. \u00a02) Upon putting our name on the list for what seems to be only 2 parties ahead of us on the list we were given an estimate of 20 minutes wait time. \u00a0This 20 minutes essentially lagged to 40 mins upon which added to the 20 ADDITIONAL minutes I waited previously for my party to arrive = 1hr. \u00a0Already fuming I pray to the food GODS that the food was worthy of the wait. \u00a0As you will read further, it was NOT. \u00a0In fact, we were essentially SKIPPED ahead for a party of 4 that came AFTER US forcing us to have to take the bar stools in order to even get service. \u00a0Fine, that is what we did.3) The bartender was attentive but to his discredit it is hard NOT to be attentive when you are working in a space similarly to the l shape block in the game TETRIS. \u00a0Not much you can do to avoid people really.FOOD: \u00a01)The big PULL for this restaurant is their GRiLLED CORN MEXICAN STYLE (generous coating of cheese and chili powder served with lime wedges). \u00a0I had a teeny bite of this and as a NON CHEESE FAN, this was not the dish for me. \u00a0It was WAY too cheesy (good for all you LACTOSE TOLERANT folks) and the spiciness was OVERPOWERING. \u00a0The corn itself was fine and the lime juice was a nice touch.2) SLOPPY \"JOSE\" BBQ PULLED PORK SANDWICH (spicy bbq, jalapeno, chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato) - Correct me if I'm wrong but it does say BBQ in the name? it DID NOT contained even the slightest hint of BBQ whether it be sauce or the smokiness that was to be EXPECTED. \u00a0I will say this, they did stuff the MEAT and the bread was CRUNCHY hard which was good. \u00a0The presentation was also good.3) CUBAN SANDWICH - I am beside myself as to how a Cuban Establishment mess up a CUBAN sandwich. \u00a0It would be like Asian people F--king up MAKING RICE! \u00a0Ironically, on their online menu/dine-in menu it was voted BEST in NYC? \u00a0Not quite sure which year this was but I've had MUCH better. \u00a0The sandwich itself was BLAND. \u00a0At the very least I would have been okay with it being salty which it wasn't neither. \u00a0The bread again was the best part which was CRUNCHY and nicely presented but there were only so much bread one person can eat (Reference :Olive Garden). The one streak of sweet mustard was not enough to give the sandwich a good kick to the taste buds as it was only on one measly side of the sandwich. \u00a0Once again they do PACK THE MEAT so there's that.PRICE: \u00a0$9.75 + $7.50 + Tips = roughly $20 for my meal alone. \u00a0Decent NYC price but not for what you have just read. \u00a0Advice = I would try this establishment again but not in the near future. \u00a0It could have been an off day for them but one can never REALLY tell.", "Date": "2013-01-05", "Author_Location": "Queens, NY"}, {"Author": "Monica B.", "ReviewID": "XQF-60ft7yV_2RSDDgjWWA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "JB got a sandwich here and wasn't overly impressed.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't suggest coming here with more than 4 people. \u00a0Regardless, it's one of those unique places that provides you with an immersive experience, making you feel like you're somewhere very different than where your really are. ...And don't forget the beautiful ladies!", "Date": "2010-01-03", "Author_Location": "Knoxville, TN"}, {"Author": "Laur T.", "ReviewID": "gMwlDtSVggh-hiWPZCcolA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not sure if the corn is all that different from what I'd get in a street fair (for less too!) but I like it!Everytime I see huevos rancheros on a menu, I'm immediately transported to the times when we were in Acapulco over Spring break, with housekeepers and cooks whipping up lovely huevos rancheros for us.... and almost always feel torn about ordering it there and then!

My friend told me to go to Cafe Habana for lunch. I took his advice and stumbled on the small diner. It has a very authentic feel to it when you step in. Four tables with two chairs each and stool seating lining the windows. The place is not lit and has the essence that on a hot day only a small fan would cool the room.I ordered the Cuban Sandwich upon the server's recommendation and a Jarrito's Limon. It turned out to be $11. I was expecting a large sandwich and when it came out it was comparable to the size of Panera Bread's. I was disappointed at first glance but the sandwich was pretty good. The sauce and veggies were complementary to the fresh baguette it is served on. However, the biggest letdown was how much bang I got for my buck. By meal's end, my stomach was still growling. For a takeout lunch spot, $11 for a sandwich (no side) and drink is a little steep, especially when I'm left with more room in my stomach.", "Date": "2011-06-17", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Emanuel H.", "ReviewID": "192PN9oo3zvR-cPvkBPpvg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love corn. My friends know I love corn. I get irrationally excited and irate when I talk about corn to the point that I \u00a0border on the schizophrenic. Having said that, I am aware that corn is evil. I mean that thing is in everything around us and the corn industry lobbies extremely hard to get subsidies to produce cheap corn so that evil corporations can maximize profits at the expense of creating nutritionally poor food products that cause childhood obesity and health issues.None of the above is relevant. Because the corn here at Cafe Habana is legendary , to the point where it will probably dominate discussions on \"best corn places\" for at least 10 years (until I come up with my own corn concoction - corncoction geddit?)So anyway, the corn here is roasted/grilled and very very fresh. There're spices and cheese and creamy sauce that drips all over and makes you look very infantile while eating it but it brings out that childlike enjoyment in you, I'm serious. You go back to the days when you used your hands to really eat, without worrying that people judge you because you're not refined enough for not using a spoon or fork or knife.The corn - 5 stars - Cheap and incredibly tastyCuban Sandwich - 5 stars - decent price with amazing succulent juicy pulled pork that leaves you completely satiatedCatfish Taco - 4 stars - Probably not used to the taste and texture of the fish but the rice is oh so yummy yummyWait is pretty long (at least 30mins - 1 hr) so for that 3 stars.

The Cuba Libre was good but nowhere close to what the drink should normally taste like.The Mexican Style Corn was awesome and my wife liked the margarita (but come on anyone can make a margarita) so they get a star for those two items.I was comp my Cuba Libre because the waitress asked if the shitty seating was worth it for the food and I said \"Sorry but no.\" I was seated just outside the bathroom door.

I ordered the Mexican style corn and the Cuban sandwich, and once I took a bite from both of those in a fraction of a second I felt a bliss I haven't felt in a while, I was brought back to when I was a little kid when I used to eat Cuban sandwiches with my grandfather in some hole-in-the-wall cafe in Puerto Rico.

They also have a take out window on the side for you movers and shakers.If you can't get to New York any time soon, I'm bringing a little Latin flavor to you; a simple, no frills recipe for yummy Mexican Corn.Ingredients4 Ears corn, shucked1/4 Cup melted butter or margarine1/4 Cup mayonnaise1/2 Cup grated Cotija cheese (or more, I am a cheese fanatic). If you can not find Cotija, use fresh Italian Parmesan4 Wedges of limePinches of chili powder, ground cumin, ground red pepper, salt and pepperDirections1. Make sure to pre-heat an outdoor grill for medium to high.2. Grill the corn until hot and lightly charred for 7 - 10 minutes. Roll the corn in butter, then spread evenly with mayonnaise. Sprinkle the cheese generously and serve with a slice of lime and salt and pepper to taste.3. Pinches of chili powder, red pepper and cumin are optional for those who like a little spice in their lives.* If you do not have an outdoor grill, simply just boil the corn in water for 10 - 15 minutes and char it a little over a frying pan. If you have a George Foreman Grill (or anything like it), this will work too.Time to fiesta, enjoy!", "Date": "2009-02-16", "Author_Location": "Vancouver, Canada"}, {"Author": "Courtney M.", "ReviewID": "niJTHcDkWF9kiodmPfXa5Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went here a couple weeks ago with a friend for some late brunch.

No apology, no acknowledgement they did anything wrong (probably for legal purposes), no justification that they would be careful with these things in the future (at the very least if not admitting fault). Anyone with allergies, BEWARE. --I live in San Francisco and was visiting New York last week for work. I have been coming to Cafe Habana since 2005 and have always loved the food, decor and service. Last Friday seemed to be no different, but in the last year I developed a gluten allergy. I was served at the bar by Angela. I ordered the corn, which I shared with a patron next to me, and the Sincronizada Toluca. I asked Angela if the tortilla was made of flour or wheat, and she said no, it is made of corn. I asked if she was sure because I'm allergic and she said yes. A few minutes later, just to be sure, I asked if there was anything else on the dishes that had breading or batter because I'm allergic to gluten. She asked the cooks and she said no I'd be fine. So I got the food, and it was delicious. The tortilla did look more like flour than corn, but I trusted her word. Well, 30 minutes later as I was heading uptown, I started to break out in hives all over my head and neck. I took a few benadryl hoping it would go away, but it got much worse spreading further. The welts were exponentially bigger than past minor outbreaks, and then my lips and tongue started swelling. I ended having to go to the emergency room at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital where I spent the next 4-5 hours. Gluten free seems to be a popular diet these days, but there are many of us that have serious allergies. These questions should not be taken lightly and if you don't know whether it's safe or not, you need to err on the side of being safe. I would have just ordered something else. This meal cost me to miss an important work event, hundreds of dollars (not looking forward to the hospital bill), and most importantly a terrible experience since health is obviously the #1 concern. I was thankful to have a colleague nearby and was able to handle the situation in the best way possible, but I can't emphasize how seriously disappointed I am that this happened with Cafe Habana, one of my favorite NY eateries.

Honestly, there's no point in going to this place if you're not going to get this dish. It's the staple and a MUST have. That being said, probably not the best idea to come here on a first date - you'll spend about 10 minutes after picking your teeth and that's obviously not that attractive. Anyway, this corn is messy, delicious, and overall incredible. I decided to order the Pollo Mirador (sauteed chicken breast with roasted garlic sauce, spicy spinach & white rice) this time. I have to say that I was a little surprised at just how much garlic was in this dish. It was also mixed with a lot of lemon, which made the sauce incredibly strong and tangy. If you're into those types of flavors, then great! Me, not so much. The spicy spinach was pretty delicious and the rice was just your standard white rice. I do recommend ordering a side of tostones with any dish. It makes the meal complete.I wouldn't order the chicken again but the grilled skirt steak is bomb.

The service has gone from bad to worse, with the hostess making you feel as if she has forgotten about you. Once you get seated, it's a continuation of that same feeling of being forgotten. It's akin to the feeling when your parents forgot to pick you up from school because they were sooooo busy at work, only your parents are bouncing and dancing around to the soundtrack at work. The portion sizes and buzz effect of the drinks used to be this harmonious conjunction but now they are two estranged lovers looking to reunite with each other. I remember in the past getting a portion of food that left me full beyond my heart's content and a buzz from my drink that made me want to dance like a dervish. Now, I feel like I need to go home and have a late night snack and dip into my stash of the old hooch. Won't be in a rush to come back anytime soon because I've been severely let down.

The gross seems to attract the trendy.In the same way, Cafe Habana, a grungy retro Cuban diner on Elizabeth street, is consistently filled with model-esque dames, artists, and everyone of the aviator and Ray-Ban wearing category. In likening it to the meatpacking district, I'm not insinuating that Cafe Habana is a gross establishment in any way. \u00a0But, in its third-world-esque simplicity (there's no air conditioning, and the ceiling fans do little to alleviate your arms and legs from sticking to the plastic of the booths), Cafe Habana is somehow a \"chic\" institution.The line is siempre out the wazoo. So if you're in a rush, skip around the corner to the tiny take-out room and order your Cuban fare there. But if you're willing to wait in line so you can get the full in-house experience, do it. When your Cuban sandwich (Roast Pork, Ham, Swiss Cheese and Pickles on toasted bread), $7.55, comes out piping hot and dripping with delicious oils that only roast pork can conjure, you'll know it's worth it.But there's a requirement. Go to this eatery and you MUST (and I repeat MUST) get the grilled corn. Dusted with chili powder and sprinkled with fresh cheese, crunch into it, close your eyes, and feel that you're in Cuba. The corn's so sweet and the cheese so cheesy, the chili adds a punch - a true foodgasm in your mouth.The Chicken Diablo ($6.95) is a bread-wrapped package of blackened chicken breast, roasted peppers, mesculin and tomato with a chipotle mayo. \u00a0The Grilled Steak sandwich ($8.95) is filled with onions and peppers and chipotle mayo. The Torta di Queso Blanco and Aguacate ($7.55) is an avocado and cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato, black beans, and that same delish chipotle mayo. The bread at Cafe Habana is impeccable: crusty and crunchy on the outside and so soft, sweet, and delicate on the inside. The chipotle mayo seeps right in. The ingredients are fresh and juicy, the meat prepared so that all the toothsome juices are retained, and the avocado is perfectly ripe (a hard feat to achieve).If you aren't in the mood for a sandwich, you could always do breakfast food. Get a classic Cuban breakfast with Huevos Rancheros and Mexican hot chocolate or cafe con leche. Or do the rice, beans, and spinach plate. But of COURSE, don't miss out on that authentic coconut Cuban flan. Oh so creamy. Oh so smooth.

At least call it something else if you're going to completely bastardize and ruin it. \u00a0The Cuban Sandwich wasn't even invented in Cuba, it was invented in Miami and then taken to Tampa and then Havana. \u00a0I come from Miami and know what an ideal Cuban Sandwich tastes like. \u00a0If you want to know what it tastes like, next time you find yourself in Miami, look up Latin American Cafeteria on Coral Way and like 13th avenue i think and try that Cuban sandwich out. \u00a0I guarantee it's better than anything they have in Cuba even, it is the ideal Cuban sandwich. \u00a0It's like $5 or $6 instead of this $10 thing and it's 3X bigger and infinitely tastier than the pseudo cuban you get at cafe habana. \u00a0The cafe habana version of a cuban sandwich had cold slices of deli ham on it, loads of chipotle mayonaisse for some reason, chunky piles of pork that didn't even taste like lechon cubano in any way, barely any cheese (and it was unmelted and cold!) and it had cucumbers instead of a pickle and came on some brioche nonsense instead of pan cubano. \u00a0The sandwich is supposed to come huge and pressed in a plancha for long enough so that everything inside the sandwich is hot and the cheese is melted. \u00a0This sandwich didn't remotely fit that criteria and the end result was a worse tasting sandwich. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, this new sandwich they invented tastes okay, but it's an extreme insult to a real Cuban sandwich because it's nowhere near as tasty. \u00a0If you're going to alter a sandwich, the goal should be to make it better. \u00a0Otherwise, the altering was purposeless. \u00a0What I determined is that this place is not Cuban, it's not Mexican, it's not even Latin fusion. \u00a0It's an American restaurant with a very tiny amount of Latin influence. \u00a0But this place doesn't serve real Latin food in any sense of the word, this is overpriced stuff that tastes far worse than real Latin. \u00a0I think people like it so much because they haven't tried the authentic stuff and don't know how cheap and infinitely more delicious it can be. \u00a0Why would I or any person who knows about real Latin food ever come here again when it tastes worse, it's smaller, and it costs more? \u00a0The hippie servers are nice and provide good service, but again, I came here looking for Latin food, not hippie food. \u00a0The \"cafe con leche\" is completely American and they put it in a milkshake glass for us for Christ's sake. \u00a0It didn't taste anything remotely like a cafe con leche. \u00a0Cafe cubano is a very particular and unmistakeable taste and so far it's been very hard to find actual cafe con leches in manhattan. \u00a0They're just serving people starbucks style lattes and calling it cafe con leche and everybody's buying into it. \u00a0So don't come here expecting Mexican or Cuban food, come here expecting Latinized American New Age Hippie Food.

You could almost just buy their corn on the cobb along with a soda and make that a lunch itself.

I've never had corn with cotija cheese and the chili powder and lime flavor added just the right kick. The corn was perfectly grilled and definitely not dry. I'd go and buy some just for a snack!-Roast Pork w/your choice of beans and rice ($10.50): Caribbean-style shredded pork which was okay. Moist but a bit bland so I added the limes and ate it with the rice or beans which helped. I tried the red beans (vs black) and yellow rice (vs white). My fave was the rice which had a nice taste of lime.-Chuleta de Puerco a la Pimienta ($12.75): pork chop was a bit dry but the chipotle au poivre sauce was definitely YUM! Creamy and full of flavor, especially with mushrooms soaking in its juices.-Cuban Sandwich ($8.75): the sandwich was PERFECTLY toasted which made it good. The pickles inside too added a nice fresh and crunchy texture to the soft roast pork. The fries were, eh.If you want to have a serious conversation or get to know your co-diner better, this isn't the place to go since the noise level is high, you'll practically be screaming out.

We had the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. So we ordered, Julieta (the horrible waitress) took our order and along with 3 other parties that were sitting next to us. We all ordered the same thing, and in sequence. The first table got their food, we didn't. the third got theirs. Then the recently sat down 4th table ordered and got it before us. SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO EVEN CHECK UP ON US. I mean, I understand that this restaurant is small (in space) but busy, but wouldn't a smaller restaurant have BETTER customer service? You have less to cater to. But no, these girls just \"dance\" to the music and just talked among themselves. Geez, please at least fill our damn waters. Get over yourself and do what your job entitles you, sorry you flunk out of model school and have to work for the best restaurants in NYC. Ohh, so we asked the other waitress, because our never came around and we saw her standing at the computer doing sh*t. Apparently our order had a mixed up aka they never input it. After that we got our food like 5 minutes later, we thought the pork took long to roast or something, but it was the lack of their customer service. We ate as fast as we could and asked the check. They gave it to us, but we needed change, it TOOK ANOTHER 10 minutes to break a freaking $20? How does it take that long to break a $20?! We asked the waitress who we gave it to, she said it was coming... 10 minutes later, NOTHING. We asked another waitress, she finally gave us change.

I don't know, I haven't had other Cuban sandwiches in NYC, but I loved how juicy it was, unlike any other I've had before. \u00a0It's definitely in a league of its own in that regard, and I give Cafe Habana huge props for making the juiciest Cuban sandwich I've ever had, albeit slightly untraditional :)I originally wanted to swap out my fries for the sweet plantains, but was told there would be an additional charge of $2 or so. \u00a0Considering the plantains only cost $3.25 as a side order, that seemed like a ripoff. \u00a0We decided to just get them to share, in addition to our meals. \u00a0First of all, the fries that were included with my sandwich were actually really good! \u00a0They had a great crunch on the outside and were piping hot and fluffy inside. \u00a0Definitely not disappointing! \u00a0I expected the sweet plantains to be fried, as most sides of plantains have been in my life, but when these arrived they were more charred around the edges and were not sitting a pool of residual oil. \u00a0These babies were roasted! \u00a0I really enjoyed not having that additional oil slick in my mouth with each bite of hot, sweet plantain (and the guilt too).", "Date": "2011-01-24", "Author_Location": "Cranston, RI"}, {"Author": "Jimmy C.", "ReviewID": "wP_aFAf3rgjPLNGyKd59gQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As good as if you were having a Fine Cuban Cigar! FOOD:Absolutely Delicious and has an authenticity to Cuban Food. \u00a0Last time I came I only could try the grilled corn as we came on a weekend and it was packed! This time we came during a weekday and the line was more reasonable so we were able to be seated. Once again, the grilled corn is VERY original and a must to try as an appetizer, great way to start the meal. For the main course one of us got the grilled shrimp tacos and the other got a Cuban sandwich. Being from the south, I've had to say I've had better shrimp tacos, however they were still flavorful, many components built on one another and tasty. The Cuban sandwich lived up to the hype. It was made perfectly in my opinion. The shredded pork was soft, juicy and flavorful. The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There was a mayo based sauce already inside the sandwich with another sauce in a cup to add flavor to the tostones or sandwich for another flavor profile. It is a must try too if you come to this place.ATMOSPHERE:Had a great vibe in my opinion. It is very small and tight but creates a Latin/Cuban catina atmosphere from the 70's if I had to provide a visual. Seems to be always busy and has a somewhat hipster vibe to it. \u00a0SERVICE:Was pretty good for the most part. Being a controlled chaotic atmosphere due to the relative size of the joint, they handled things well. There really isn't a stand for the hostess so you kind of just walk in to the dining area and a hostess puts you on the list. When seated, they take your order, and since its so small it's easy to grab their attention if you need waiting on. \u00a0SUMMARY:Great Cuban Joint!

Maybe there was too much hype, but I just wasn't blown away by Cafe Habana. That's not to say it's not really good, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. Per the enthusiastic Yelp reviews I made sure to get the corn, which was pretty damn good, if not a little caliente for my pussy taste buds to handle. I also got this corn masa thing that was stuffed with cheese which was good but too too salty. The highlight for me was definitely the scrumptious margarita's served by a sexy ass bartender. I also really enjoyed the ambiance. I went alone to avoid any seating drama and sat at the bar. I actually felt like I stepped into 1940's Cuba. The vibe was busy and chatty but relaxed and casual. The crowd was incredibly diverse and super cool. The waitresses are friendly and gorgeous. The prices are extremely reasonable as well. There was also some guy filming some documentary about the place and he kept sticking his camera in my grill while I was trying to just devour some corn. I'm sorry, but me eating corn is not a pretty thing, and I would really appreciate if you would ask me before putting a camera up in my shit while I probably have an obscene amount of food in my teeth and on my face. All in all, it was a good dining experience, I just kinda wished I discovered it by myself and didn't go there with a million other rave reviews in my ear.

I have to say, while the food was decent, the service was so bad that I'm tempted to demote it to 1 star. When we got there, we asked the hostess for a table for 2 - she replied \"3-5 min\". After waiting (with a few others) outside for a good 20 min, we realized customers that came after us were being seated before us. When we asked for clarification on how long our wait was, the hostess replied hostilely \"You're not on my list!\" When we tried to explain what we asked earlier, she just stared blankly at us and snottily retorted \"Well did you even give me your name?\" I'm sorry, but who's job is it to put customers on the list? She never even asked! Finally, she scribbles our name on top of the list and storms off. Another 10 min go by and the hostesses switch off - more people get seated. We followed up again, only to find the NEW hostess's list doesn't even have our name on it! She transcribed the waiting list to the new girl and left us out, yet again! We were so steamed. It had been nearly 40 min since we arrived (when it was practically empty) and still hadn't been seated. With a bit of irony, the obnoxious hostess turned out to be our waiter. FAIL.The food, on the other hand, was great. We ordered the grilled Mexican corn of course (a must-have, even for someone who's not really into cheese), which came 2 to an order. They were grilled to perfection, sweet, and topped with cotija cheese and chili powder. The sopesitos (corn cakes with 3 different salsa and beans) were good too. We ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and Cuban sandwich for entrees, and 2 hibiscus iced teas. The shrimp tacos were good but there was so much salsa inside that the tortillas were all soggy and falling apart on my plate. It was impossible to pick up and eat. The Cuban sandwich was devine though - toasted bread, pulled pork, ham, cheese, and pickles. The fries were just okay.The atmosphere is lively, but very, very small. You literally have your butt on the edge of someone else's table as you're squeezing your way into the booth seat. Your elbows are touching the person next to you the whole time and the tables are so tiny that your dishes are all precariously balanced.

You get your standard French tourists, those that live in the neighborhood, those that work in NoLiTa, the random foodies that trek heaven and hell to get their signature sandwich, and occasionally a celebrity or two looking for a low-key place to enjoy a bite (Leonardo DiCaprio has confessed to frequenting the restaurant). It is extremely casual, and charming to-boot. Pastel frescos line the wall, depicting tropical scenery to go with the Cuban cuisine. The delightfully tackiness of the d\u00e9cor is juxtaposed with the bold blue fa\u00e7ade, and serves to evoke images of a sidewalk caf\u00e9 in the tropics. The restaurant itself is quite cramped, and with minimal embellishments. The Service: Unobtrusive, yet unmemorable. Not completely sure if that is a good or bad sign, but they didn't do anything amazing, although they also didn't do anything awful to bring anything to mind during any of my visits. The waitresses, and this is worth mentioning, are all complete smokeshows. More than that, they are naturally beautiful. They don't really wear any makeup, and during my visits have always been wearing little sundresses, just gently draped over their perfectly tanned bodies. They look like the type that can get out of bed and look gorgeous. Definitely made the experience special. The Food: Perfect. They just execute everything so perfectly, it is hard to find standouts, but they definitely exist. As an appetizer, their most famous dish, and arguably their most perfectly executed, is the Mexican style grilled corn. This corn is a staple of Mexican street food, and is corn on the cob thrown on the grill, with cotija cheese (a slightly pungent, powdery cheese, not unlike the kind that comes from the green bottle), lime, and chili powder. When I had this growing up, they would also slather on mayonnaise and butter, but I like Habanas rendition much better. The corn is perfectly tender and comes on a skewer, the ultimate finger food. It is messy, you look like a pig eating it, but the euphoria that results thereafter makes it completely worth it. Two come in an order, to it is perfect for a hearty appetizer. With respect to entrees, Caf\u00e9 Habana has serves healthy and eco-friendly cuisine, so you are completely guiltless after having the best brunch eva. Their chicken quesadilla is perfect, and might win my vote for the best quesadilla in the city (trumping Dos Caminos for the title). The hearty portion is stuffed with grilled chicken, and the char marks on the chicken really come through after everything else. The kiss of sour cream on top creates for a very interesting relationship, and adds another dimension of flavor to the dish. Another favorite is their avocado and queso fresco sandwich. For those who don't know, queso fresco is a very soft and crumbly Mexican cheese, with the texture of feta but with a much milder, milkier taste. \u00a0The crumbliness and creaminess of the copious amounts of avocado marry perfectly with the crunch of the field greens that are in the sandwich, and the jalapenos provide for not only a more interesting texture, but for a acidic spice that cuts across the almost overwhelming richness of the other ingredients. It is a scientific fact that anyone that knows something about anything is absolutely certain that Cubans have the best rolls in the world. This is further reaffirmed with the bolillo that the sandwich is served on. As if the bread rolls in the world. This is further reaffirmed with the bolillo that the sandwich is served on. As if the bread just kissed the grill, the roll is slightly toasted and doughy and crunchy at the same time. I usually die a little bit inside whenever I see a vegetarian eating at a great restaurant, but here, they definitely get the long end of the stick. Now, saving the best for last, no Cuban restaurant is complete without the ubiquitous Cuban sandwich. Along with cigars, Elian Gonzalez, and communism, one of the biggest points of prides for Cuban's is their sandwich. Traditionally, it comes with pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickles. At Habana, you can request for them to put chipotle in it to make it a tad spicier, BEFORE PUTTING IT ON THE PANINI PRESS, and then you will never want to eat another sandwich again in your life. If you can ever get over your postpartum depression, you will realize that hope is not lost, for every minute that you are not eating that sandwich brings you a moment closer to the next time you devour it. Seriously, it is that good. The bread is crunchy after being pressed, and the roasted pork is so tender and contrasts perfectly with the brininess of the pickles.

I actually tried to email a manager about it, but their email address bounced back, so I'm posting here.First, the hostess made a mistake while seating people. After a long time of seeing people who arrived after us seated, we realized that we'd been passed over, that in the process of seating three and four-tops, she'd turned the page on her notes and basically passed us by. When we very politely inquired and pointed this out (our name was still on the preceding page, not crossed out), she immediately seated us, but with no apology, only some mumbling about how she'd called our names. She hadn't. We'd been standing by the door the whole time and heard every name. Both my friend and I have worked in restaurants and commented that this woman needs to learn how to apologize--mumbled lies really doesn't do it.Second, after we received our appetizers (which at first were mis-delivered to the table next to us that was seated after us (luckily, we had ordered the soup in addition to the corn), we had about enough time to take three bites before our main courses came out. When there wasn't enough room at the table, the waitress cleared the plates the corn was on, which meant we had to put the cobs on the table when we were done. Again, no apology.Third, and potentially the worst: I noticed something brown on my cactus taco plate and thought, Cool, a portabello mushroom. It wasn't. It was a piece of beef. When the waitress came back to clear everything, I let her know. She didn't say much but then proceeded to clear our water glasses (after we asked for more water). When we reminded her we wanted more water she said sorry--perhaps about the water? Perhaps about the beef on the vegetarian entree? Unclear, as it was a hasty, mumbled apology. If there is ever a time to comp a drink or do something substantial, that would be it. While I am luckily not a vegetarian, every dish I ordered was meat-free, so it would be reasonable to assume I was. Perhaps I needed to scream and be a bitch about all of these things to get even a real apology?Again, great food.

I gotta say for a crowded, somewhat small restaurant on the LSE chock full of hipsters with ironic t-shirts its actually a pretty nice, welcoming atmosphere.The service was good, I hunched over at the bar counter and a friendly dude dished me up some quasi-cuban treats. I asked him what the popular dishes are and told him I was thinking about the mole enchiladas and he actually said thats his least fav cuz its a non-chocolate mole (its specified on the menu as well). This was good to know since I was definitely wondering how the mole would be without the chocolate. He even went further to let me know the chef is a diabetic so thats why he cooks up a different preparation of it. I gotta say, anytime a server is actually honest with you and doesn't just try to push any dish you ask about, I'm impressed. And if you're a diabetic, rock on with the low sugar mole.I ordered the pulled pork dish. It seemed relatively authentic and everyone else seemed to be chowing down on it so i figured it might be the main deal here. Okay, so I wasn't blown away. I really wanted some sauce or something on the pulled pork...it looked and tasted very fresh but it was a little more on the bland side. On the upside, it wasn't too salty like a lot of carnitas dishes tend to be at shitty restaurants. The rice was seasoned fine and it also came with black beans. Overall, for over 10 bucks I expect more. I really wish I got the corn, since everyone has been raving about it, but I was definitely full by that point.I will also say I ordered a margarita on the rocks and he gave me a nice heavy pour in a big glass. Honestly this guy kinda earned it the extra star, otherwise I woulda given it 3. That drink was the best value at 7.50. But I will go back again and try the corn and see if I can get a carnitas burrito or the steak enchiladas since they're supposed to be good.As far as the ironic t-shirts, the bartender's was for a plumbing company...really dude? you work for a plumbing company?

It doesn't get much better than this. There are two establishments at this location, the diner-like atmosphere located on the corner, and the takeout (To-Go) area adjacent to the diner on Elizabeth St. We decided to eat at the takeout area, which is small in comparison to the diner. If your lucky enough to grab a seat in the cramped area, there are 3-4 small tables with folding chairs, and several high-chairs running across the bar countertop along the two windows. After you order, give your name, and pay, then move aside so the maddening crowd behind you can order. Wait patiently until your name is called and grab your food. There are a variety of hot sauces available on a shelf to the right of the cashier, along with paper napkins and plastic utensils.I've been to Habana Outpost during the warmer weather, but have never had the chance to check out Cafe Habana. It's winter and I needed my Cuban fix so it was the perfect opportunity.We ordered our usual:- Cuban Sandwich ($7.50) - fresh roast pork, ham, swiss cheese and pickle slices on Cuban bread with chipotle mayonnaise. Oh man, this mouth-watering sandwich was KILLER, as I'd have to claim that this was the best Cuban Sandwich I've had (even better than their sister location in Brooklyn). Everything about this sandwich was perfect, each ingredient complimenting the other, tender shredded pork, not too salty ham, fresh swiss cheese, and absolutely divine chipotle mayo.- Steak Sandwich ($9.25) - tender slices of grilled steak with caramelized onions, red & green sweet peppers, and their kick-ass chipotle mayo served on a crispy hero.- Sweet Plantains ($3.25) - This dish was a bit disappointing in presentation, maybe since 8-10 slices were served on a larger paper plate. I know they tout environmental awareness (take a look at their paper napkins which try to persuade you to use your sleeves), but the paper plate was just too gigantic for ~10 slices of plantains. Nevertheless, the fresh plantains were slightly caramelized, with the right level of sweetness.- Grilled Corn Mexican Style ($2.00) - A classic item that you must try, if you ask anyone who has been here. This is definitely an item to not miss out on. The corn is covered in Parmesan cheese and spices (paprika/cumin?) and complimented with a slice of lime. Don't forget to squeeze the lime juice on.

Walking through an outdoor arts market I saw ahead of me a crowd gathering on the corner. As I walked closer I realized it was the famous Cafe Habana restaurant which I had heard so much about. Of course I had to try it. So I put down my name, called a friend and 30 minutes later was joined by 3 friends. The hostess was not in the least way inviting or nice. But I guess that is to be expected when a restaurant is doing so well they don't really need to charm you with their service. We were told that they would not be able to accommodate a table of 4 and that we should try their take out service next door. We headed next door to a more casual, less hectic room where we could order from the same menu over the counter. There was a few tables inside and some seating outside. We ordered the famous Mexican grilled corn and the Cuban sandwich. A few minutes later our order was up. The corn was sprinkled with piles and piles of what looked like grated Parmesan, chili powder and lime juice. The result was fantastic. So good I could have had two (or maybe more). The Cuban sandwich is rated as the best in New York. I can't really attest to that and I think it would be hard to rate something as the best unless you have literally tasted all sandwiches and all restaurants in the New York. But, I can say this, it was the BEST I have yet had. The pork meat was full of flavour and juicy. The juice had seeped into the bread mixed with the cheese and pickles. It was amazing (see menu).

They could work on the other dishes a bit.We were a group of three around 12:30 PM on a Saturday, and we had to wait about 45 minutes, which I think is standard considering how cramped the place is and how few seats there are, and how it's kind of difficult/annoying to seat a three-top.The first thing I ordered was the Mexican corn, which was, of course, unbelievably scrumptious. I also love that it's impossible to eat it daintily and not get it all over your face. Messy is fun. My friend got the fresh-squeezed orange juice and we all agreed it tasted kinda funky.. I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the chicken and black beans dish because my friend wanted that and the chorizo tacos and couldn't decide which he would order, so I said I'd get the chicken so he could have both. I don't usually eat meat, but I tried the chicken and it was pretty bland and tasteless and came with a serving of plain black beans. The entree overall was a bit boring. To compensate, I ordered the cuban black bread (something that starts with an M, I can't remember the name of the dish right now!) which was just a huge slab of bread (not black) covered in a huge slab of cheese and some tomato on top.. I could have made it for less than a dollar and it kind of gave all of us indigestion from the massive overload of cheese (which wasn't even that good of cheese, not like the Cotija on the Mexican corn).In conclusion, the Mexican corn is amazing, and I'd come for that alone.", "Date": "2012-08-01", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Adam W.", "ReviewID": "7_dml3KzdAukKBgZEQ4vJg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As its been said before, corn is to die for.

However, my friends and I ended up having to wait about 1.5 hours because the a-holes at the table that we were supposed to get were just sitting there chatting and drinking beers, NOT ordering food, essentially hogging the table when there is a BAR that they could have been drinking at! Needless to say, I was very angry (didn't help that I had a couple drinks at the bar while waiting so I was getting belligerent haha). When we finally sat down, it was very loud and we could barely hear each other across the table and had to shout at the top of our lungs.That being said, the food was quite delicious. I ordered the cuban sandwich, which was good, but I've never had a cuban sandwich before so I can't really compare and say if it was the best cuban sandwich I've ever had. My friends got the pork platter thing, and that was delicious as well. And of course, we got the corn, which was good but I was expecting it to be phenomenal so I was a little disappointed.

We started off with a cocktail that was called something like Dia del Amor. \u00a0It had St. Germain, tequila, hot sauce, and lime juice, and was a wonderful, kicked-up take on a margarita. \u00a0I am especially fond of St. Germain and plan to attempt it at home, but if you don't fancy yourself a mixologist, just go there and get one as soon as possible. \u00a0With salt. \u00a0Delicious.The only thing that Cafe Habana lacks is enough space to eat comfortably. \u00a0It is usually always packed, so be prepared to encounter someone's elbow or get whacked by someone's purse at some point. \u00a0That said, the food and beverages are good enough to put up with the lack of personal space. \u00a0Just hang your purse or man-bag on your knee and dig in.", "Date": "2010-11-05", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Misha T.", "ReviewID": "pPIheugfH_2StpR85AearQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "wow a thousand reviews? that's pretty wild considering this place isn't that big or anything.anyways my cuban sandwich was solid. decent bread, good pork, good ham, good cheese, and good pickles.

No problem, just give us the menus and we will be on our way to this greatly anticipated meal.Mexican corn, check! Servisitas, check! Spicy shrimp, check! Caribbean pork, check! So my wife loved the shrimp and said she would come back 100x for it again. Me, and the pork didn't have the same results. It was just bland and needed more flavor for my taste. The corn app was new for me and I think that is the most popular thing on their menu since 9 out of 10 tables had it at least one time.Overall I think that La Caridad on the UWS has much tastier Cuban food for a fraction of the price and almost no wait.

A bold statement, and one that we had to decide for ourselves. I asked one of my sisters, who used to live in NYC, if she's ever been to Cafe Habana and she said, \"GET THE CORN!\" So apparently the corn is the way to go here. Other reviews online also remarked about the corn and how hard it was to get a seat. Well, we arrived at 1 or so and put our name in for a table for four and we waited outside for our friends to arrive. While waiting, we saw the little take out spot next door and stacks as high as me of corn being brought down to the prep kitchen. I guess the corn really is a popular item.Cafe Habana is a very tiny spot, with a bar/counter area for about 5 people and tables lined against the windows along with a booth or two. Waiting inside for your table means literally hovering over other customers as they eat. Plus, with the weather being as cold as it was, having people waiting with the door open made the heavy drapes used to keep the breeze out basically useless. (After we were seated, people would just stand in the doorway with the doors open causing everyone in the restaurant to freeze. Our hostess immediately ran to the front, asked the people to please wait outside and closed the big drapes up.)Abby and I both got the huevos rancheros and an order of the corn. Our friends...I forgot what they ordered other than one got the Mexican chocolate which turned out to not be as thick as we all imagined it would be.The corn was just as advertised. You really do have to get the corn if you come to Cafe Habana. The only issue I had was that I immediately had to floss after I finished my corn, but that's a personal issue not one for the restaurant.The huevos rancheros were a bit watery overall, but that did not affect the taste. The beans were quite delicious and the rancheros sauce had a nice tang and heat to it to make it stand out for other huevos rancheros I've had in the past.Bottom line, Cafe Habana is a great spot for brunch from the service to the food, everything was a big hit. There might be long lines and it's a tight fit, but if I lived in NYC I'd come back often for the corn.

I've been here numerous times and this is the first time they totally cheaped out on corn, which if you consider that they can get 3 for $1 in the grocery, they already score huge profit margins. If you have a piece of corn that's half inedible, scape off the edible parts and use it in another dish, don't give me half a piece of corn and charge me full price.Second, they forgot my drink order. Third, I asked for no jalapenos and the person taking my order made a point of saying that they would put a note in about no jalapenos. Guess what I got on my pulled pork? Jalapenos.Also they got rid of horchata at the take out place, which is a big downer.

Honestly Cafe Habana is good, not the best, but better than average. I came here for my second visit last night, a Saturday evening around 630. The restaurant didn't seem absurdly busy or crowded at the time, but we put our name on the waiting list and were told there was a 30 mins wait. That was fine, and reasonable, so we told the server/hostess we would walk around the block and come back a little while later. When we came back (no longer than a half hour later) she recognized us and got us a table within 15mins, very reasonable given the small nature of the restaurant, and the fact that it was prime time Sat. night. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This is when the dinner began to completely fall apart. First of all there were only two servers and one bartender (and one hostess that showed up while we were sat) supporting the entire restaurant. Our server didn't come over to greet us, or make any attempts at all to acknowledge us, for over 10 minutes. At that point she comes over and simply says, 'Hi, are you all ready to order?'. No apologies, no attempt to make us feel welcome or provide any information/offer any hospitality. At that point we were indeed ready to just get our order in and cooking. We ordered drinks, three alcoholic bevs and a soda, and three entrees all at once. After seeing no movement for awhile at the bar I finally saw the bartender get to work on our ticket. After he finished making the drinks I watched as they sat on the counter for close to ten mins. That was probably a 15 minute drink wait in total, and our food actually came out a mere 3 minutes later! That's terrible ticket timing. We asked for napkins and waters at that point and received them promptly, BUT god forbid we had any other requests or issues throughout the rest of our meal because our server NEVER came back to the table to check in. Once we were totally finished with our meal she cleared off the table and dropped the check without offering or asking if we wanted another drink round and/or desserts. Our waitress was extremely unprofessional, absent from the dining room many a times, and seemed to be actually just hanging out at the register area for no good reason. The table next to ours was loudly complaining about their experience as well. Andddd, the bathroom was pretty disgusting, wet with trash strewn about. I've been here before for dinner earlier in the summer, and I know it's an extremely high traffic spot, but they really just dropped the ball last night. Positives???? haha Food wise I absolutely recommend the shrimp tacos. The fish tacos are also good, but the tacos al pastor were dry and sort of bland, and you should try their 'claim to fame' grilled corn appetizer. Really good frozen flavored (mangooo) margaritas, and you can actually taste the alcohol in them! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Obviously I really didn't \u00a0even want to leave the waitress a tip, but since I'm in the industry I felt like I couldn't totally stiff her, and also because I plan to come back and give this place a last and final test before I banish it to the 'bad list'.

I think if you come for a meal, there's a minimum charge. Wow, their corn is so popular that you can get just that. Anyways my friend got an order of the corn to share and an entr\u00e9e each. It's two corns per order, which can make odd number of parties awkward. The corn comes out piping hot with mayonnaise, butter, cheese and red pepper. It sounds do simple but is so delicious. Corn is cooked perfectly and the toppings make it so flavorful. I wish it was all over the corn rather just on the top so I would get so full flavor all over. For my entr\u00e9e, I had the fish tacos. I don't recommend the tacos. They didn't use a double tortilla to hold the taco. So with all the sauce and stuff in the taco, the more I tried to eat the taco, the more it fell apart from all the sogginess. It was a mess.

It's definitely a staple. And it's the cheapest Mexican-style grilled corn I've had in the city ($2). The Cuban sandwich and fish sandwich were really good too. My only complaint: customer service (and that is where the 1 star comes off of.)In both times I was here, the customer service wasn't exactly the best. First time being that I don't take cheese on my corn, and when I had told them, they rudely told me I couldn't change it. I understand that it is partially my fault for not mentioning it to begin with (as I didn't know there would be cheese on the corn because there was no description for it), but I feel a place with good customer service would always offer to remake another one, especially being that their grilled corn is so popular.The second time I was there, it was packed and I was waiting for a seat. When I finally got one, the table was really dirty and there was food everywhere because someone had just gotten up from that seat. I asked the two cashiers behind the counter if they could please wipe the table. I work in customer service myself, so when I see a dirty table, I am quick to wipe it immediately. Especially if a customer points it out before I get to it, I react sincerely and definitely go ahead and wipe it. ...Well, when I had told the two cashiers, they had given me a rag and told me to wipe it myself.1) To have your customer wipe it for themselves is not okay.2) No customer wants to touch your dirty rag, knowing that you've probably used it all day to wipe other things.I understand that you're working all day, and you're tired and you're probably sick of customers, therefore I only take 1 star off.

The pork tasted like a Filipino dish called lechon paksiw...which is basically the leftover meat from the whole (lechon) pig with some kind of sauce added to it. Although the one that I ate here had all the leaner meat in it which I preferred. The hubby had the Grilled Skirt Steak..again which comes with rice and beans. I'm guessing that it must have been really good cus he cleaned his plate mighty fast. I did get a quick taste of it and it was very flavorful. My only complaint really are the tiny tables.

Based on the name i thought this was more of a cuban restaurant, but it's clearly more mexican, no cuban restaurant would serve yellow rice with beans. \u00a0The roast pork was ok, but didn't have much flavor, it's like they just roasted the pork without anything else on it. \u00a0My girlfriends cuban was very good and she really enjoyed it. \u00a0She thought the bread they use is the most authentic she's seen in the city. \u00a0Overall, not a bad meal, but nothing about it really stood out.", "Date": "2012-04-10", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "K L.", "ReviewID": "QM3O_swdlrIN9NVf_bVY5Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i call it CRACK CORN!!!

Restrooms were cramped. But that wasn't the bad part. The stinky part was that the toilet tissues were all wet. Strike 2. The cramped corner table that we sat in were infested with flies. All through the dinner, flies were everywhere. Strike 3. We ordered the grilled corn, which was the highlight of our dinner. My daughter and I shared the Camarones al Ajillo and hubby had the fish tacos. My shrimp was overdone and not spicy. It was more buttery. The fish taco was over done and hard to chew. It tasted like it was burnt. That 4 person booth remained empty the whole time we were there. Maybe we caught the restaurant on an off day. I don't intend to go back there any time soon.

Of course, like everyone else there, I ordered the Mexican Grilled Corn and the Cuban sandwich. The wait for the food wasn't long at all, somewhere from 5-10 minutes. The corn came slathered in mayo, cheese and whatever else they added to make it so delicious. The slices of lime were a great addition and made the corn even better! It was honestly one of the most unique foods I have ever tried. My friend and I couldn't stop commenting on how we were so surprised that it was so great. The sandwich arrived soon after and was intimidating. It came with some fries, which were very good (maybe I was just hungry). The sandwich was large enough to share with another person. As soon as I picked it up, the oil/juices started running all over the place. Of course I don't mind a little grease as long as the food tastes great. Each bite somehow tastes better and better.

The first was a sunday dinner and this time was sunday brunch. I don't really remember how the first time went, but I'm guessing it was uneventful, therefore, good enough. \u00a0However, this was the last time I would ever set my foot in this hell in the wall.I know that you wait at cafe habana. I know that it's a norm. But, we, a party of 5, had to wait for almost an hour when there was clearly an open booth sitting there for us. I don't know if the hostess is partly blind (if so, get them checked. oh, and sorry) or was just looking for a cooler crowd to fill the space in, but according to my friend in 4-in heels, whose name was on the waitlist and who went back and forth to check if she had called her name since we were given 30 min of wait, the booth that we would eventually take was empty for a while. then, yeah, the food came unfashionably late. I was sitting there dying of hunger, dizzy from fading effect of sugar from chocolate that was clearly not meant to sustain me that long, gaining consciousness only when food came out of that kitchen hole in the wall (yes, we were sitting right across that hole. life is irony.) only to find out it's for the pretty girls who came in after us. Even for a cynic like me, i can blame coincidence or some kind of well-timed laziness for the unhappiness the above caused me. But the worst was no coincidence. \u00a0My friend ordered this mango juice and it was not cold. My other friend who frequents here said they usually give a cup of ice with it for obvious reasons. Naturally, we asked the same waitress (short, stocky, dark, longish dark hair), who previously dumped the juice bottle on the table and ran for her life, to bring us a cup of ice, to which she nodded or something like that. it was so slight, i couldn't see. i just guessed as much. clearly, she had to have heard us. she was looking at us, kind of. and we were very polite, more than she'll ever be. But, i guess she didn't. we waited and waited, but it never came. I mean, if she had heard our request, surely she could have grabbed one of those blue cups on the counter and scooped some ice right below them and dumped it on our table like she'd already done with the juice bottle in one skip or a hop, even with her short legs. But, no...So, i ask the tall one (blond, skinny) for the ice who strutts to rescue. My friend! or, so i thought. I ran out of water pretty quickly (Sorry, it was a long wait outside and i had forgotten my water bottle. jeez) and was kind of hoping for it to be filled. I thought, since at least one \"waitress\" is standing by the register at any given moment, and therefore, by our table, someone should notice my completely empty cup. I mean, isn't it the first thing they teach when you start waiting: never let the water go less than half empty? omg my arms are getting tired... anyways, i had to ask for water twice before that america's next top model (if only tall and skinny is all you need) brought me my life source. Here's a tip: if you wiggle your bum less and walk faster like you have a job to do, you'll get so much more done.

I eat here every time I'm shopping on Broadway, because its only three blocks away! Though the food here is certainly not authentic Cuban (its a fusion of Mexican/Cuban), it doesn't take away from its delicious dishes. After being my favorite spot for three years now, I've had most of the items on the menu. Of course, the first thing I am going to rave about is their famous corn. Its grilled to perfection and is spread with a yummy mayonaise, and had a little kick of spice. :D Its a great snack if your not too hungry, and perfect for any time of the year, even though I prefer Cafe Habana in the warmer months. \u00a0 My next favorite are the tortas, a Mexican style sandwich on medium-thick crispy bread, if your a beef eater, order the steak, its juicy and delicious with mayo (if you're not into all the mayo, you can ask for none) and yummy roasted peppers. I only enjoy this heavenly sandwich a few times a year, but on my usual visits I often get the torta with chicken, the same sandwich, just with grilled chicken. When I went through my vegetarian phase, I ordered the Tres Marias, a bean and cheese filled crispy cornmeal with spicy salsa verde (a traditional spicy light green sauce) over rice and beans. This place has a great variety of drinks, from the Jarritos to their delicious limeade (oh so refreshing for summer!).  \u00a0This place is very popular, so there's a little bit of a wait, but I don't mind it one bit!
