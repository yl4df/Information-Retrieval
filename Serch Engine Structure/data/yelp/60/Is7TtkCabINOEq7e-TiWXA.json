I'm really glad we found this place! Don't let the line intimidate you.. as soon as we walked up the escalator, there was a very large crowd. I walked up to the hostess in which she informed me it would be about a 30 minute wait, which was NOT BAD AT ALL compared to other great restaurants in Vegas. Unfortunately, they don't offer pagers or take your number down to text you and let you know your table is available. But we managed to go downstairs for some quick gambling and came back in 25 minutes to check up in our table. Not too long after, we were seated! Very prompt on timing!After we sat down, our waitress came immediately and took our drink orders. When she returned, she had her pen ready to take our order and answer questions. She was able to give us great recommendations. The location was very busy so I expected a long wait time for our food.. WRONG! It came within 15 minutes and it was beyond what we expected. Definitely love the food and concept of it all. But what really got me to leave this review is the service. I was very shocked at how on point they are. Our waitress consistently came back and made sure we were good. My friend mentioned to me to ask our waitress for some jam and the waitress must have overheard because she brought it to us without even having to ask! BONUS. I wish there were more stars I can offer because she really did an amazing job and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Food was definitely cheap and affordable and comes in HUGE portions.. so make sure to come hungry or with a friend to share!", "Date": "2014-07-22", "Author_Location": "Westminster, CA"}, {"Author": "D J.", "ReviewID": "knu0h3hCzVu1NsxRVdL8LA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Just an Overrated breakfast spot in Vegas.They seem to focus more on presentation than flavor.

I ordered a Sage Fried Chicken Linguine to share with two other drunken people and that was way more than enough food for all three of us. The mushroom cream was ok. Wasn't too overwhelming but it wasn't the best either. There was a good amount of it which came in handy when we tasted the sage fried chicken. The sage fried chicken wasn't hot to temperature and it was also super duper dry. I only ate a few bites of it and I had to dip it in the sauce with my pasta to be able to enjoy. I did like the crispy green beans that were in the pasta. Our waiter was very difficult to find. Find to place the order, find to get a water refill, find to ask where the restroom is at, and to find to get the check. The place is pretty big but wasn't very crowded that night so I don't know how that works. (Bathrooms our outside by Fat Tuesdays)What we thought would be a quick bite ended up being pretty long.

And ever since I was introduced to Hash House A Go Go on an episode of Man vs. Food, I knew someday I would have to make a pilgrimage and tackle their ridiculous, over-the-top tower of chicken and waffles meant to feed a family of 4 but served to one person as their entree. Check that off the bucket list now.Being a Monday afternoon, my buddies and I thought it would be a breeze to get in quickly for a table. But we would be wrong once we got to the top of the escalator and saw people lined up on the benches outside. I put my name on the list for an estimated 45 min wait. No matter, the craps tables downstairs would keep us busy in the meantime.We made it just in time to hear our name called and sat down. No need glance at the menu. I wanted the famous Sage Fried Chicken stacked with bacon waffles, drizzled with hot maple caramel reduction, and crowned with fried leeks. I was the first to order at the table, but the final one to receive their food. Apparently, there were 5 other chicken and waffle orders ahead of mine. The wait was almost torture. The behemoth entree was finally brought before me and all I could say was \"Wow\". It was an impressive sight. A skewer and long knife stabbed through the top kept the whole thing upright. I removed both of them to break down the tower piece by piece. I have to say the chicken, two healthy thigh pieces, were succulent as hell. The batter with sage was crackly good. Very impressed. The waffles were OK. Bacon does make everything better but couldn't combat the somewhat dryness of the waffle. Some dousing of the extra maple reduction would help with that.At the end, it was \"Veni, vidi, vici\".", "Date": "2014-07-16", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Jessica A.", "ReviewID": "uoiVarOO1bH8a8mZEwaXbA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The waffles have bacon in them.Did you read that?

After a long hard night for my liver, I had to suffer the traditional morning hangover which ended up stretching into the afternoon (at which time we finally began our quest for food to rid this ailment). And even though the hangover symptoms had started to abate by noon, they were still present and included head ache, nausea, and disdain for flashy lights and loud noises. That being said, we \u00a0walked in the blaring heat on the strip, navigate through a loud casino, and wait almost an hour to be seated and place an order.I only complain about the situation I was in so that you can realize how good the food must have been to get me to stop my bitching and give this place 4 stars. The corned beef sandwich was garnished with rosemary, and the bread was buttered and toasted to perfection. The cheese to meat ratio was spot on as it enhanced the flavor without overpowering it. And the meat. So succulent and savory, my taste-buds went into overdrive trying to keep up. The portions were well aligned with the price as this is no Dennys or Ihop. The price may be around doubled, but so are the portions and the flavor is increased 3 fold. I could not even fathom finishing, even on an empty stomach with no hangover. This hearty meal was just what I needed and allowed me to recover my strength mentally, physically, and emotionally.All in all this was a great way to help with a hangover. The only flaws I saw which stopped me from giving the 5 was the long wait and rigorous route needed to find the place in the middle of the casino.

I ordered the HH Original which is smoked bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and two basted eggs. All this over the biscuits and then over a huge pile of mashed potatoes. Reading this on the menu, there is no spice - safe for me to eat. Not so fast... when the plate comes it is decorated in a red sauce (which I was falsely led to believe was red pepper cream) and took a nice big taste of it and turned out to be hot sauce. It sent my taste buds into a frenzy and I really wish they would just garnish the plate with the actual red pepper cream instead of adding the hot sauce to the plate.

If you don't want to wait for 30mins-hour try to go to the HHAGG off the strip. But I'm telling you, wait or no wait it's worth it!!!First off, the portions are HUGE!!! One plate can definitely be split into two or three if you have small appetite. You'll definitely leave with a full stomach after you're done. Their food is very flavorful. The most popular food on the menu are their Sage Chicken & Waffle and the Sage chicken eggs Benedict which was featured at the show Man vs. Food. Both were amazing! But since I'm not into spicy food & the sage chicken Benedict is more on the spicy side I like The sage chicken & waffles more. It was bomb!!!!

Even my tall husband said the table was too high. Let's just say it wasn't too ergonomic for eating.Our server's name was: Sassy..... She got our drink orders and Cory and I already knew what our orders were even before being seated.. so we gave that to Sassy too....What i like about Hash house is that... It doesn't have a cellphone network coverage for AT&T!!! And it didn't seem like they had wi-fi either.So pretty much all my check-ins and foodie Instagram photos had to wait....But I liked how Cory and I got to spend the whole breakfast date...Phone less... How liberating. I was a bit on edge.. but it was awesome. We played with straw wrappers; we checked each other's noses for boogers... we made faces at each other. Yes.. lots of things you can do while waiting for your order.Anyway...My gigantic SAGE CHICKEN AND BACON WAFFLES walked over to the table (like seriously, it covered Sassy's head while she was walking towards our table).... and man was it seriously massive. My jaw dropped and I instantly gained 5 lbs after it was placed on our table.Let's just say that It was a different taste of Chicken and a different taste of Waffle.The chicken is deep fried and breaded but with a hint of herb. It lingered in aroma that at one point; i thought i was eating a grilled chicken breast. Ha! Not.The Bacon Waffle completely took me over the edge.They weren't little bits of bacon okay. There were huge pieces of bacon embedded in that waffle. The plate came with two JUMBO pieces of chicken; and 4 jumbo pieces of waffle. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.Cory got the SAGE CHICKEN BENEDICT.... Oh dear lord.. that hollandaise that covered the whole plate? it looked like it was whisked into butter submission goodness perfection.Rich.Good.. Yummy.. Fried Chicken yummy.. give it to me. I personally liked his better than mine. And once again.. TOTALLY SHAREABLE.Highly Recommend to those seeking comfort food that can compensate bad hangovers.I gave this 3 stars because I wasn't sure if i liked the taste of the food itself; or if i was just overwhelmed with their extraordinary way of plating. I mean.. my two chickens were atop each other on a stack of waffles secured with a huge steak knife.I'd have to give this another shot again and try simpler items on the menu to break down their food artistry and concentrate on their flavors.Both our orders plus a little banana Latte was close to $50.00++.

Doesn't take that long to cook, and if a freaking Vegas restaurant that specializes in the stuff doesn't have it dropping in the fryer every minute, well shoot. Thirty minutes pass, and our server produces two massively towering plates of food. Four waffles (with bacon in between), two chicken breasts, stabbed with a knife to hold it all together. Lots of sage garnish (of course, sage-fried chicken and all). It looked impressive. Unfortunately, the impressions ended there. Mediocre waffles -- even the bacon couldn't save them. Even more mediocre chicken -- flavorful and seasoned, for sure, but undercooked. Not raw undercooked, but rather, the breading was still doughy and not fully crisp. It was fine and all, but considering I paid $20 freaking dollars for it, totally underwhelming. I spent the entire time looking on at her dish, which looked and tasted considerably better than mine.If you're a fan of Roscoe's and the like, don't expect the same here.

The waiting area is small and stuffy and full of hungover club-goers from the night before. We waited for about 30 minutes and we were tired of waiting.

Sage-Fried Chicken Benedict, which comes with layers of ooey-gooey goodness! The infamous Sage-Fried Chicken, fresh spinach, scrambled eggs, hardwood smoked bacon, tomatoes, and grilled mozzarella are served on a bed of grilled mashed potatoes and fresh split biscuit, and lastly they top it with their homemade chipotle cream sauce!! This portion can feed up to 3 hungry people. For something that cost around $13-20 and that is shared with 2-3 adults, it's worth it! The plate came out pretty messy, but it tasted amazing.

Once I arrived, the place was dead (it was about 9:30 pm), so I asked to be seated at a table for 6. \u00a0The hostess informed me that she was unable to seat me without the remainder of my party. \u00a0I was quite surprised as the majority of the tables were empty. \u00a0I explained that I am pregnant and experiencing morning sickness which worsens as I get hungry, could they please make an exception and seat me. \u00a0No, nothing she could do. \u00a0 At this time, I started dry heaving. \u00a0Now there is not a bathroom in this place, you have to go down and through the casino in order to find one, so I grabbed the garbage can from the hostess station and sat down. \u00a0I asked the hostess if I could at least get a sprite right now to calm my stomach? \u00a0She pointed to the bar and said, yeah, go ahead. \u00a0 I was shocked that with NOTHING TO DO, she didn't even offer to go and retrieve it for me!!! \u00a0 I rushed back to the bar and ordered my sprite (which they made me pay for at that time, instead of just tacking it onto my dinner bill - kind of unussual...) and sat back down to continue heaving. \u00a0As the dry heaving continued, I asked the hostess if I could put a food order in from the lobby. \u00a0 No, not until you're seated (but of course they wouldn't seat me). \u00a0When the dry heaving continued, I asked her to bring me out a biscuit (they give these out for free with dinner) \u00a0which thankfully, she did and I was able to wolf that down and my stomach started to settle. \u00a0 \u00a0Shortly after that, my party arrived. \u00a0They alerted the hostess, who then spent another 10 minutes readying the table (seriously?!) \u00a0and finally sat us. \u00a0 I immediately ordered some food and asked the waiter to rush it. \u00a0While the rest of the group looked over the menu. \u00a0 While we waited, I began to feel sick again. \u00a0I went over and grabbed a small trash can and brought it under our table, just in case because the distance to the bathroom was quite far. \u00a0 A minute or so after sitting back down, the manager, Shawn, walks up to the table \"I'm sympathetic to your situation, but I can't have this here\" \u00a0 I assumed he meant the trash can, so I said \"Ok, maybe you could bring me a bowl just in case?\" \u00a0 \"No Ma'am, I mean YOU; you need to leave. \u00a0I just can't have you in my restaurant, it's disturbing to other patrons\" \u00a0My jaw completely dropped - for one thing, there was no one else around us! \u00a0 For another, I hadn't actually thrown up a single time and hadn't even gagged while seated at the table!! \u00a0I was completely confused - \"the rest of your party is welcome to stay, but I'm going to have to have to ask you to leave\" \u00a0 At this point I felt terrible and burst in to tears begging him to \"please just pack up my food, I need to eat before I faint! \u00a0I need to eat! \u00a0Please!\" \u00a0At first he refused, but I think as the tears were flowing, he started to get a little embarrassed. \u00a0He went back into the kitchen and brought back a small plate of corned beef, dropped it at the table and then rushed away. \u00a0 As I wolfed down my food between tears, the waiter returned and we asked him to send over another manager as we were pretty horrified with the treatment. \u00a0 \u00a0A female manager returned. \u00a0She did not apologize for the behavior or the other manager, but did say \"if you'd like to stay, you can stay\" \u00a0But honestly at this point, we weren't willing to patronize the place anymore. \u00a0So she brings back the BILL. \u00a0 \"you expect me to PAY for this after the way I was treated?!\" \u00a0 \"well Ma'am, you DID eat it\" \u00a0 I should have walked out, but I was very upset and just handed her my credit card - $10 for by biscuit, soda, and a handful of corned beef. \u00a0 \u00a0We made a complaint to the hotel manager (The Quad) and although she was very nice and understanding, she stated that they did not have an affiliation with the restaurant and there really was nothing that she could do about how they ran their business. \u00a0Sadly, I won't ever be returning. \u00a0The lack of any empathy from the staff is ridiculous. \u00a0With so many wonderful places on the strip and every other experience this trip great customer service, this place won't ever make the cut again.", "Date": "2014-07-17", "Author_Location": "Sacramento, CA"}, {"Author": "Liz N.", "ReviewID": "Nd6lGq0Oa6b9xs4sWXADjQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The wait was quoted @ 40mins around 1 in the afternoon but it seems as though we were seated quicker than expected.

Also, way overpriced. $3 for a cup of coffee that tastes like it was filtered through the tighty whiteys you wore on the plane to Vegas? No thanks.

At that time I didn't think I would constantly write Yelp reviews during these last two years? One of the places I ate in San Diego was Hash House A Go Go. I ordered a salmon omelet. The one regret I made was that I didn't order the sage fried chicken and waffles after seeing some of the customers eating this dish.Yesterday morning I ate here. Despite the item that was featured on Man vs. Food, I knew what I wanted - the sage chicken fried and waffles. As I remembered in San Diego the portions were huge. To my surprise there were small slices of bacon inside the waffles. As the saying goes everything is better with bacon. I couldn't give this rating a perfect 5-star because of the fried chicken.

The Hash Original was awesome as well. Jalapenos with chili and potatoes (which I normally am not a fan of) was delicious! Came with a yummy biscuit and fruit! Such a good dish and actually manageable portions relative to the other orders. French toast with bananas and pecans: lovely french toast! The bananas came with the peel still on...could've done without that one, but the dish was still pretty awesome!BLT Bloody Mary was good only because it came with a mini sandwich bar: large bacon slice, lettuce in the drink, and toast with Mayo packet. Nice snack when you are starving and your meal is going to take 30 minutes to get to the table. The drink itself wasn't that great. I wish it was spicier and less watered down. I won't even ding the waiter for being rude and annoyed at our changing orders. We had every right to change the order once we saw how much food was being served, but he could have been cool with it. I love Hash House!

It tasted natural, actually like hazelnuts, and was just fantastic. And then the food came. All those reviews that tell you to split a plate with someone are right. Split a plate! I got the chicken and waffles, and they were as good as everyone else has already said. I can't recommend it enough. But there was more than enough food for 2 people on that glorious plate. The waffles had strips of bacon in them. Come on! So those were obviously great. And the chicken was perfect too. Fried just right, moist and tender, with crisp, savory breading. Pour some syrup on that pile of food and get ready to smile because you are in for a treat. This is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, and the price was a downright bargain by Vegas standards.

Crisp on the outside, & just a hint of vanilla flavoring on the fluffy inside. I got the benedict which was eggs over a biscuit with a red pepper sauce (instead of hollandaise), and a side of mashed red grilled potatoes. All was good, but a bit heavy, & was really disappointed they left out my spinach! I also had a tangerine mimosa, because it is Vegas & I was a complete fish the entire trip. Their tangerine juice tasted suspiciously like regular orange juice, & was not of fishbowl proportions that I am used to back home at Bill's! My other friend ordered a strawberry margarita, but instead got some fruit slushee thing which wasn't good either so I would not recommend drinking here.Two of my friends ordered sandwiches and they were good & stuffed with ingredients, & had nicely seasoned fries.Overall, you have to try this place once, but I am not sure if I would return.", "Date": "2014-03-10", "Author_Location": "Austin, TX"}, {"Author": "Jonathan M.", "ReviewID": "z8F9B5aIgzzZVYIiQh2Svw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good food made from scratch...

It's pretty, and impressive, but ultimately it's just a waster of food. Most people leave a good amount behind.The other reason for giving them four stars is that the potatoes were not that great. They were not terrible but not worth any room in my stomach. I focused on my biscuit (excellent!) and scramble.My brother had the chicken and waffles. It was insane! Two pieces of fried chicken and four or more waffles. The waffles had strips of bacon inside them.

I surveyed several of my friends that had visited the city several times. They were asked about all the best places to eat in Las Vegas. This place was highly recommended by all my friends. THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT! First off, Las Vegas is crawling with tourist. So upon arrival, the place was swarming with people. Hash House A Go Go is located in The Quad hotel, but it has several other locations in Las Vegas. \u00a0We decided to do breakfast there. When we \u00a0arrived the hostess told us the wait was 45 minutes to an hour. Well, per usual, I was hungry and since we'd walked there from our hotel on the other side of the Las Vegas Strip, we were eating there. Just our luck, two seats opened up at the bar and we pounced on them. That made our wait about 2 minutes. Again, my friends raved about the breakfast at this place and no one spoke about the service. The service was great! The place gave me a southern feel. So it felt like home to me all they way over on the West Coast. Immediately, the server asked where I was from. You don't realize you have an accent until you travel. Lol! She was so helpful. She explained the meals like she was the chef/cook that prepared them. After her spill, I decided on the Brown Sugar Banana FlapJack, which was enormous. It came with scrambled eggs and potatoes. It was awesome. I chose this because the man next to me was eating and enjoying it. I don't remember what my friend Andrea ordered, but she liked her selection also. The selection at this place is vast. Be prepared for a wait if you are with a group. The bar is ideal for two people. The serving size is really big. Once you are seated the service is fast. \u00a0Come with an appetite. I'm visiting Orlando, Florida in a few days and they have a Hash House A Go Go there.

I have bookmarked this place since my first trip to Vegas when I was 21, and all I have to say is FREAKING FINALLY after how many years? Goodness! NOW OPEN 24 hours?! Wait, what?First off: PACKED. 30-45 mins wait. Note that if you are a larger party, you will be waiting longer (5+ people = large). How they do their seating is: smaller parties first and then large parties. And you all have to be presented to be seated. If you check in with the host saying how many groups before you, she/he will not tell you that it's one SMALL/LARGE group before you - FYI.Service: Our waitress was sassy at first. Maybe because it was a busy Saturday and everyone got on her nerves, but it was definitely not early... We went around 11 close to noon and it was crazy packed. Later on she was attentive to our needs and became nice. We tipped her anyway!Food: LARGE PORTIONS. I cannot stress that enough. So if you're a hungry hippo, you'd be satisfied with your own plate, for sure. But a girlfriend and I split a dish. (I don't know what they're popular for, I just heard great things about this place). I ordered the Egg Benedict Smoked Salmon = HUGE. Nicely decorated and visually appealing; so good enough to eat for sure with a side of crispy potatoes. I wish it didn't have the biscuit, it made the dish extremely heavy. The dish included: cheese, eggs (duh!), dried tomatoes, spinach, salmon (not a lot at all), biscuit and mashed potatoes (starting from the top to the bottom layers). So definitely a heavy plate with the potatoes and biscuit. The flavor was in the middle, like some bites were very bland and others were good.I was actually not satisfied with my order. And it was on my end, not the restaurants. I should have went with the salmon scrambled dish - had a bite out of that and OMG so baaamb! Venue: It's in confusing area - The Quad, and parking was a hassle or whatnot. The restaurant is actually really big, and I couldn't tell because the way it's laid out.

I ordered the granola waffles with eggs and a side of sausage. At first granola waffles didn't seem to appetizing but I wanted to try something other than the regular vanilla waffles. Every single bite of that granola waffle was yummy!! Every bite tasted fresh and not frozen. My husband ordered the chicken and waffles and that tasted fresh as well. The chicken was juicy, nicely seasoned, and did not taste greasy at all! This is a hot spot for tourists so if you're coming here I suggest you come early!

Mad carbs! The chipotle cream was really good as it had a little spice to it but wasn't overpowering. It was too much carbs though.

We asked for the syrup on the side because I had a previous experience with another Hash House where it was overwhelmingly sweet. Without it, the waffles were good. They were soft and had bacon cooked in them. The chicken itself was tender and the skin was crunchy. As for taste, it was excellent. The corned beef hash was not as flavorful as I hoped it would be. The corned beef did not really have a prominent taste and I kind of wish the strips were a little bit smaller in size. The potatoes were the only saving grace for the dish - i love me some potatoes.Service was excellent. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. I dock 1 star because of the long wait time for our food. It took about 40 minutes for our fried chicken to come out and even longer for the hash to come. I guess we were lucky though. The table next to us waited over an hour for 2 burgers.Come here for an experience like no other!

There are a lot of meat options and the portions are quite generous, but in terms of food quality and price, a place like Denny's is a much better deal.The all blue crab cake with angel hair pasta and basil pesto ($11 appetizer) was basically a huge pan fried crab cake on top of a pile of pasta about the same size as the crab cake. The Boston Hash ($15) had an identical all blue crab cake, with crispy potatoes and two eggs. The potato hash was quite good, but both crab cakes were barely warm - two sides were slightly brown, but the inside of one crab cake was actually cool, as if it hadn't been defrosted before they'd thrown it in the pan. The sunny-side-up eggs were also quite sad. Gordon Ramsey might describe one of them as \"so raw it's about to fly away.\"I also tried two sandwiches. The grilled portobello mushroom sandwich ($13) was okay, except for the soggy bun and the barely-there goat cheese. The meat in the crispy pork tenderloin sandwich ($14) was very large but very thin; as a result, the pork was very dry and half of the meat was crispy batter. Also, since the meat had such large diameter, you couldn't actually eat it like a sandwich - you had to first eat only the meat and work your way toward the part actually covered by the bun and condiments. But by the time you reach the bun part, you won't even feel like eating any more. It'd be better if the meat was thicker with a smaller diameter, so it didn't dry out while deep-frying.Overall, nothing was really satisfying, especially after we saw the bill...

The sage as a bit of complexity to the chicken flavor that still mixes well with the waffles. The syrup was a little less sweet than most, which makes it perfect with the savory part of the dish.

Food. Staying at Imperial made it all the more tempting to just go there for each meal. In a rare showing of mercy to my wallet, I didn't do that.Before going inside the dining area, you'll see a number of autographed portraits and menus. Adam Richman's is one of them. I decided to do takeout for dinner. While it was very tempting to just get the popular sage fried chicken and waffles, I was in a 1-pound stuffed burger mood. Oh, that'd be one pound of meat. The entire burger was probably closer to 2 lbs., although not quite there.The mushroom and Swiss stuffed burger ($12.95) was amazing. Extremely juicy and gargantuan. Everything cooked perfectly. It was heaven just to see the melted Swiss and sauteed mushrooms. It's served with the cold fresh veggies on one bun half and the stuffed patty on the other half. Two big dill pickle slices in the burger. While the lettuce looked a bit wilted, that's probably only because everything stayed in the same closed takeout box for a few minutes.I'm guessing they used a brioche bun. Very soft and inviting. I personally think it could have been better with a slight toasting on the flattop. This just felt like the Juicy Lucy I had in Minnesota a couple years back, just in steroidal form. I think the burger could be too greasy and too imposing for some people. Fork and knife might be required. I for one needed a larger mouth.Burgers come with one side item of your choice. I got the basil pesto tossed crispy potatoes and enjoyed every bite. Great job on the crispy potatoes. It also had some broken-down diced tomatoes in there. The olive oil from the pesto collected a bit at the bottom of the plastic takeout container.Dessert is served all day here, and one of the servers mentioned that some items (like the bread pudding) are for in-house dining only. Might expect up to a 15-minute wait on that bread pudding.Breakfast includes french toast, flapjacks, and the Fried Chicken Benedict, all featured on the Man v. Food episode.

Definitely recommend splitting with someone or being ready to pack about half of it and take it home. Definitely make sure you go hungry. There are reasonable prices given the quantity of food. I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which was $15.95 and easily enough to feed two; this was one of the most expensive items on the breakfast menu. There were plenty of menu selections for the $9-15 range.The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is apparently their signature dish (with Man vs. Food notoriety). I was really impressed with the way it was assembled and presented. However, every bite ended up being a gigantic mess of hollandaise sauce (which they refer to as \"chipotle cream\"; did not taste anything like chipotles and tasted everything like standard hollandaise), potatoes, biscuit, and chicken. Had they made the dish slightly smaller and more manageable, it would have been a much higher-quality entree.In addition, call me a purist, but it is a travesty to call any dish without poached eggs a \"Benedict\". The thin tasteless layer of scrambled eggs on top seemed more like an afterthought to the dish rather than a main component. Why not call it a \"fried chicken scramble\" that happens to include hollandaise sauce?Other complaints: Drinks were really cool-looking but not very alcoholic. Wi-Fi didn't work and zero cell reception in the building.Overall, the place wasn't bad, but unremarkable.

Friends hash had very badly burnt potatoes, and he agreed that the biscuit was the best part.Felt bad for the friend that got the fried chicken and waffles.

On a side note, my friends ordered a \"LARGE\" cheeseburger with fries, a second Lumberjack breakfast, and an omelette. \u00a0However, just before our food was delivered, the waiter told me that the chef made the mistake of making a pecan pumpkin pancake on my order instead. \u00a0He offered to make me a new one or asked if I was ok with that. \u00a0I like them both, so I said the pecan pancake was just fine. \u00a0The breakfast was delicious, however, adding the pecans to the pancake fills you up fast. \u00a0There were a lot of pecans in it. \u00a0Granted, this is not a complaint...it's just a lot of food, so come hungry!! \u00a0In addition, the coffee was hot and fresh as it should be, and I especially love the pour spout sugar on the table (instead of sugar packets) because, personally, I like a little coffee with my sugar...if you know what I mean! \u00a0Overall, service was great, server was very prompt with our requested items, coffee and water was always kept full, and plates were cleared in a timely manner. \u00a0I will definitely be back to this location or another location based on the food quality alone and their delicious coffee! \u00a0Also,If you ever have a craving for the perfect drunk food at 3 am after you leave the club, then this is the place to go!Only negatives I noticed about the restaurant was the noise level in the room is high and it makes it a little difficult to have a conversation with people at your own table. \u00a0The other was the lack of cell signal in the hotel. \u00a0I like to post pictures on Instagram and Facebook, but had to do it after I left the hotel. \u00a0At one point I even had to leave the table and walk out to Valet just to take an important phone call. \u00a0But, that is not the fault of the restaurant...just a really old building! \u00a0What can ya do?!", "Date": "2013-11-20", "Author_Location": "Northwest, Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Lucas W.", "ReviewID": "YUY7hMJuQqFHb4CdVqUFCg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hash House puts good food in front of you in portions that would feed you for a week.

Perfect food to soak up a hangover...or compliment your already drunk self. I decided to ignore my vegetarian ways and stuff my face with all kinds of meat. My girls and I definitely inhaled all the food.The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken definitely lived up to the hype. It came topped on split, fresh biscuits with tomato, mozzarella, spinach, chipotle cream, spinach...(so many things on it!). The chipotle cream was delicious with it and the whole entree came with savory mashed potatoes.  The Salmon Hash came with scrambled eggs, fresh biscuit, and house potatoes. The salmon was a bit dry, but nothing a little Tabasco and ketchup couldn't fix. Then we topped our meal off with finishing up the granola waffle. The waffles were so moist and tasted amazing. Who would've though about granola waffles? Loved it! If you're a waffle fan, or even if you aren't, you must order the waffles. I'm not even big on waffles, but loved it and would highly recommend ordering it!All in all, it was an amazing experience!

We stopped by on a Sunday night with a reasonably large group (10). Since we wanted to see the Bellagio Show before is ends at 12AM we stopped by Hash House to check on the wait. We were told there was no wait and in fact they were slow. We asked to put our name down for a reservation and were told they dont take reservations (ok). We cam back round 11 and were promptly told it would be 20-25 minutes. We were not please but decided to wait because we where here and staying close by and all wanted toi tyr the food. After a 10 minute wait the greater came and told us it was going to be at least another 25 minutes because they only had one large table available and that table just received their food. Annoying, I should have taken this as a sign, but the majority of the group was fine although a little annoyed. One friend decided to walk around and saw that they were in fact very slow (almost no tables occupied) and also had a back room with a large table available. He asked the receptionist if they could put tables together since almost the whole restaurant was empty or let us sit in the back. All we receive was a \"no, we cant do that\". Cant or Wont? Still we waited on. 15 more minutes pass and surprise they open the table in the back section. So I guess they could do it. Finally we are all sitting down starving and ready to go in on some delicious food... Or were we. We placed our orders based on their \"late night menu\", which is lack luster at best (about 10 items). The waiter came round and although he was polite seems a little slow based on how unbusy they were. Heres were it went south quickly. I ordered the Sage Chicken Benedict and asked for the eggs poached, cause who the hell scrambles eggs and calls it eggs Benedict?! The wait for the food again seemed long for how slow the place was, 20 minutes, but for good food I would gladly wait. First thing I noticed when they bring my food is eggs are not poached. I ask the waiter to fix it and he graciously takes my plate back. 10-15 minutes pass my whole party is eating (although one guy got his food alarmingly later then everyone else). The waiter brings back my plate and it looks disheveled and clearly reconstructed. I look at it and touch it to see if they remade the plate or just switched out the eggs. The waiter quickly snaps at me \"I had them remake the whole plate\" to which I reply \"I highly doubt that, because its not hot.\" The icing on the cake and what made it so blatant that the food was not remade was my poached eggs were not even on the dish... they came on the side in a sad lonely little bowl. They remade the whole plate... really? There was no apology no admission he just carried on as usual. We received the check (tip already included because of the size of our group) and he went on about his business with out offering anything to compensate for the poor service and blatant lie. His name was David BTW, I was so pissed off I made sure to look it up so I could mention him, by name, in this review. The final nail in the Hash House coffin, the food aint that good. Its OK at best. Its over sized and over sauced and the taste is underwhelming. Its like they put extra portions of mediocre food on a plate cover it on bacon, mashed potatoes and sauce and call it spectacular. I know good food and this is no where close. Not a single person at the table seemed to be impressed, only one person even took left overs. The most impressive thing about the food at this restaurant other then the portion size was the huge branch of sage sticking out of their plate. That was pretty awe inspiring.

If you would like to see just how high your food can stack up, I'd recommend the sage fried chicken with waffles (not in the benedict form or the one with a side of biscuits), which you most certainly must disassemble or else your fried goods and buttery waffles of a tower will come tumbling down.None of us in our party tried each other's food, to be honest, because we were entirely famished by the time we got seated, placed our orders, and saw those saucer plates come at us. Forks were in, mouths were a gobbling as soon as our own plates touched down. I can, however, tell you all about the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and spinach hash, which came with the aforementioned fist-size biscuit, a slice of watermelon and cantaloupe, and 2 over easy eggs (your choice of how you want those babies done).The hash wasn't a \"hash brown\" (think McD's or Denny's versions) as what I had pictured in my mind. They were the pan-fried type, cut not in thin slices and pieced together as one but thick cuts of diced potato (triangle shaped?) that was not that crispy, especially after sitting at the bottom of everything else on that plate. I was potatoed out after a few bites of my dish (it wasn't like french fries where you can keep going and going..). The toppings were stir-fryed well (i really liked the tartness of the sundried tomato that made the other flavors pop), and lucky for me, there were lots of artichoke hearts. The eggs were buttery and the yolks, which smoothly burst through the whites by the forkful, were perfectly aromatic. The biscuit was soft and fluffy, easily pried open. My gluttonous self would have asked for more butter and jelly if I could, but the waiter took awhile to make it over to our table.I'm not all that intrigued with ginormous portions, but if I were to venture back, I'd go for the tower of chicken and waffles, one of the gravy dishes, or perhaps a sandwich concoction.

This dish comes with two crispy pieces of boneless chicken, fried leeks, and 4 pieces of thick waffles, and maple syrup. Waffles were a bit extra-ordinary such that they had whole pieces of bacon cooked inside of each one, however, I didn't care for it too much. I like my waffles a bit on the thinner side.

They quoted us 45 minutes, but it ended up being only about 25, which isn't bad. If you're at any decent breakfast place on the strip on a weekend, you'll have to wait. I typically enjoy going to the older properties to check them out and get a bargain drink, but with all the construction going on right now, the IP is hell to get in and out, plus the smokiness level is pretty high down in the casino. Luckily, HHGG has its own mezzanine-kind of level, which is all smoke-free.Since I'm with child over here, I didn't order a drink, but I did sample the Orange Crush (kinda like a mimosa with vodka and a salt rim) and the bloody mary (super spicy and very strong) - I thought they were both great! The bloody mary, especially, reminded me of something I'm definitely looking forward to after the baby is born in May!On to the food. I almost always get something with fried chicken at HHGG, so this time I went for the fried chicken benedict. The chicken was excellent, as always - delicious sage breading, not too heavy, and no bones! They came on top of spinach, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a biscuit, with a kind of creamy chili sauce all over. Oh, and underneath, was a huge block of mashed potatoes, probably the equivalent of 2 large potatoes! My one complaint about the dish was that the biscuits were kinda dry and bland. The others in my party got the vanilla waffle, blue cheese burger, and rueben sandwich (which is called the pub crawl). I seriously loved the waffle and the pub crawl. The corned beef and sauerkraut were so delicious and flavorful, they totally complimented the rye bread, and I usually hate rye bread. I thought the burger was good, but nothing too exciting.Yes, there is too much food! We were all super hungry (and the waffle was only like a half meal, since it comes by itself), and together we ate about 3/4 of everything.

Mediocre waffles, even more so mediocre chicken, mediocre/uninspired and really unimpressive unless you are easily impressed with large portions (maybe they are 'normal' portions for some of the people rating this eatery so highly) that are just barely decent.

First of all, the hash is not a hash, beware hash lovers. It is large chopped crispy potatoes with stuff on top. I got the corned beef hash, and it was literally breakfast potatoes with shredded beef on top. I was hoping for the delish smushy goodness of everything cooked together in a hash.. and it totally fell short. It was also served in a cast iron skillet that it wasn't even cooked in. What I really wanted was their vegetable \"hash\" with corned beef added to it. But they wouldn't let me... which I found strange. They said I could remove things but couldn't add anything. I didn't care if it cost more, I just wanted veggies with my hash. But nope. I also ordered they're \"famous\" blt bloody mary which also fell short. It was watery from the first sip, and I really didnt understand the giant lettuce and tomato in it. To top it off my hash arrived incorrect, 3 times. The poached egg, although cooked in water, was cooked to a rock. It came with a biscuit when I asked for unbuttered toast. And then the toast arrived with butter.

I was in total shock when I saw how HUGE HUGE HUGE the portions were. I couldnt believe it and wanted to double check the menu price cause there was no way we were getting all that food for so cheap, even in Vegas.

The focal point of said man crushes can be athletes, actors, comedians, office jerk, gynecologists....

I went with the sage fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was void of any sage flavor. I don't even know what sage is supposed to taste like, but I'm sure this chicken was void of it. It was bland, but, I will admit, it was the best cooked fried chicken I've ever had. Crunchy batter and all moist and sh^t inside. Nothing that a little bit of salt and hot sauce didn't help. The waffles were dense. They'd give Rush Limbaugh a run for his money. And much like Rush, there was bacon inside of the waffles.

When we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. Let me tell you, I would have been PISSED if I had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!Drinks - I ordered a Watermelon Lemonade and BF ordered a Pistachio Iced Mocha. The drinks were awesome! Mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. His Pistachio Mocha was sooo good! I was mad that I didn't order it. For breakfast both my BF and my BFF ordered the Tractor Driver Combo which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or french toast for one extra dollar. BFF got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and BF got the Vanilla Waffle. Their eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. His waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.My order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? This is what happened to me. I ordered the HH Original Benedict. Eggs Benedict - I expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. Whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things I need. I read that I would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of mashed potatoes, although I didn't know how that would fit in. I read about the red pepper cream, but I thought that would be along with my hollandaise. I read basted eggs, and I honestly didn't know what that meant. So I received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. I get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.The taste? Eh. The top layers are alright. The basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. The bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry mashed potatoes. Not a good combo.

Bloody Mary made with bacon-infused vodka, all the usual fixings, and garnished with a strip of bacon, romaine lettuce and a tomato slice. It also came with a single piece of white toast that my gf noted looked like a large Melba toast. I opted out of eating it, though. Good thing, too, because my jaw went slack when she brought out my order. The portion was gargantuan. I quickly dove in. The chicken tasted like something sweet had been added after the deep-frying, making it ridiculously savory in addition to being extremely succulent. The waffles were so chock full of bacon that it was protruding from every seam. The combination of chicken, waffle and syrup was the experience I wanted to have at Roscoe's, but never got. The flavors were so good that I drove myself to finish off both breasts and 3 of the waffles entirely. After that, I was certain my stomach was about to explode. My gf got the \"basic two eggs with potatoes, bacon and fruit\" for $6.95, but there was nothing basic about it. The plate was huge, and she could barely finish it off.

It was easy to find. \u00a0Just head straight through the Imperial Palace until you hit the escalators. \u00a0We were are very hungry after a night of drinking and dancing and hoped to not have to wait too long to get seated. \u00a0It was pretty busy and also a Friday morning. \u00a0We were pleasantly surprised to get seated promptly in a nice comfy booth. \u00a0I ordered coffee and it came quick enough and was quite delicious.One thing that stuck out in my mind as odd was the waiter told us right off the bat that the kitchen does not have any heat lamps, so the food is served out as soon as it's made. I thought OK, great, that means we will have our food quickly. \u00a0Eh, not so much. \u00a0 Our food took a bit to come out. \u00a0It wasn't excessive but we definitely waited longer on our food than we did to get a seat.Due to knowing the portion sizes are enormous we decided to split plates. \u00a0My dining partner and I chose the HH original Benedict. \u00a0It comes with bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, and is topped with a roasted red pepper cream as well as two eggs. \u00a0Additionally it sat on top of a split biscuit with griddled mashed potatoes. The potatoes reminded me of the potato pancakes my mom would make when I was a kid with leftover mashed potatoes-nice and golden browned and quite tasty. That was probably the best thing about the Benedict. \u00a0The bacon was good too, but hey it's bacon. Now for the not so good, the eggs were underdone and the parts of the white were still clear. \u00a0That kind of thing doesn't bother me, but I would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly. \u00a0The thing that was the biggest bummer was that the food was luke warm. \u00a0So I guess the no heat lamp thing doesn't necessarily work to their advantage because my food had to have sat back there for a bit before arriving to the table because it was not hot. \u00a0Also, the fresh tomato and spinach did not bring anything to the table. \u00a0Had the spinach been slightly sauteed or wilted and seasoned, it could have been a different story. \u00a0I think having those put on top of the Benny just made it even colder in temp. \u00a0Also, the whole thing was under-seasoned. \u00a0The red pepper cream tasted like roasted red pepper bisque that was under-seasoned and cold. \u00a0I really do like the concept of having a Benedict topped with lighter ingredients and sauce, but it was all cold and under-seasoned and disappointing. \u00a0I kept going back to the bacon, egg and crispy mashed potatoes. \u00a0I will say that I was able to split this with another person and between the two of us couldn't even finish it. \u00a0Our bill came to $12 each, and I was very happy, and even though it was underwhelming, it was still worth it for the price.My other friends ordered the Bananas Foster French toast-also huge, as well as the Fresh Mushroom, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato and fresh spinach hash. \u00a0My friend did not like her hash at all. \u00a0I tried it and agreed with her that it was completely under-seasoned. \u00a0I hate having to add salt at a restaurant. \u00a0I think it should come out seasoned correctly. \u00a0Also the salt shaker had course salt in in that barely came out the holes in the shaker-a huge pet peeve of mine. \u00a0The bananas foster was huge but nothing out of this world. \u00a0What I did really like though was the split banana topped with sugar and bruleed. \u00a0It was so delicious and the banana developed a very creamy texture. \u00a0It was served still in the peel, which I thought was pretty cool.Overall, the value is great, and the quality is also good. \u00a0I can only base this review on the one visit I made here, and there were definite flaws in the execution of the food. \u00a0 Although the plates are huge, impressive looking, the taste is what matters most, and it unfortunately was lacking. \u00a0However, on a whole, due to the value of the food and he fact that one plate can be split between two people, I would like to go back and prove that Hash House can really live up to its hype.", "Date": "2012-04-03", "Author_Location": "Lynnwood, WA"}, {"Author": "Mary Q.", "ReviewID": "YEYN6bccuck_LEcLvgIyGQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had always heard of the place, and this time around ,we went with a group of 6 people, and were staying at the Flamingo Hilton, which is on the same side and 2 Hotels down from The Imperial Hotel where Hash a Gogo is.

To be honest, classic and simple dishes like eggs Benedict or fried chicken & waffles were lost in the clutter of food put onto this one plate. Now, don't get me wrong, the food here is decent but in terms of flavor, it was lacking.I tried the Andy Sage's Fried Chicken Benedict which is like a unconventional version of biscuit and gravy mixed with eggs Benedict. The portion is huge and reads to be a delicious dish on the menu, but in actuality, there's nothing spectacular about it. Like previously mentioned, a lot going on. The chicken was a little bland but at least it was moist, the hollandaise sauce was too thick and bland, the biscuits were fine, and the mashed potatoes were average. I'd rate this dish 3/5. The take on chicken & waffles here was close, but no cigar. I thought the waffle was good (although a bit heavy) and I especially enjoyed the thick bacon that was cooked into the waffle -- a great combination of sweet and savory. As for the fried chicken, it was appetizing, but not lacking in bold flavors that a fried chicken should have. I'd rate this one 3.5/5.

Both the chicken and waffles were a bit dry, which was disappointing. Overall, the food was tasty (but not amazing), and the portions were pretty big.

\u00a0Despite my multiple trips to Sin City in the past I'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of \"twisted farm food\" - Hash House A Go-Go. \u00a0Having heard that a third (the other in San Diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the Imperial Palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.With late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a HHAGG shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt Hash House does everything big. \u00a0Taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, Noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.) \u00a0Menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table. \u00a0Hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because \"oh man, we thought this was a buffet.\" \u00a0Clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.Sitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around. \u00a0With prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when I chuckled saying okay the response was \"you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it\" - clearly I'm jaded. \u00a0Sitting back and listening to Rock You Like a Hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.Arriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking. \u00a0With a sweet, a savory, and a \"dessert\" there was too much food for four people. \u00a0Beginning first with the Blackberry Granola Flapjacks, my sister's choice although I'd lobbied for the Snickers Flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick. \u00a0With ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.Perhaps the most famous Hash House dish would be my order - \"Sage Fried Chicken stacked with our famous bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.\" \u00a0Golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious. \u00a0Stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel I have to admit that this was a huge portion of food. \u00a0While clearly not as subtle and refined as Bouchon's chicken and waffles I actually much preferred this to Roscoe's famous Los Angeles version and the less famous option at DC's Founding Farmers.Our dessert would be Andy's famous Bread pudding topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee. \u00a0With the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this bread pudding is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95. \u00a0A portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan. \u00a0Buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted Snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar. \u00a0Like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.Settling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had P.U.B. leftovers and the Robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to the door accompanied by Eddie Van Halen's Eruption. \u00a0Generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food Hash House A Go Go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.", "Date": "2011-01-03", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Julie F.", "ReviewID": "UUqPUcaV0GUmr0T2el4Hkw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There's a few locations for Hash House but we opted for the one in IP as it was closest to our hotel. \u00a0The wait for our party of 6 was pretty short maybe 15-20 min. \u00a0We were seated and I decided to share the chicken and waffles.

I heard the food portions were huge and I considered having us split an entree, but being on vacation we opted for being typical Americans instead. The food came out and it WAS huge. Stupidly huge. The pork tenderloin was the diameter of a dinner plate but the bun that it was set upon was normal size. Using the bun like a cookie cutter, I trimmed the excess pork so I could pick it up. The pork was awesome--just really big. Husbands burger was ok. It really didn't have any flavor and I was really turned off by the mashed potatoes in it. He loves mashed potatoes, so maybe that's why he thought it was so amazing. Eh. Mac n' cheese was good. Service started out great with an attentive waiter but by the end of the meal he had disappeared. I flagged someone down just as he reappeared and at that point his attitude had shifted. Odd. Would I eat here again? Only if I were to take someone who had never been here before.

We were seated immediately. I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was huge, and the waffles had whole strips of bacon in it. Yes, whole strips! Sadly, those were the highlights. The chicken didn't have much seasoning, unless you count the rosemary skewer that held everything together. Rosemary's a really strong herb, and I tasted it in every bite. I wasn't crazy about the reduction, either.My husband had a fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes.

I've heard fabulous things about it but never had the chance to go. So about two months ago, my friend is staying at a casino across the street from Imperial Palace. She and her friends were craving breakfast food and not a buffet so I said we could try this place. I arrived and told the hostess that my friends were already in there. She told me, (and not even kindly), \"We don't seat parties if they aren't all here, but you can check if they're in there.\" Well, they were seated and I joined them and we ordered our food. First of all, I give the food a 4 out of 5 -- Chris and I had the farmer's platter or whatever it was called and although it was good, there was just toooooo much of it. I think there's a difference between good and thinking something's good just because they put 5 pounds of food on your plate. Second, the service was second...no, wait...third rate. I have lived in Vegas for almost 10 years and seriously, I've had better service when Binion's Horseshoe had their steak and potato midnight special for $2.99. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when asked for a refill, the waitress seemed annoyed. Third, this place was way too crowded and not enough servers. Come on now...I've eaten at the Cheesecake Factory and you're practically sitting on their neighbor's lap as you enjoy your meal with your dining patron and you still don't get the rudeness or the stress that you can sense from the waitstaff. This way not be their problem so then the management needs to get a clue. Fourth, as we were paying our bill, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come back. Upon arrival, she tells us that between the kitchen at our table, she \"LOST\" our credit card. So not only was she a bit on the rude side, the was obviously tied up doing several other things AND she loses my husband's credit card??!!? COME ON!!! There had to have been at least 200 people in the restaurant and anyone would've picked it up and taken it. About 5-7 minutes later, I guess someone turned it in to the hostess and the hostess tried to find the waitress to give it to her. My hubby then got it from the hostess and although the waitress did apologize, you could so tell that she apologized really to save face and get us out of there. After that, I wanted to take the tip we had left for her. Normally I'm not so mean, but my husband is a busser and he wouldn't be that rude to anyone! I give this place two stars because the food really was good, but just overrated. I do think it's worth a try...and maybe not the IP location. Maybe Sahara is different...and when the M location opens up, then they have a chance to prove me wrong. We'll see...So Hash House a Go-go management at IP, if you want people to \u00a0pay way too much for pancakes, you can afford one more server or busser so your existing waitstaff isn't \u00a0running around forgetting people's orders, losing people's credit card or cutting people short to take care of others with a stressed out and uncaring attitude. 4 farmer's platters can pay a waiter's 4 hour shift and they'd provide better service so they can generate MORE money for your joint!", "Date": "2010-09-17", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Carol L.", "ReviewID": "uwjybCvf1Yv-VHro4B7NNg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yummmmers!!The portions are huge, and the presentation impressive.

We asked for a correction and the food had to literally be re- prepared from scratch. I asked the waitress if my meal would have the same amount of chicken as the other chicken dishes and she assured me they were the same. When my dish came out i was shocked at how little chicken was in the meal. I asked her about it and she said it was supposed to be that way. What was she talking about just a few moments earlier, then?! We even asked for the manager because the experience was just that bad. The manager came by asked what was wrong. Mumbled something about getting that issue taken care of. And never heard an apology from him or the waitress. In fact we hardly ever saw him or the waitress again. Not til the meal was over. Wow. We pretty much lost our appetite just from the service alone but the lack of taste and quality in the food didn't help either. Then to top it off, a huge gnat landed and was crawling around one of our biscuits. Yummy. Yeah it's safe to say I regretted going to this place. The food was bland, carb heavy and cold.

The waiter was quirky and funny, and also very friendly :) He recognized us the second time we came too (\"Oh, long time no see!\") We heard about the giant portions of Hash House, and we starved ourselves accordingly. Still, we could only order 3 plates for 6 people :\\ Be warned that there it is $2.50ish for every extra PLATE they put on the table for sharing! So with both days, we ordered:Chicken and waffles: AMAZING. A-MAAAAA-ZINGGGGGG!!!!!! We ordered this twice because it was so good! Big bacon strips cooked right INTO the waffle and sticking out at all sorts of delicious angles! Not too sweet to overpower, yet not too salty to be weird. YUM. I could eat a whole plate by myself! The chicken was not bad either, though alone I felt that it was a bit bland. The fried green onions around it also gave the dish a great zing!Chicken benedict: Not really a benedict, as there is no hollandaise sauce. Instead, it is a creamy chipotle sauce that my friends LOVED. They actually ordered extra sauce ($1.95) and cleaned it COMPLETELY. The benedict was very filling, but also good...I'm just not really sure what I ate aside from the chicken and the biscuit or something...Meatloaf: Holy mother of pearl this was GOOD! Meatloaf was tender and held together just right! The potatoes were also very delicious and the green beans were cooked to a nice delicate crunchy perfection! Carrots were meh, but no one's complaining with the rest of the dish! Tip: Meatloaf tastes ORGASMIC with the chipotle cream sauce!Chicken pot pie: This was very good as well. Light and a teensy bland/plain compared to the other dishes, but still good in its own right. My friend busted out the tabasco to spice it up, and I put in a bit more salt and pepper. Chicken was moist, and the chunks of potato and veggies were all cooked just right. Only thing was that the biscuit was hard as a rock. I think I finally broke one with my teeth and a part of the biscuit flew out and near hit the person across from me. I don't mind too much though as the rest of the dish (and the other dishes) were so good.Pancake, scrambled eggs, potatoes: The pancake is GIANT! The godfather of all pancakes! It was probably 5 normal IHOP pancakes (make that 6 or 7) clumped together and stacked with another 6 or 7 pancakes! Not as delicious as the waffle IMO, but definitely a WOW factor. The pancake had a good taste, but at some points it did feel like it was way too thick for me (not what she said). Not much to say on the eggs (they were normal?), but the potatoes had this weird crunchiness which made us wonder if it was leftover fried potatoes from breakfast/lunch...seemed to be re-fried or something. Both eggs and potatoes need more salt, but I honestly just wouldn't order this dish. Why get pancakes when you got CHICKEN AND WAFFLES?!?Overall? Mouthgasm. It was funny seeing my guy friends just put a bite in their mouth, sit back, and siiiiiiiiiiiiigh. Definitely come here when you stop by Vegas! Oh, and as for pricing...this was essentially all-you-can-eat as there was SO MUCH FOOD and you definitely need to share! Total for both times (again, 5-6 people, 3 dishes) came out to be around $15 WITH tip/tax+2 extra sauces.

When we finally got our meal, we were no longer hungry anymore. \u00a0The ham, spinach, and cheese scramble was alright, the country potatoes had this weird sour after taste that had such a bad taste in my mouth I didn't even want to finish them, and the crappy home-made biscuits tasted like hard chalk \u00a0No, it wasn't fluffy and buttery, but bland, hard, and completely devoid of taste. \u00a0I decided that this was definitely a 2 star Yelp experience. \u00a0I was so disgusted by the experience I actually felt the need to speak to Alonzo and the manager about how bad it was. \u00a0If the food had been good, the hour wait would have been worth it, but no, the wait was a complete waste of time. \u00a0While the portions are big, that just means big portions of more tasteless and bad food. \u00a0 \u00a0Alonzo was completely understanding and offered to discount our bill for us. \u00a0He understood why we were upset at the experience and did not BS us. I asked him if we could speak to the manager. \u00a0This manager guy was less than professional and gave us bullcrap excuses for why everything took so long. \u00a0Hey man, your employee already told us you were the reason the guys next to us got their food 30 minutes before we did. \u00a0Secondly, I've been here once before and the food didn't take nearly half as long as it did this time around. Just take responsibility for your actions and be honest. \u00a0He gave us a 30% discount on our food, but I don't think this was enough to want to return to this over-rated restaurant or recommend anyone to even waste their time going. \u00a0I'll just take it as a loss. \u00a0However, it was enough to bump up it from a 2 star experience to a 2.5 star experience. \u00a0 Despite all this, I don't recommend anyone to go here for breakfast. \u00a0The wait is too long for tasteless food. \u00a0Las Vegas is renowned for their world-class food, and this place isn't it, people.", "Date": "2013-05-13", "Author_Location": "Costa Mesa, CA"}, {"Author": "Hoang T.", "ReviewID": "uiWDq50AFS_rhNqWmdjU9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Think Man v.

Ever. My boyfriend & I saw this place on one of the tourist channels in the hotel and they mentioned it had been featured on Man vs. Food. Now, we both enjoy watching that show but have never had the opportunity to try one of the places where Adam has gorged himself so we knew that we simply had to try this place before we went back home. And in my opinion, it could not have been better.First, I had fairly low expectations for this place because it is in a pretty seedy looking casino on the strip. I mean, I had never even heard of the Imperial Palace let alone knew that it had such an awesome restaurant hiding inside. Also, it was known for having huge portions which typically means to me that the food is going to be just ok.I was totally wrong.The restaurant itself is actually very nice compared to the rest of the casino. It's really spacious and clean, and they play AWESOME music. Also, aside from your average orange juice, they offer tangerine juice. WHO ELSE DOES THAT!? No one, that's who.My boyfriend and I were already loving it just from those two things. For breakfast I ordered the Tractor combo which I got with two over easy eggs, sausage and the Brown Sugar Banana pancake.That's right. This was no boring old plain whatever pancake with some bananas sliced on top. This was a HUGE effing pancake with a beautiful crust of brown sugar goodness with at least two whole bananas cooked into the massive cake. OMFG.Drool. The delicately flavored moist and fluffy cake gently embraced the bananas as they were surrounded by delicious little pockets of crunchy brown sugar. I was a little closer to heaven with each bite. The eggs and sausage were also stellar, perfectly cooked with surprisingly very little grease. I was very impressed.My boyfriend chose the Man vs. Food favorite which was a ridiculous benedict of mashed potatoes and biscuits topped with fried chicken, scrambled eggs, mozzarella cheese and some veggies covered with a chipotle cream sauce. It was HUGE. Definitely the Frankenstein's monster of benedicts if I've ever seen it.It was also very tasty though. The chicken was delicious, again surprisingly not greasy at all. Especially for fried chicken. The chipotle cream was flavorful with a good amount of heat and all the veggies were super fresh. The service was also spectacular. Our waitress was super friendly and our food was brought out very promptly, even though she told us that our dishes may not come out at the same time. She told us they don't use heat lamps so they want everything to be served right when it comes out so it gets to you nice and hot. That is fine with me! This place definitely deserves all 5 stars. Great service, fantastic ambiance, amazing food and HUGE portions. I will for SURE be coming back to this place as soon as I can. I would even drive all the way out to Vegas again just to come to the Hash House, it's that good. Next time I HAVE to try the Chicken & Bacon Waffles. Yes. They have bacon waffles.

Four waffles beautifully arranged with two chicken breasts skewered on top, covered with shallots and other garnishes. The waffles didn't have too much syrup on them, which is exactly how I like it. To my surprise, there was bacon cooked into the waffles, which was a pleasant surprise. The chicken was pretty lightly fried, which I enjoyed as well. The crust was sweet, but not too sweet, which was a good contrast to the savoury chicken. Overall, a great must have experience if you've in Vegas, and not too pricey at all.

When we tried to order our entrees we were told that there was a charge for sharing (what?!). Thankfully, our waitress suggested that we order two entrees and two sides so we could bypass the nonsense charge. First off, my friend and I ordered morning cocktails: a pineapple champagne cocktail and a hibiscus. Unfortunately, the drinks were not good. Save the money, it's not worth it. Interesting menu tid-bit: Look up on their menu O'Hare of the Dog. Only in Vegas would they have that as a menu item. As far as entrees went, we ordered the House Smoked Fresh Salmon Hash and the Sage Fried Chicken Farm Benedict with two sides: Mac and Cheese and some vegetables. The Hash was actually not very good at all. I swear the salmon tasted like it came out of a can and it was super dry. We ended up picking at it throughout the \u00a0meal and didn't even finish it. Now the Farm Benedict on the other hand....AMAZING!!!! Hands down one of the best entrees I've had for breakfast EVER! I couldn''t stop eating it!

Mashed potatoes, biscuits, basted eggs, spinach, tomato and bacon topped with a roasted red pepper sauce. It was very esthetically pleasing, being huge and colorful with fried angel hair pasta sticking out if it and huge sprig of rosemary down the middle. Taste wise- meh. The red pepper sauce was virtually flavorless, the eggs were not seasoned, the biscuit was on the dry side. The mashed potatoes that it sat on top of were pretty much the best thing on the plate. There were only two slices of bacon on it also. The sides of the plate were smeared with Siracha. Wish the whole dish had been covered in it! My husband ordered eggs, sausage, and the apple cinnamon pancake. The pancake was huge and had at least half an apple worth of Granny Smith slices in it. Definitely better than my flavorless entree!

The wait was about 15-20 minutes.We knew the portions were huge and a doggy bag was not an option. So, we decided to share two dishes. But because they frown upon that, we ordered an additional side so they had no issue with three people chowing down on two entrees.We ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Brown Sugar Banana Flapjacks and a side of bacon. In addition, based on some other Yelp reviews, we ordered the Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade.The lemonade was super potent and overly sweet. Even after mixing thoroughly, it was way too much to drink straight. Since I had an unsweetened iced tea, we added a lot of that to the lemonade which made it bearable. Perhaps cutting it with a portion of water (or tea) would make it easier for most to drink.The Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles was made to be a visual showstopper. That was all. I was disappointed because I had been worked up by veterans of this dish. Sure, it was a monstrous pile of food with a huge steak knife and rosemary sprigs holding it together. Sure, it had bacon in the waffles. Sure, it had sage fried chicken. But my opinion went down as I started eating it. The chicken seemed overcooked and dry. I couldn't taste any sage. The waffles were more dense and the bacon didn't really add much. The bright note were the leeks which were very tasty, but not tasty enough to save this dish.The Brown Sugar Banana Flapjacks was really a single flapjack that was so huge it hung over the sides of the plate, and it was already a huge plate to begin with. The flavor was good and a great size to share between three people.I think the most memorable thing was the side of bacon. I was afraid that it would be overkill because there was bacon in the waffles. But this was thick cut hardwood smoked bacon so it was crispy and juicy and super flavorful. Probably some of the best, if not *the* best, bacon I've had.Parking at the Imperial Palace was a bit tricky since there weren't easily visible signs indicating that we were entering the IP garage. If you're not comfortable with driving along the strip, I would recommend taking the tram from another hotel on the strip to the IP.The amount of food you get is a plus, but if this is your first time, I would recommend going with a big group and ordering one chicken and waffles to share between everyone.

Yay, made it!Confused? Did I go to the wrong place? Is my memory failing me already? My second time (9/10/11) here within 24 hours, can't be. Service: Going to have to start with this vs. food. How can service differ so badly from one night to the next? Absolutely the most dreadful service. When we got there, there was NO host(ess) in sight. Patiently waited for about 15 minutes by reading the news prints. Then I started popping my head into the main seating area. Seen but not acknowledged by several employees: bartender and 2 waiters(tresses). Another 5-8 minutes pass... Now there is another party waiting with kids. FINALLY, an older male waiter with glasses quickly announces that someone would be with us shortly. He also asks where the hostess is and answers his own question by saying \"she's around so wait.\" Before we can say anything, he's gone. WTH?!? If I wasn't dying to try their food, we would have left. Darn you, taste buds and cravings. Okay, another 5 minutes pass. Two additional parties have joined at this time. Now, I'm irritated and hungry. Before, I could take action (my BF hates it when I do this), another gentlemen who just arrived about 2 minutes earlier walks into the main seating area and loudly states... \"Is anyone going to help us?\" A different waiter says someone will be with us and ushers the man back into the line. After another 2 minutes, a very apologetic waitress (old school glam girl, looks young with dark black hair) quickly seats us. She also makes excuses to us indicating the hostess must be in bathroom or something. About 32+ minutes to get seated.... 30 minutes before getting acknowledged. Our waitress didn't make up for it either. She was a tall, heavyset Caucasian with glasses. Our glasses were empty and NEVER refilled. I had to ask a busboy 2x for refills. She was prompt with the check though. Go figure. Food: Was it worth the wait? Yes, yes, yes... Almost an orgasm in the mouth. - Sage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles Large portion, definitely 2-3 could share. Very innovative dish form preparation to presentation. Better than Roscoe's, no doubt. Just like the host said the first night we came. Chicken was tender and flavorful. Waffles were perfectly cooked, fluffy and bacon stuffed. Green onions were deep-fried and surprisingly delicious... I couldn't stop eating them. The kicker though is the garnish dressing. There were 3-4 bites that had this amazing spicy kick. The dressing with maple syrup and the spice... OMG, to die for!! It was that good that I had to ask. I think the waitress was off though. She said it was the same as the rib place... soy-teriyaki sauce. But it wasn't, it was different in color and taste. I tried each drizzle multiple times to verify and it was definitely DIFFERENT. - Ribs (Small Plate) This was a just-enough serving. Succulent, savory, and it fell of the bone. Take note, this is the way ribs should be. It was accompanied with a simple potato salad with dill dressing. Very tasty. Parking: There is a garage available for parking. OVERALL First visit was waaaayyyy better than the first, service-wise. Honestly, I am still in utter shock of what a big difference my experience. I'm big on service. I'm a reasonable person, if it was busy, I would understand the wait. But considering the situation, it wasn't. Would I go back? As much as the service sucked, I would have to say \"YES,\" but maybe I'd try a different location. The food was extremely good. If I had to rate the food alone, it would have gotten 4.5 stars. For 5 stars, they need to make that spicy, maple garnish sauce for the chicken and waffles plate. No matter what... Even if food is awesome, if service sucks, rating will suck.--------------------------------------------------\u00ad------------------------------------**REVIEW BASED ON SERVICE ONLY... FIRST VISIT**On a recent Vegas trip, everyone was raving about the food here and said it was a \"must go.\" Then I saw it on tv when we were having some downtime, and the food just called to me. It actually made me salivate so we had to visit it.So the plan... Get the chicken and waffles. Location:There are multiple locations, this is one of four. Others are located at the M Hotel, Plaza Hotel, and off the strip.Menu:Be warned, there are DIFFERENT menus. \u00a0We hit it up pretty late, around 11:30pm. So that means, we made it for the LATE menu. So what sucks is that only select items are offered. Service:The host was pretty cool. He was down to earth and really informative.

The pre-glazed honey on top just made it that much more heavenly. We ordered chicken & waffles and country fried steak. The portions were so huge we just shared the chicken & waffles, leaving the country fried steak untouched (and for whatever reason, I thought it'd be a good idea to take it to go, knowing very well we were leaving at 7am the next morning). Prior to ordering we had asked the waiter how big the portions were and if he thought we'd be able to share. He recommended 2 portions just in case we were really hungry. Now, knwoing how ginormous the portions were and looking at the size of the two of us, you'd think he would've recommmended one portion only, but whatevs. The chicken and waffle was satisfactory. It's much preferred over Roscoes in my opinion (not a fan of soggy waffles). But I guess I'm not a chicken and waffles kind of gal. Honestly my review may be a little skewed in retrospect.

I just wanted to eat here really bad. Its at the Imperial Palace (weird hotel with lots of smokers), went left, right, south, north, couldn't find the place. Asked security for assistance, and bypassed a huge \"HASH HOUSE A GO GO\" sign above an escalator in the middle of the casino. This place does not disappoint. The proportions are HUGE. If you can't finish a $6 burger at Carl's Jr then split a plate with a friend. If you CAN finish a $6 burger at carl's jr then split a plate with a friend. They are GENEROUS with proportions. I was under the impression that it would be super expensive with outrageous prices, but NO i was wrong. Plates are from $11-$15, totally affordable. Its VEGAS, live it up. We ordered the meatloaf breakfast, HH delux (?) plate, and Andy's fried chicken benedict(as seen on Man V Food).Meatloaf tasted interesting, came out in a skillet with chunks of potatoes and vegetables with two huge biscuit. (I swear this restaurant is for people with big appetite and with 3 stomachs). Sister said she didn't like the meatloaf entree (too bad). Other sister ordered their GIANT pancake with sausages and scrambled eggs with a side of crispy potatoes. I mean GIANT pancake. I think it was 1 ft in diameter. It was HUGE, at least 1/4 inch thick. She of course didn't finish it. I ordered Andy's chicken and biscuit (i can't remember the name but as seen on Man V Food). SOO GOOD.HUGE biscuits with two huge fried chicken, on a bed of perfect mashed potates and strips of bacon and some special sauce. Don't forget to try their homemade JAM. Super delicious. Scoop some unto the biscuit or on some potatoes or on some mashed potatoes. Try the homemade jam. The table next to us were a party of 4 HUGE dudes. Macho douchebags with their artificial tan and muscles bulging from their tight ed hardy shirts. They could probably eat everything on the menu. Anyways, they all ordered burgers. They didn't finish it, and wrapped their half burgers to-go. Another table of big dudes order the chicken and waffles and had half their food boxed togo. So, A LOT of food. Not expensive. The hostess told us (a party of 4) would have to wait about 40 minutes, which was totally fine. Only a 30 minute wait, which flew by b/c we were reading the menu.

Also people that say the waffles are tough may not realize that there is a piece of thick cut bacon baked into the waffle. The maple reduction is good but I would have liked a little more. I did ask for additional syrup. I also sampled the chorizo jalepeno scramble. The eggs were fluffy and the chorizo was nice and spicy. The potatoes were well cooked and tasty.

Our server took our orders very quickly and brought us drinks right away, however, it took a while to get refills. It did take a while for our food to come out and when it did the scramble was brought out about five minutes before the two orders of chicken and waffles.

I politely asked the hostess if we could be seated, she nonchalantly escorted us in. The restaurant was deserted with only 2 parties left. We questioned our action, but, our waiter assured that we were fine and to take our time. We were thrilled by the prospect of dining at a restaurant that was featured on Man vs. Food.We hastily scoured the menu for dishes that were recommended by Man vs. Food. While flipping through it, my friend and I noticed nasty looks and rolling eyes from the hostess and other waiters. Our waiter came back and asked if we were ready. We said yes, but, asked if we were causing an inconvenience. He said, \"No, you guys are fine.\" I, then, ordered the sage fried chicken on bacon waffles, whereas, my friend got the rib-eye plate. We also ordered the bread pudding. When Mckinley (waiter) left, the stares and negative chatter continued and grew more intense as closing neared. The hostess, Jessica, made it blatantly obvious that she did not want us there by looking back repeatedly and rolling her eyes. Then, she would walk back and forth with a disgusted face. At that point, our excitement rapidly faded.While waiting for our dinner, we contemplated to either stay or take the food back to the hotel. We brought up the fact that we noticed obvious stares and rolling eyes, from the hostess and other employees. Mckinley, once again, reassured that we were just fine. A few minutes later, our dishes were served. The sage fried chicken on waffles with a knife stabbed through it, looked amazing. My friend's rib eye looked mouth watering. As he sliced through the steak, red liquid bled. My buddy requested medium well, not rare. I did not want to complain as I wanted to scurry the effin' out of there. However, the sight of blood oozing and thought of eating rare meat he just could not endure. So he politely asked Mckinley if he could microwave the steak or better yet, bring another steak cooked medium well. Mckinley surprisingly said we do not have a microwave. Now, what kind of restaurant does not have a microwave. My friend had every right to question the quality.Since Mckinley brushed us off with an obvious lie, we decided we had enough. My friend and I asked for boxes. Oh, our troubles only got worse. As our waiter brought the bill, I slipped the restaurant.com coupon with the check. Yes, I did mention at the beginning that I would be using a coupon. Well, he came back with a receipt for $62.54 (coupon not applied). With an, oops, I made a slight boo-boo look, our waiter said sorry and expected me to be fine with the charge. AND to use the coupon another time. Umm, really?! I am on vacation, doof. We came here with the intent of using the coupon. I, then, asked him if he could resolve the issue; either by refunding $25 back into my card and provide me with a second receipt. Or void the transaction and hand me a voided receipt. Then, charge my card the correct amount (coupon applied). Mckinley, with a deer in headlights look, said he would get in touch with someone. His manager quickly came over and explained in a not so apologetic manner that the right amount would be charged and the incorrect amount will fall off. Keeping my emotions in check, I asked for a copy of the first charge. He vehemently denied my request. I asked him again, stating I want peace of mind if the first charge does not fall off that I have proof to provide to my bank. The manager quickly dismissed my request and walked away. What a JERK! In a situation like this, any consumer knows to retain a receipt for dispute purpose (if you get double-charged). You simply cannot go off of someone's word. When Mckinley came back with the correct amount charged, I asked him for the first receipt. He gladly handed me the copy. How hard was that. Manager, FAIL!Bottom line:I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone regardless of the quality of food. A business is there to make money and promote its brand. The hours that are stated to the public, are the hours you as an employee fully acknowledge. If you do not agree, then, why work there. I, myself, work in an industry where there is closing time. Yes, it sucks when a customer comes in last minute as they could potentially make you stay way past your working hours. But, I DO NOT make it known through facial expressions that you are not welcomed. Remember, you are promoting the brand; you are the face of the company. You, as an employee, are there from the hours you are scheduled; plus over-time if it applies. Do not give me this BS that it is rude to come in half an hour or even 5 minutes before closing. It is part of your job. If leaving early is what you expect every day or complaining is what you do when a customer comes in late (regardless if you work at a restaurant, retail store or bank), then, get the hell out and find another job.

I get mine stuffed with cheddar & bacon (skipping the avocado), one of three varieties. It comes with a steak knife and a sprig of sage stuck on the top. Tip: Use the knife; you cannot eat this burger whole. The burger is good beef, cooked just right. The side of fries is huge and they are cooked just right. The drizzle of BBQ sauce and the sticks of something add a nice touch. All-in-all, a burger, fries, and a lemonade will run you just over $20 (with tip) and will leave you with a good taste on your tongue, a warm feeling on your belly, and no need to eat for the rest of the day.

I passed on the overpriced OJ to keep the cost below $15, but once again, this is a meal that can last you the day. Hash House dies not try to be pretentious, like so many Strip establishments. It's hearty food, and while the prices seem Strip-like (that is, 50% higher just because it's in Vegas), the amount you get easily justifies the prices (at least for the food; they must make their nut on drinks, where even soda prices are stratospheric).

There are way too many great things I can say about this establishment, so I'll stick to my favorites:-- The obscure, one-of-a-kind menu: They don't just do chicken and waffles, they do Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles. They don't just do a hash or a scramble, they put together a work of art with fried chicken, bacon, hash browns, cheese, eggs, lettuce and tomato on a plate with the most delicious gravy sauce you'd ever taste on a big ole plate.-- The service: Every waiter and waitress is trained to LOVE what they do. Either that, or they literally cherish their craft. They are psyched to be your waiter and to get you your food as fast as possible.-- No heat lamps: When food is finished, it's brought out to your table immediately. They don't wait for everyone's food to be prepared and then bring it out and 1 or 2 dishes are cooler. It should be done this way at every restaurant.-- Artwork: Across the restaurant, celebrities has signed menus and given them feedback about how perfect their menu is. And those celebrities are right.This is a restaurant in which the food speaks for itself. Man Vs. Food's Adam Richman recently visited and showed how perfect this institution is. It's almost unbelievable how food can have this much flavor. My girlfriend's pancake was as big as a large pizza and tasted like it was injected with flavor.

Sorry KFC. \u00a0The seasonings in the batter was perfect and the maple made the chicken breast so tender. The chicken was sitting on top of 4 bacon strips that topped a mountain of thick mashed potatoes.

I added a couple of pork sausage links because I didn't really that they made plates to feed mountain men. But those were really good also.

The Sage Fried Chicken being the restaurant's signature dish seemed like it should be the best dish. However, all that arrived was a heaping mound of mash potatoes (very cheap carbohydrates once again) covered by greens and a pair of biscuits with a fried chicken breast steak. The chicken breast was so dry that the fibers were distinctly frazzled after a bite and tough enough to compete with jerky. The burger that came was clearly overcooked and consisted of low-quality ground beef and over-sized buns. Incessant praise for large portions at this restaurant seem misguiding in that only the cheapest components of each dish are liberally given while the main components (the protein and pricier ingredients) are sparse and low quality.

First, let me say that this restaurant proudly represents what Vegas stands for. The food is big..Huge... And ultra... \u00a0I mean ULTRA tasty. When I draft a review, I comment on 3 areas: Food, service, and price. The service was decent... Above average, but not over the top. The servers we experienced were attentive and friendly. Some were rather unique looking but hey, that's Vegas. One thing I liked was that everyone we talked to acted as if they were happy and proud to work there. I like that! The atmosphere was very casual and the place was a bustling with activity. I was happy and comfortable.The food....WOW...the food. \u00a0OK, it took me quite some time to decide what to order. \u00a0Everything on the menu looked good! \u00a0So did the plates of food I saw passing by! \u00a0I ended up ordering the fried chicken benedict...a Man vs. Food favorite. \u00a0It did not disappoint. \u00a0In one word: Unbelievable. \u00a0This place prides themselves on twisted farm food. \u00a0The portions were HUGE and the taste was outstanding! \u00a0My girl ordered the brown sugar and banana pancake. \u00a0It was the size of a medium pizza! \u00a0It tasted so good that you would need to sit down to eat it. \u00a0This is simply no joke. \u00a0My only regret is that I didn't get to try other things on the menu. \u00a0If you are in a party of 4, I would highly recommend ordering 3 totally different breakfasts and then sharing them. \u00a0This would allow you to try different things and you would in no way be short on food. \u00a0This restaurant definitely did deliver in every sense of the word. \u00a0BOOYAH!The price was amazingly reasonable for Vegas. \u00a0It was priced similar to IHOP but with all the huge portions and pizazz of a meal you cant get just anywhere. \u00a0For the two of us it was 28 dollars with drinks! \u00a0We did order too much food though as neither of us could finish. \u00a0My taste buds wanted more but my stomach simply couldn't handle another bite!I just love this place. \u00a0I am glad we found it and I cant wait to go back the next time I visit Las Vegas.", "Date": "2013-01-11", "Author_Location": "Corona, CA"}, {"Author": "Charlie M.", "ReviewID": "aa-Re6HV3AC4QyzJL2o6jA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went here specifically for the ridiculously huge serving of rosemary fried chicken and bacon waffles. \u00a0My recommendation is to plan on eating half or sharing with your party. \u00a0However, all the other dishes are massive as well so unless you come with a party that shares the same purpose, do not plan on sharing. \u00a0Once I finished laughing at the size of the the dish and decided to actually try and eat some I realized I needed a plan of attack. \u00a0So I moved the chicken to one side of my dish and the waffles to the other. \u00a0Then I proceeded to cut a piece of chicken, a piece of waffles and then put them together to consume. \u00a0I was certainly a fan and like the salty sweet combination of the fried chicken bacon and waffle with syrup. \u00a0Despite my effort I could not finish the dish and took the rest to eat on the way to Zion Canyon National Park (by the way, it should be consumed immediately as the chicken is not as crunchy and and the waffles too mushy after sitting in a to go box). \u00a0I will try to come back when in Vegas, but it is about a 15 minute drive from the strip and certainly not walking distance. \u00a0So I will most likely visit on my way out of Vegas rather than during my stay when I enjoy to walk everywhere I go.", "Date": "2013-05-07", "Author_Location": "Aliso Viejo, CA"}, {"Author": "Nissan S.", "ReviewID": "g1yQcyYzilDYYgnfpqclXQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After you're seated (1 hour wait on a Saturday afternoon), there's an additional 30-40 minutes until your food is served from the time you order.

This city is overflowing with buffets designed to make your waist, well, overflow, and Hash House can easily provide that feeling with a single item. The fact that very few things on their menu even exceed the $15 mark is pretty impressive, but maybe that's why everything presented looks ostentatious but winds up just rather banal... an embodiment of Las Vegas as a whole, perhaps.Style over substance certainly seems to be the modus operandi for Hash House, delivering mammoth sized meals you can't help but go \"wow!\" over, and yet very few people leave with empty plates, more likely because they simply got tired of eating surprisingly bland food, rather than being simply outmatched in the stomach capacity department. I watched multiple diners get up from the bar stools next to me leaving half or even three-quarters of a plate full of food behind. I guess when the prices are this low, in Vegas, you figure that the minimal investment isn't really worth the excessive calories.That's all in retrospect though... I came to Hash House because I had heard tales of monolithic food combinations so loaded with flavor that they had attracted multiple food related television shows to their establishments, including a chicken and waffle dish stacked so high that it approached eye level. Without going on too much of a rant about how these shows often lead so many people astray, I'll just say that the size (yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1\u2026) is definitely impressive, but we all know it's what you do with it that counts. Somewhat ironically I had actually used their sage fried chicken and bacon loaded waffles as inspiration for a recent brunch party I hosted, and I can honestly say that I put Hash House to shame. What absolutely makes fried chicken is the skin, and if you've got limp, soggy skin, then your size doesn't much matter. This chicken could have been baked for all I know, as there was zero crispness to it. Add to that waffles that, aside from the bacon slices inside, are generally bland, and one tiny ramekin of syrup to assist, and I can see why people literally just got tired of eating this. I also gave their BLT Bloody Mary a try, thinking the ingredients would be well infused into the drink, considering that it was by far the most expensive on the menu, but instead I wound up with what essentially amounts to a sandwich shoved into a drink (yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1\u2026), with no clear way on the best way to either eat or drink it. I wound up having to sip and nibble like a freaking rabbit on what has to be the clumsiest cocktail idea I've ever seen executed. After having the variations prepared by Brian, Nicole, and Gregg at my Bloody Mary Battle, this seemed outright amateurish. I should have stuck with my original intuition, passed on the alcohol, and gave the S'Mores latte a go... although if this was any indication it would have been the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man shoved into a teacup with a box of Graham Crackers on the side and someone who comes along and projectile vomits Hershey's chocolate syrup in my face.", "Date": "2012-06-29", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "Andrew B.", "ReviewID": "tpi7g0CWq8ZZHZ3cBdJAXg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Holy crap Batman!This place was amazing!

The short version: Rejected dive hotel buffet scraps recycled at a Hash House A GO GO.There were 6 of us in town for my bachelor party weekend. As a fan of San Diego's Hash House I happened to convince my party to check out HH LV at the Imperial House. The service was the absolute worst with the consensus on the food being mediocre (mediocre only because some had nothing to compare Imperial Palace Hash House to). It was so bad that I need to write a review.Here's how it went:Fist, ever sit for breakfast after a night of hardcore binging only to yell your order to the server? The loud music became very apparent when the waitress felt compelled to ask, \"huh,\" \"what was that,\" \"can you repeat that,\" for just about all six of us at the table. This was a problem for the hung over amongst us. Next, a friend whom doesn't eat meat asked for a substitution for the ham, sausage and/or bacon options. She politely says to him, \"No, I'm sorry. We don't really substitute here. Usually people will order their food and just not eat the meat.\" The friend of mine follows with, \"soooo, no fruit... nothing?\" \"No,\" she replies, \"sorry.\" This was a bummer for a person who's never experienced the real deal Hash House. Sadly, it continues downhill.We order our food. I got the Basic Breakfast which included eggs (I asked for over-medium) with bacon, potatoes and a side of biscuits and gravy (layoffa me I was starving!!). A couple people ordered the chicken (dry) and waffles while others had omelets and various other items. Two of us receive partial meals while others had complete orders delivered. At this point in time, the ice water's are dry while our server is MIA (she was overly chatty with the two/three tables she serviced). I received my side of biscuits and gravy and continued to wait for the rest of my food. Two others at the table sat without any food or water. Then the rest of my food comes. Low and behold, the eggs were undercooked (perhaps she would have heard me say over-medium had the music not been so loud?). The clear slime made the eggs inedible. The bacon was tiny, shriveled and cold (SD HH is huge, thick-cut deliciousness). The potatoes were not Hash House rosemary style potatoes. Rather, they were dive-bar buffet status potatoes that sat under a heat lamp for hours and far too hot to eat. Then, I discovered the clear like gelatin chunks in the only thing I thought to be edible, the biscuits & gravy. This was utterly disgusting. Meanwhile, as most of us are more than half-way through our breakfasts, we realize two of us at the table had yet to receive their meals.Finally, our server breaks away from her story telling at other tables to check on us. I informed of the two missing meals. She runs in to check in the kitchen and comes back with our order slip and asks us what we're missing.

I wish I hadn't. I ordered the fried chicken eggs benedict. They stay true to the fat/grease/carbs/bacon formula. This behemoth has a bed of grilled mashed potatoes topped with dry biscuits, layered with the slimiest, uncrispiest bacon, topped with flavorless fried chicken, then finally over-sauced with a bland chipotle cream sauce. As you can tell from my description. I hated this dish. That is putting it mildly. This dish has never heard of contrasting textures. This dish has one texture, which is MUSH. Everything is mushy and dry. The bacon might've been crisp before, but when sandwiched between biscuit and chicken it just got slimy. It was almost the texture of raw bacon. You want the crunch of fried chicken? Not here. The Chicken is just over smothered in the chipotle sauce and just makes the breading soft and mushy. The portion was huge. Don't even think about taking the rest to your hotel room unless you have a fridge. This thing spoils with a quickness.

Not to mention, the service was spectacular on both visits. Our group of 10 dined at Hash House twice for breakfast while in Vegas over Christmas. Staying at the Flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the Imperial Palace and up the escalator dedicated to Hash House. Getting to the restaurant before 9AM both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. The restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10AM. Our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. For me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. While the food was VERY good, being The Griddle cafe fanatic that I am, I cannot give Hash House 5 stars. Their pancakes (snickers) and french toast did not compare to the deliciousness that is The Griddle. BUT, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is note worthy. Perfectly Fried Chicken breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best fried chicken I recall having (although I rarely eat fried chicken). The waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. This was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. The maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and I recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. It was just YUM! My boyfriend and I split the dish and it was perfect for two people. The next visit we split the french toast which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. The banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. It went well with the french toast. Many people at our table went with the Tractor Special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. No one tried their hash, sadly. Any meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, DO IT! Our server was nice enough not to charge to $2.50 split plate charge. I do think that Hash House is a \"Must-Go\" while in Vegas.

The urban/farm type decor is different, but well kept and clean. The food here is an experience to say the least. The menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as the O'Hare of the Dog which is a 14oz Budweiser and a side of bacon! Or the BLT Bloody Mary. They are known here for their Fried Chicken and Waffles which are extreme for sure. Please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. The service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of \"punk rock\" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. I never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..But I did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. The home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right I said GIRTH!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. This went the same for their signature \"hashes\" for breakfast. The \"crispy potatoes\" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...I had the \"Smoked Salmon\" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes I could have hoped for...Although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change.

I bite into my deep fried chicken breasts and was underwhelmed to say the least. Batter was soggy, not crispy with the resounding crunch I had imagined. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and moved on to the waffles, hoping that Hash House would redeem themselves here. But alas, I was disappointed yet again.

The restaurant was also a little tricky to find inside the actual casino, but once we figured out where we were going, we were good to go. If there is one word I can use to describe the food here: hugemongous. But that's also leaving out how delicious it is. I ordered the meatloaf with BBQ sauce, and it was DIVINE. Seriously, I wanted to buy a gallon of it and take it home despite how hard it would have been to get it through airport security. I ordered like three extra serving cups of it. The meatloaf sandwich was rich and buttery, and served with a steak knife because it was so freakin' massive. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it or take it back to our hotel, so I had to leave about 1/2 to 2/3 of it on my plate. Sad. My mom ordered the Pacer's Hash, and it smelled awesome. Our friend Tiffany, who wasn't that hungry, thought it smart to just order a couple of sides, and chose the loaded cheese and bacon mashed potatoes and a side salad. WOAH.

But luckily, a couple tables freed up earlier, and the hostess took us in halfway through our wait. We had to split up into two adjacent tables to go in earlier, but we didn't mind if it meant getting seated earlier.Because I was so hungry, everything sounded so good and I had a hard time deciding what to get. I ultimately decided to get the Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles since it was one of their special dishes. I also got the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade.- Yes, the portions are large. My dish was definitely big enough for two. I guess it's kind of a novelty, but they must waste a lot of food here. Most people probably get their own dish and aren't able to finish, which of course means it gets dumped into the trash. I feel like it would be more economical for both parties if they served smaller portions and charged a little less.- The Sage Fried Chicken & Waffles were good, though. The sage flavor took the chicken up a notch from being your standard fried chicken. The waffles were cooked perfectly, and the pieces of bacon embedded in the waffles added a nice dimension to them without overwhelming with bacon flavor. If you're a fan of chicken and waffles, I think this dish is worth a try.- Definitely get the Watermelon Kiwi Lemonade! It was delicious! And it's so pretty when it first comes out. :)Something funny about this place... They stick a sprig (or a few) of rosemary into everything. Just look around. Everything has a long sprig of rosemary sticking out of it. They must have a big basket of them in the kitchen that every dish passes by...Despite the food being pretty good, I didn't leave this place feeling particularly great.

I use to visit NV every 6 months but as i grew older my body can no longer keep up with the played out hype. One of my must haves/do's when i visit is HASH HOUSE A GO GO! Word of advice cancel any dinner plans you have that evening for you will be leaving with left overs. My girls and i have a ritual where we eat there for breakfast and take our heaping loads of left overs back to the hotel and eat the remainder for dinner while we soak our screaming feet from all the walking on the strip in our jacuzzi in our room. My sister had the CHICKEN POT PIE, and my jaw dropped when i saw it. That thing was bigger than my head and trust me thats pretty big! I couldn't help myself i took a bite and the crust of the pie was delicious. \u00a0You can tell they don't short you on butter because the crust was so crispy and buttery.. I need to move on or i may never stop talking about it.I decided to try the CHICKEN AND WAFFLES since their menus put soo much emphasis on it. I would be lying if i said i totally loved it. It came with reduction syrup that i wasn't too much of a fan of for i felt it compromised the flavor a bit. Don't get me wrong the dish was good i guess i just played it up too big in my head. My girls each had a meal from their HASH selection and they loved what they got i just can't remember which ones they chose.

I understand why the bacon is cooked into the waffle. The chicken had a greasy, bland crust and the interior of the chicken was dry and awful. The person I was with had a scramble, or ugly omelet. It tasted ok once you got past the fact that they whipped all of the fillings into the mound of eggs. This came with a biscuit as big and dense and dry as a hockey puck.

We ordered the Turkey special (this being Thanksgiving lunch) as well as the fried sage chicken special made famous by the Man vs. Food show -- recommended by our waitress. Both were fair to middlin' on the taste side but did not live up to the hype. Our total bill for two entrees came up to about $55 after all taxes and a 20% tip.My criticism hinges on two small but critical issues concerning their policy.My wife wanted biscuits or bread to hold us over the (waitress promised) forty minute ordering wait (after the half hour seating wait). We were given one (one!) lone biscuit but later found that we were charged $4.50 for this one lone biscuit. Had we known biscuits cost $4.50 each at this place -- we wouldn't have ordered them. Most nice restaurants will _NOT_ charge you for bread or biscuits (including say a certain nice food outlet from the 'Outback' where we had lunch the day before). I am still amazed that even after I discussed this politely with a manager -- he stood his ground on charging us. So -- don't order biscuits \u00a0while waiting unless you want to pay $4.50 each. You've been warned...Second -- I noticed that the hugeness of the portions were primarily due to overly generous (and inexpensive) helpings of mashed potatoes, mashed yams and multiple examples of the formerly mentioned biscuits accompanying the 'good' parts (chicken, beef etc.).

I was eagerly anticipating my visit and even had spoken with my colleagues about going. We were staying at the Flamingo so the location was ideal for us to visit for breakfast. There were 12 of us that went in and when told it was a 40 minute wait 8 decided to go elsewhere. The remaining 4 decided we would wait; you only get to Vegas so often; right? We waited for 40 minutes and we were finally seated. Everything is okay so far. The menu looked fantastic and I had already made up my mind I was having the chicken and waffles. I could not wait!! We ordered coffees and water and then our meals. The menu states clearly \"please be patient, everything is made from scratch and can take time to prepare\"; I am more than okay with this. I am willing to wait for fabulous, fresh food. This is where things began to deteriorate rapidly. Our waitress while bubbly was inattentive or inefficient at her occupation or both. We asked for refills on coffee; after waiting for 10 mins for her to notice we needed more. She said that she had some brewing. Okay, no problem. Two seconds later my wife notices other servers pouring coffee for their customers. After another 5 mins we wave her down again and ask for more coffee. She says \"sure!\" as if the previous request never happened. Several minutes later the coffee finally came. Water glasses were never refilled without having to track someone down and ask. Same with the coffee. This went on for 40-45 mins while waiting for food. The food finally started to come out. First was my wife's pancake. A couple of minutes later the french toast came out for one of us and then a few minutes later the BLT that was ordered; sans the fries. Then a few minutes after that my chicken and waffles came out. Now as I stated I am cool with the 40 minute wait for fresh food; but in that time frame you should be able to get an entire table of four all served at the same time. So, we all start to dig in. My wife's pancake is huge and looks great. They gave her a thimble full of syrup for a pancake that is the size of Texas. No problem; just ask for more. We had to ask again after it never came. My dining companions were enjoying the french toast and the BLT. Still no fries. I was taking on the chicken and waffles. They did not come with any syrup. They did come with a \"maple reduction sauce\" unfortunately it was reduced to nothing. The waffles were good and had bacon in the middle but they were dry without the necessary syrup to get them down. Asked for syrup again. Waited. It finally came. My friend was done with the BLT. No fries...asked for them and they finally came out. Asked for more coffee and water. Waited. Finally got it. So as you can imagine our table discussion this entire time has been how disappointed we all have been with our experience. My friend Mark finally asked for the manager and voiced his concerns with our experience. The manager apologized and left. A few minutes later Mark caught him again and asked for his business card and said \"I'm a letter writer\". The manager gave him the card and then came back to the table and took his BLT and the drinks off of the bill. Smart move. Took a little prodding but it was a smart move. We could not wait to pay and get out. I would not make the effort to go back. My new name for this place is \"Hash House A No Go\" and I will leave it at that.

She said she'll get me a new one. The waffle, on the other hand was good, except the little tin cup of syrup was placed on the waffle itself.

They have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. Guess there were large groups outside. But by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. Anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. I already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. The guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. Hahaha. So I split the house hash with chicken. It was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. We were starving but it was so much food. The two of us had trouble finishing it. It wasn't that amazing either. The food is just ok. I don't know if I love it or will crave it in the future. It's a little bit greasy. I think their gimmick is just huge portions and I guess their food presentation is pretty good. My friend got the Andy's sage fried chicken eggs benedict (which is a Man vs Food fav) but man it's like almost a foot high, everything piled on top of each other. Looked really good. I only tried a bit of the mashed potatoes and chicken and hollandaise sauce. It was tasty. That dish was like $16 though. Everything is about $15 or more but I guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok.

City) and Travel Channel (Man vs. Food and Food Paradise). We got the Sage fried Chicken and waffles. Just so we're clear, I totally forgot about this, but bacon is cooked into the waffle. I repeat the bacon is in the waffle. Four waffles piled on each other, with two pieces of fried chicken at the top skewered by a stick of sage, covered with fried leeks and drizzled with maple syrup (Don't worry syrup lovers, they also give you a little dish of more syrup). Fried Chicken and Waffles are my jam, I don't like eggs so I don't have a lot of breakfast foods I do like, but this combines the best of not just both worlds, but all worlds. The chicken was moist and juice, had a fantastic crisp noise when you broke into it. And the waffles, crisp enough with slabs of bacon just hanging out. All combined with maple syrup and you have a winning combination. We heeded many warnings and split it between two of us. Because of that we also allowed ourselves a side of crispy potatoes, which were good, just paled in comparison to whatever else we had going on on our tastebuds.
