The beer selection at this restaurant is great; though that being said, you can get that great selection a ton of places now, and for a better price.My wife and I went here yesterday for our 2 year anniversary. It started off wonderful with some excellent drink, and an amazing appetizer. I was told about the special, a Walleye with an amazing sounding salad and I decided to go for it. When the food came it was so incredibly salty I couldn't eat it. Now, I will admit that I am sensitive to salt, so I had my wife try it, and she agreed with me. My plan was to send it back and get something else, but it took the waitress over 7 minutes to get back to our table. In that time the people sitting next to us sent a dessert back because it was too salty (a dessert!). By the time she got back my wife's food was gone, otherwise it would have been cold. Then it took an additional 5 minutes or so for my wife's wine to show up that she had ordered when our food was delivered. At this point we were hoping it wouldn't come because I just wanted to leave so that I could go eat some real food. Eventually it did come, and we drank it and tried to get out of there, but we had to track down our waitress again because she was avoiding us (or so it seemed).When it comes down to it, I guess I should not expect great food from this place. The beer is what I should have come for. But, that being said what sort of put a damper on my evening wasn't necessarily the bad food, but the way that it was handled. I get it that it sucks that two tables next to each other had the same problem, but that doesn't mean you can avoid the situation. You can be polite, energetic, and apologize. Overall this was a very disappointing experience, and I am very frustrated as I often recommend this place to friends, and have even brought friends from out of the country to here as an excellent example of how Chicago does beer and appetizers (at least).", "Date": "2014-07-01", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Katie W.", "ReviewID": "3xq_fCYS6M-ZdJcf47GNxA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm kind of not into beers, but I'm really into cider beers.

Ordered the charcuterie plate for an appetizer with duck liver mousse, prosciutto, and \u00a0summer sausage. Summer sausage was standard and not anything special, the duck liver mousse was melt in your mouth excellent and served with toasted bread.I ordered the steak frites for my main dish and the bf ordered the mussels with chorizo. The mussels were tough and overly salty. The only flavor was in the chorizo and that wasn't even very good, just hot. The mussels were also gritty like they weren't washed properly. I ordered my steak medium and it came out way over cooked and cold. My frites were also cold as well. Our food was dropped off and no one came to check on us for at least 25 minutes.

Beer Choices for the lady: Three Floyds Zombie Dust & Goose Island The Ogden. Beer Choice for the man: Goose Island Bourbon Country Vanilla Stout----FROM 2010!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u00ad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u00ad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Appetizer: Charcuterie Trio: Rabbit Liver Mousse, Country Duck Pate & Pork Rilette.Entrees: Organic Montreal-Style Brisket Sandwich (hubby) & Duck Reuben Sandwich (Wifey) both served with their signature frites & aioli. Dessert: Lavender Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Pistachios, Blackberries, Lemon Curd & Graham Cracker. Dinner started off lovely, we were offered a seat @ the \"kitchen bar\" with no wait time- pretty awesome for 8pm on a Saturday night. Having worked in a restaurant before (wifey) it was pretty awesome to be that close to the guys \"on the line\" making the food we were going to be eating shortly. Hubby went straight to the beer list and hugged me immediately due to his over excitement from the awesome selection of beers on draft. He was also drawn to the \"Off Menu\" Beer in the pad-locked beer cooler near our table. We ordered our 1st round of beer, Zombie Dust for me & thankfully hubby asked if they had anything off menu, our server Dan recommended the Bourbon Country Vanilla Stout, which happens to be hubby's FAVOURITE. Upon discovering it was from 2010 (the only year this variety was made) there was only one option- to order it :) The appetizer selections were great, we were really happy with the country pate & pork rilette; however, the mousse selection our server recommended (because it was on special) was sub-par. It had a weird goatcheesey texture and was our least favorite. It would have been nice if we had some extra crustini pieces for our plate but we survived. We were really excited about brisket & duck; however, both were somewhat disappointing. The Duck Reuben had very little actual duck, sauerkraut or any of the other items supposedly on the sandwich. It did have an abundance of gruyere which i was happy with but that was about it. Maybe the brisket wasn't supposed to come with any sauce, lord knows it didn't have any. The bread was plain and it was smothered in whole grain mustard (NOT LISTED ON THE MENU) hubby was upset to say the least. Both of our sandwiches came with their signature frites- as a potato connoisseur i wouldn't rank these high on my personal list. They were overly salted-over-ly-salt-ed.... SALTEDDDDDDD!! Hubby felt as though his tongue was \"assaulted\" har har- do you get it? Anywho- the Goose Island Ogden I (wifey) had with my entree was the saving grace- it was the first time I've had this type of beer and it was really yummy. I will definitely be ordering it again :) The unlikely hero of this meal (outside of the beer of course) was actually dessert. The lavender really came through the taste of the panna cotta which just melted in your mouth. The pistachios, blackberries, lemon curd & graham cracker melded perfectly with this dish, needless to say- we almost licked the plate! Hubby (the beer connoisseur) said this paired perfectly with the Bourbon County Vanilla Stout :) Overall a good experience, we'll be back. The atmosphere is fun, loud but not obnoxiously so. Next time we might explore the entree menu, mussels, prawns & more pate, will definitely steer clear of the sandwiches, and will absolutely do our best to save room for dessert :)", "Date": "2014-05-18", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Dave S.", "ReviewID": "j2ZTDqyf1JGG28GPgISebA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We came here for beers on a Friday night, 3 of us, great service and drink selection.

Also my parents were visiting from overseas, we'd been going on about how fab the mussels are at the Hopleaf and we lived super close at the time, we ordered drinks and two orders of the mussels to share. 45 mins later we checked on our food and they had forgotten to put the order in by that point the kitchen was closed. Now we were all starving but we didn't complain but wanted to make sure the food wasn't on the bill. Omg.. what a drama! The server firstly didn't apologize for his mistake but then proceeded to snap and say it was our fault for not following up earlier! There's been a few other issues but I'll stop ranting.

Had been turned onto this place by numerous people through out the Chicago area, so I had to make the stop. First of all, we came here for the beer. We heard they had Angels Share on tap, so it was worth the cab ride to get there, and get home safely. The Angels Share (Brandy barrel) was fantastic, and not overly priced. It was a small sized glass, 6 oz. for four dollars. I wont argue with that. They had some really nice sours on tap, and some other greats in the bottle. Not an overwhelming huge selection of tap beers (quite a few), or bottle beers, but concise and quality. Some real thought went into what to carry and what not to carry.We sat in the loft style upstairs, over looking the dining room below us. Busy, busy place. We were seated right away, and was happy to be upstairs rather than down. We had a nice lil corner table, out of the way, where we could discuss our beer and food, and not feel like we were in the way. We had the charcuterie sampler, and it was fanstic. The food was a bit pricey. The tap beers seemed moderately to a bit over priced, but they can get away with because of the selection. I will return for sure.

I mean I understand it's a bar establishment, but it's also a restaurant and people chose to order drinks at their table, the servers and bartenders should really be checking them. Oh well, I won't overly fuss about that topic.While we were waiting for our friends to join us, we got some drinks at the bar. I asked for a blue moon but better recommendation and I got the Mort Subite from Brussels which was mildly tart, refreshing and fruity without fruit. That beer alone was able to hit me hard, but it was very tasty and pricier than most of their beers here for $8.00. My hubby got some blondie ale beer, not sure which one, but that one was just okay. But there overall selection is huge, get the one I got and you won't be disappointed but there's definitely lots to choose from if you are picky.Now onto the food, I saw that they had the quail as an appetizer on their online menu so I was really excited to try it. Kinda a fail since they didn't have it in the restaurant, well you probably should update your menu then. We shared the duck reuben sandwich on toasted marble rye bread with their homemade sauerkraut and cranberry cream cheese. It was okay, nothing to rave about, looked better than it tasted type of thing, but a huge portion served with yummy pommes frites.Now the reason why you should come to Hopleaf bar and the only reason I bumped this establishment up from 3 to 4 stars is: the MUSSELS! Wow, I've had mussels in many places in Chicago, all over the US and even Brussels, and these were just fantastic, literally some of the best I've had, plump and for a single portion for $13 it's literally enough for two, but you should really enjoy and get the portion for 2 for $22. Plus, you get a huge helping of fries with it with a garlic mayo making it super yummy. Definitely a place to come to on a chilly night for Beer, mussels and fries. The service was okay as well, no real complaints there. Dessert menu didn't impress me and we were full from all those mussels so we skipped it this time.

Here are some of my thoughts, first regarding the food:Fries - still the best I can find in Chicago. Very thin, very tasty, and the side of mayo complements the fries nicely. They're very salty though, so stay away if that's not your thing. It's a big serving, so keep that in mind, especially if you order a plate that comes with even more fries. It's easy to be overwhelmed by the fries if you're not careful ordering.Baby Octopus - a newer offering. Delicious. The lemon/chorizo aioli goes a long way. Accompanying fava beans are also great. A huge appetizer - sometimes I order this as my meal.Belgian-Style Mussels - a Hopleaf mainstay. Also delicious, and the mussel broth is excellent for absorbing into bread and even the accompanying fries.Brisket Sandwich - I don't know what happened here. I used to order it all the time because the brisket was fall-apart-brisket that had nice char on the sides and was deliciously fatty. Now it's dry and uninteresting. I don't order it anymore.CB&J - cashew butter, fig jam, and raclette cheese. It's like a grilled cheese sandwich with other tasty toppings added. It is delicious and I order it about half the time. However, I always find the side of stilton macaroni to be surprisingly bland, considering stilton is such a sharp cheese.Toasted Ham Sandwich - ham with gruyere on pumpernickel. Surprisingly good, but very heavy. I usually love it, but it has been slightly less delicious as of late (the ham in particular - might be because of their move from Nueske to house-cured). Comes with a side of fries that is about the size of a cat.Beer - always excellent with a good assortment of Belgians and American micro beers. I tend to like the stronger beers that come in half pints or snifters and Hopleaf never disappoints. Service - good and straightforward, though some newcomers might be put off by the slight cantankerousness of some of the bartenders. Don't order Miller or Vodka-Red-Bull (they don't have either), which I've witnessed a couple of times - you'll likely be scowled at (kind of funny from my point of view). They are fairly helpful if you have a question.Ambiance - it can get a little crowded, but it's a great place to take a date (in my opinion) and have good conversation. No annoying televisions. Good background jazz music, good layout, good tables as long as you can get one.I will happily continue being a regular at this place.

We also split a butternut squash curry soup, diver scallops, an order of onion rings, and an onion tartlet. The onion rings were over salted and greasy and the onion tartlet was overcooked. Sad face. The soup however, was amazing. Slightly spicy, full of flavor, and very creamy. The highlight for me was the roasted cauliflower salad - best salad I've eaten in a long time. I loved the mix of the raisins, Marcona almonds, roasted cauliflower, and apple.One annoyance to point out is that Hopleaf charges for soda/iced tea refills even when dining in the restaurant. At $2.50 a piece, it would be nice if the staff pointed that out. However, when we asked the waitress if there was a charge for refills after seeing the bill, she agreed the policy was ridiculous and agreed to take it off. Fair enough. Overall - I enjoyed Hopleaf, but definitely wasn't blown away liked I had hoped I would have been. Will I be back? Most likely.

They have a 4 page menu of just beers with their description, and that was just what they had on tap. They had a bunch more in bottles.My lunch consisted of the Toasted Ham and Cheese sandwich. When the waiter brought it out, the cole slaw was actually on the sandwich. I didn't realize that and told the waiter I couldn't eat cabbage so he took it back and brought me another one about five minutes later. That was probably the best ham and cheese sandwich I have ever had. I felt bad about asking them to get me another sandwich but they were extremely nice about it and made me feel that my satisfaction was most important.The Belgium style mussels were incredible. If you get them, make sure you dip the bread in the broth at the bottom of the pot. Everyone in my party was in complete agreement that this was a great taste. The frites (french fries) and aioli (a mayonnaise dip for the fries) was terrific! I'm not a big french fries guy but I ate a lot of these things.

Thats why I came, after all. One word : Yikes!My girlfriend & I came on a Friday night at 8:00pm, fully expecting to wait at the bar for awhile, seeing as Hopleaf doesn't take reservations. Luckily they had a table for 2 ready \"by the kitchen\". We said we'd check it out & decide. Those who have been here know of the small strip of four tables for 2, on the way to the bathroom, across from the expediting station. We said ok, sat & our waitress came by to say hello, but didn't take our drink order until her next visit, around 8:15. About 8:30 we got our drinks & placed our food order, which consisted of the CB&J sandwich, a broccoli & cauliflower salad & a side of mac & cheese. Our waitress then ignored our table for over an hour. She obviously was very busy on a Friday night, peak time, so we cut her some slack, but in the long run, its her job to at least check-in on her tables. Our drinks sat empty for a long time (+15 mins) as we tried to politely get her attention. Its now 9:30pm. People seated around us came & went, i.e. people seated after us were getting THEIR food, as our waitress continued to ignore us. Is this what you get when you sit at the less-desired \"table by the kitchen\"? Eh.Finally I flagged down another server & asked if we could please see our waitress. She came by & I asked for another round of drinks & when our food would be coming out as it was now 9:45pm. She scanned the tickets by the kitchen, then disappeared, not saying a word to us. I realized rather quickly that she never put the order in! She ran over to the POS system, then came back to the expediting area & the chef said \"Yeah, I know I saw it, I'll get it right out.\" (We were sitting 3 feet away & could hear everything.) Then she came to our table & said, \"It'll be right up\", as if that was explanation enough for us waiting so long. I said, \"What happened?\" Silence. \"You JUST put it in, didn't you?\" She stammered *BUSTED*... as I said to my friend, \"I just wanted to leave.\" I would rather give my money to a business who cares about pleasing their customers. But our waitress then said she would comp our meal, so we stayed of course. I'm not an idiot! :)The food came around 10:10 & it was great, way to go kitchen staff! But the bottom line was, we didn't enjoy our experience. I would have given a 1 star review, but when our bill came, she did comp our food, which was appropriate, so this is now a 2 star review. Management should consider adding more staff if their servers are too overloaded. If not, then better training is definitely in order.

My friend raved about the duck ruben which we were both severely disappointed in as each piece of duck had a thick strip of fat on it. Not marbled in fat, fat that could have been trimmed off easily. Me not being a mallard aficionado, maybe this is how you served duck, fat attached, though I highly doubt this is the case. The fries were thin and delicious at first but after a few minutes they were soggy, which I saw in a few other reviews.

I really had my hopes up for this one, savory and sweet in one sandwich? Yes, please! However, when it landed on our table it was basically fried bread (not toasted like a grilled cheese) with a swipe of fig jam and a touch of cashew butter. It was actually really gross. Frankly all you could taste was the hard, fried bread. And by fried bread, I mean almost crouton like in it's consistancy. Fried. Bread.

The bread for both sandwiches is way too thin to support \u00a0the meat and condiments. The cranberry cream cheese spread on the reuben caused the bread to become soggy and fall apart.

Still, every other dish I've tried (and I've tried a lot) has been one step too over or underdone, be it in flavor, texture, or even portion. The mustard on the brisket sandwich overpowers the tasty brisket. The dressing on the tuna tartare salad kills the tuna. The gristle on the steak frites was an example of a horrible cut of meat.

A Wednesday night at Hopleaf with a Delirium Blonde and an actual blonde (ahem, me) by your side ain't at all a bad thing. Some things you may not know: * Hopleaf has righteous bar food; specialty white wine mussels, escargot, steak frites, even sweetbreads. Mozzarella sticks need not apply and will, in fact, be laughed out the door. * They take their wine seriously. Not as seriously as the beer, natch, but the Hopleaf wine list is nothing short of impressive, albeit affordable. Not one bottle over $35. Huzzah! * I tend to get absurdly drunk here. On beer.

So what can I say that hasn't been said? How about my Hopleaf Calendar O' Beer? A little guide to my own personal preferences when I imbibe at one of the best bars in the world.JANUARY: Kwak.What better way to start the year than ordering up my first Hopleaf love? Kwak was my first libation at the bar, and when it arrived in its famous mug, I knew I'd love it, if even just for the experience. Its beautiful amber body was the perfect Belgian introduction to the Hopleaf. I also quickly learned the lesson of what starts out sounding like a joke: What happens when you cross two Kwaks together? Answer: You get kwaked. Really kwaked.FEBRUARY: Maredsous Dubbel 8.Tones of chocolate and fruit? Sounds a bit like Valentine's Day, but this is a wonderful dark ale that warms and cheers me up when I've given up on my beautiful, but bitterly cold, city. Nothing like a Belgian ale to restore some faith in the world.MARCH: La Chouffe by Brasserie d'AchouffeLa chouffe means \"the gnome,\" in case you didn't pick it up from the adorable logo. March is in like a lion and out like a lamb, but La Chouffe is just sweet the whole way down. It may be too sugary for some people, but for someone with a sweet tooth like me, this brew is fantastic.APRIL: Bell's Cherry Stout.Ah, April, the month of cherry blossoms. I celebrate by ordering my favorite Michigan brewery's cherry stout--sweet and bordering on tart, but with enough body to make me happy.MAY: Bourbon County Stout by Goose Island.At 10 bucks a pop, it's a bit pricy. But if I'm looking for bourbon-infused beer--which I am, often, and especially during Derby season--nothing satisfies like Goose Island's rare brew aged in oak bourbon barrels. I'm a fan of bourbon brown ales, which are easier to find in my Old Kentucky Home, but I'll happily settle for the stout here in the Windy City.JUNE: Atomium Premier Gran Cru by Van SteenbergeWhen I'm upstairs at the \"secret\" bar, the Atomium is my go-to beer. I adore coriander and orange flavor in beer, so it's a perfect fit. The combination of zest and kick is perfect for the sun setting on a warm early summer evening.JULY: Lindemans Peche.Most people go for the cassis when they order Lindemans lambics, but currants aren't my style. On a hot day, nothing goes down cooler and sweeter than the peach sister of the Lindeman family.AUGUST: Hoegaarden.Call me boring, but as Hopleaf says, it's the original white beer. And I love it.SEPTEMBER: Witkap.As summer turns to fall, I attempt to kick my white beer habit with something a little different. Witkap's banana essence is what does it for me. This brew also makes me crave peanut butter and banana sandwiches stuffed in paper bags as the kids head back to school.OCTOBER: Nut Brown Ale by Samuel SmithGet things dark and roasty as fall comes on full force. Nothing too fancy, but definitely classic, and I always feel good sipping this brew and knowing this is the boyfriend's father's favorite beer.NOVEMBER: St. Bernardus Abt 12.Abbey beers make me happy, particularly the Abt 12 by St. Bernardus.

The superb bartenders know their beers and if you look bewildered enough, or know nothing of beers beyond the additive-laden, American varieties of pale lager, they may let you taste one of the ones you're interested in before you commit to a full glass. If you are not interested in beer, they can accommodate you as well, with many liquors to choose from.I've never bothered hanging out in a any room but the one in front, and I've never eaten more than fries here (which are very good, but simply not what I like in fries, though I do like the garlic mayonnaise/aioli stuff), though I might some day.

Don't come here just because a lot of the beers have a high alcohol content. Further, don't order the beer with the highest alcohol content just because it has the highest alcohol content (it's not that good).

All great beers, I wish I could have tried more... next time!!!I started off with Rabbit Sausage, wood grilled, I never had beet mostarda before and it was excellent!! For dinner I tried the Venison Loin that was wood grilled with the root vegetables, fantastic, the best venison I have had in any restaurant!! Desert was a Cocoa Nib Financier which the Dragons Milk caramel sauce was to die for!!!The staff was friendly and our waitress was knowledgeable and had the right timing of serving food and drinks and I never felt rushed or ignored.I highly recommend Hopleaf!! Be careful as parking can get tricky and wait time to be seated can be 30+ minutes on a busy Friday or Saturday night, but definitely worth the wait, you can grab a drink while you wait which is nice!! The only other item to note is they do not allow any children even newborns so that can be a plus or minus depending on your situation.", "Date": "2013-05-14", "Author_Location": "Oak Park, IL"}, {"Author": "Ray P.", "ReviewID": "qByCYsDkJZmBKmg5gmGhVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I give Hopleaf 5 stars for one reason and one reason alone -- B.

The place was packed, with all the few wooden booths taken up along with the wall. However, food apparently is not served out in the bar area so we had to get in line to put our names on the waiting list for the dining area. We were told the wait was between 35-45 minutes. While we waited for one more in our party, drinks were ordered.The environment seemed pretty fun, a mix of patrons at this place, ranging from young hipsters to older, Europeans. The small wooden tables were very close together and it was quite dark. It was rather quaint, and it did feel like a bar one might find in Belgium, complete with an intricate, tin roof. The bar looked to be fully stocked with impressive amounts of unique beer. I was amused by the different shapes and sizes of the beers being consumed all around; a woman drank a beer out of what looked like one of those round-bottom chemistry flasks complete with a wooden holder, while others sipped from big beer mugs and some from miniature wine glasses. You actually had to go up to the bar to order drinks, but despite the crowd, it didn't take too long to get a drink.After almost an hour, we were summoned back to the dining area where we were seated at large, wooden table next to the fire place. The brick interior was very inviting and the metal, tiled ceiling was pretty neat too - giving this part of the bar a much more warm, modern feel. There were also sky lights up above and we could look out and see what appeared to be a nice patio dining area (which would have been nice to eat at were it not 60 degrees in the middle of summer!).We got our menus and two things caught my eye: (1) very few (and bizarre) food choices and (2) expensive given the venue. I kept re-reading the menu, as if I stared at it long enough something a little more bar-food like would appear, but to no avail. This food seemed fit for a Viking, not a boring, picky eater like me.I was happy to see something familiar, so I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer for us to share, but I was in for a surprise. These should be more accurately named onion 'strings'. The strings were very greasy and brittle; it made for some messy eating. They were served with a side of spicy mustard, but trying to dip the brittle pieces into this didn't work. Numerous times we asked ourselves if there was a \"proper\" way to eat these things.I was not feeling brave enough to order any of the mussels or the rabbit stew, so I went for what looked safest on the menu and ordered the Montreal-style Brisket sandwich on rye with the \"frites\". Our meals finally arrived after a long wait, and at this point I was starving. I took a bite of the sandwich and it immediately fell apart, so I resorted to eating the brisket with a fork. Parts of the brisket were very fatty and the flavor was pretty bland; I didn't taste any of this so called \"Montreal rub\" that was supposed to flavor this. Some parts of the meat looked undercooked in some areas too which made me not want to eat it at all. The bread was also pretty stale. Fortunately others at the table didn't mind this and ate my leftovers. The fries were very good- thin and crispy- but there was apparently no ketchup at this place! I guess this is a good thing for the 'purists' out there, but it just made my meal a little more dreadful. At least I had about 5 times the recommended serving size of fries on my plate, so I got pretty full of those. At this point though I wasn't very happy that I'd basically paid $12 for an order of fries with no ketchup.I really think food is an afterthought at this place, so I'll chalk my bad food experience up to that since I think first and foremost this place is a BAR. The ambiance was fun and seems like it would be a neat place to hang out for some drinks, but I will definitely not be heading back here to eat anytime soon.

The knowledgeable and articulate bartender kept us trying new things until we could order. Every beer he directed us to was perfect. When the kitchen did open we had the sausage plate and the steamed mussels Belgian style- again recommended by the bartender. Both were out this world.

What can I say? I'm a little backlogged. I've been here several times now and eaten twice. Great beer selection. Everyone knows that. I'm partial to pretty much any Trappist ale on the menu. Very limiting, I know. Expensive, too. But when you taste it, you know where your money went. I've never had anything to drink other than beer each time I've gone here, and doubt I ever will. With the selection they have, why bother? A waitress who served us was especially helpful to one of my dining companions. He had just recovered from a very serious dietary tract ailment that required surgery and chemotherapy and was just given the all-clear to begin resuming a somewhat normal diet that could again include meat (but nothing red) and beer (but nothing dark). Given it was his first time here and the insane selection, he needed some assistance in making a choice to keep with his doctor's orders. The waitress was stellar and knew EVERYTHING on the menu that he asked about. He wound up having like 3 or 4 different beers off the menu with her help. Thank you, kind and knowledgeable waitress, for helping my friend have a great and healthy welcome-back-to-food meal! First time I ate here, I had the venison meatloaf. Nicely seared and crusty on the outside, hot, moist and medium on the inside. Quintessential hearty cold-weather Midwestern comfort food. The last meal I had here started with mussels. They gave us a monster plate of 'em and a big damn bucket to discard the shells into. You like fresh seafood? You like shellfish? You like butter? Good, you'll like their mussels. You've never had seafood for some reason? Maybe you're turned off by the consistency? No? Well, if your dining companions order some, try one. C'mon, just one. It won't hurt. In fact, it'll help. My main course was leg of rabbit in a stew. This was the first time I had ever had rabbit. It's not bad, but I wasn't really a fan of the stew so much. It was creamy and full of vegetables, but a tad on the bland, if not gamey side. The rabbit meat was nice and lean and not bad, but I wasn't impressed enough to order it again. Still, it was nice to try something that I've not had before and will gladly give kudos to Hopleaf for carrying this. Yes, this place can get ridiculously crowded. Luckily, both times I've eaten here, it wasn't. One was a weekday afternoon, the other, a weekend early evening. It's a little more expensive than I care to spend more than every great once in awhile, but I do need to eat here more often.

One part will be on the food and one part will be on the service.First off the food there is really good. I had the pork chop special. It was cooked and seared to perfection. The meat was tender and the sides went very well with the cut of meat. This place also has a wide assortment of beers from all around the world to right in the back yard of Chicago. Great variety and a monstrous selection. I went with friends and they all enjoyed what they ordered.Secondly is service. Let me start out by stating my philosophy on tipping. Tipping is not something that is deserved. It is a direct reflection of the service received. Now granted it doesn't take much to make me happy, refill my drink, have a good attitude and just be nice. Fulfill that and I will be more than willing to tip very generously even more than say twenty percent. Well there was an air of pretentiousness to the entire situation that I felt slighted. I knew going into the situation that is was not going to be the run of the mill prices and we were OK with that. I thought maybe it was just a misunderstanding, but once the end of the meal rolled around we all shared the same feeling of our waitress being slightly pretentious and very short while also trying to push us out. Overall we unanimously said the service was very sub par for the amount of money we spent. So when we came to a consensus that we should leave a small tip it only made sense.So you may think that would be the end of the story but that wouldn't quantity 1 star would it? I always read 1 star reviews and think that doesn't constitute a review like that. One star reviews hurt the business but as you will read I really feel this is necessary.This sequence of events happens as we get up from the table. My friends are a couple of steps ahead of me at this point. Our waitress goes straight to our check book and opens it up. I haven't made it more than five steps to the door before she chases me down and decides to start a confrontation. It starts out with her saying my friend is dumb. He can't possibly realize that he is tipping on the whole thing. Of course he doesn't understand that he is tipping on the whole bill. She then proceeds to ask me why she deserved such a small tip, the entire time she was becoming visibly more and more frustrated. As I was about to take my wallet out and give her more (not because she was a good server but because I wanted to get out of this extreme awkward situation) she says \"fine just fuck off\". Now I have worked in the customer service realm and to me this was just unheard of. It doesn't matter what the customer did, I would have never have confronted them and for no reason at all would I have sworn at them. She storms off towards the back and I make my way out the front door where my friends are waiting for me. She then comes running out the door to confront everyone. She starts yelling at us and we give her some reasons why she received such a low tip.She was having none of that and our criticism went on deaf ears.Overall I'm sure that this place probably has great servers and with the food it would have been a great dining experience but after what our server did I had to come here and write a review.", "Date": "2013-08-03", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Gil J.", "ReviewID": "zgW1LbCmzt81YEsuIVz7AQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Come for the beer, stay for the food.

I also like the fact that you can mill around and get a table in the front and eat there too by ordering at the bar.A lot of people hate on Hopleaf because of the wait time, especially at night on a Wed-Sat but that's the state of this place. It's popular and tremendous so why mess with what works. Hopleaf was going to expand into the empty storefront next door but that hasn't come to fruition, probably due to the economy. \u00a0I say leave it as is.As far as negatives? A couple times the food came out pretty slow but our server was apologetic. I'd also skip the deserts because I've never had anything worth getting no matter how great it sounds. It's been a while since I've been here so perhaps the deserts are better. We shall see.It's about time for a return trip.

No \"hi\" or anything. Just looked at us. After an awkward pause, \"do you need more time?\" is apparently all she could muster.

We chose the Belgian-style broth, which proved to be an excellent decision (yay!). We were all so happy. The little pieces of celery mixed in with the mussels added something great too. And the fries that came with the mussels were really superior. I LOVED the aoili that came with the fries. It was all just perfect.I chose the CB&J as my main course. Yum, as usual. This is truly a perfect sandwich, and who doesn't love the Stilton mac and cheese on the side? One of the busboys brought out the birthday girl's main course with the mussels, but our waiter caught that and took it away.

The crowd was laid back and the music low and jazzy (at least tonight). \u00a0We didn't have to wait for a table for dinner - which is rare at Hopleaf.The food and drink are the stars here -- oh, and one certain staff member resembling Clark Gable who was SUPER entertaining and accommodating! You know who you are. It must be said that all the staff seem to know their stuff and the service was great. You have to go to the bar and order your food/drinks if you are sitting in the front but it comes out promptly. I SURE did have a few Belgians here. This is no place to order a Bud Light. Hopleaf = \u00a0BEER! The selection will dazzle you. If you're a novice there are good descriptions on the menu but the bartenders will steer you the right direction too. My favorite tonight was the Delirum Tremens. Pink Elephants on the goblet.. heh.. heh.. This beer has a high alcohol content (if you can't tell from the name). We started with 2 orders of mussels. They offer traditional Belgian style and a special of the night. We had the Belgian and the special which was a lobster and white wine broth.. I like!! I have been hesitant about ordering mussels since reading Anthony Bourdain's \"Kitchen Confidential\" so this is the only place I will still order them. They are excellent. They are served with perfect pomme frites and mayo. The broth is divine nectar and resting on top of each order is crusty bread for soaking it up.After reading all the previous reviews I had to try the C B & J, served on sourdough w/ cashew butter, fig jam and morbier cheese. It's a fancy grilled cheese basically and it's obvious it could be a great sandwich but \u00a0tonight mine was a bit too greasy and seemed like it sat too long before serving - the cheese was hard to find as if it got too hot and oozed out of the sandwich or into the bread. Why has nobody thought of this combo before? It makes so much sense. I confess I have put peanut butter on grilled cheese b4. Is that weird?? The stilton mac & cheese that comes with it... OH. My, God. YES! But wowee this is a rich, filling plate of food & they don't skimp on portions. Good thing I worked out today and didn't eat much till dinner!!One of my companions had the red cabbage salad. It was really flavorful, crunchy and surprisingly tasty - with bits of apple, goat cheese and pistachio. I liked it much more than I thought I would. I'd order it next time.

We stopped in right after they opened at 3:00 pm on a Saturday and managed to snag two seats at the bar. Quite a feat because the place got packed within 30 min after we arrived and people were standing around waiting for bar seats.A fan of lambics, I ordered an Oud Beersel framboise, a dry lambic flavored with raspberries and an awesome champagne-like acidity. Just a wonderful way to start off our visit. I followed up with a delicious d'Achouffe IPA Tripel, which wasn't a hop bomb like most American IPAs, but a more moderate, well balanced beer, with a lighter hoppy dryness and with a citrus, grassy finish. On a stop at the Hopleaf you absolutely cannot leave without having the CB&J (cashew butter, fig jam, and Morbier cheese). What really makes this dish is not just the blend of creamy butter and the rich, creamy cheese, enhance with sweet jam, but the beautifully toasted bread is what makes this dish a homerun. And did I mention it comes with an amazing cup of mac & cheese and homemade chips? This is snack food heaven for the biggest snack junkies around!Hopleaf is simply a beer lovers dream and with rich, delicious food to boot, how can you go wrong, even if it is located in Uptown?", "Date": "2012-02-26", "Author_Location": "Alexandria, VA"}, {"Author": "Kristin S.", "ReviewID": "OHD7K95_MYJ7d1L7nNAFxw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After I try the food I'll update more, but after having New Belgium's tasty new sour beer for $5?

Then my clever Chicago friend cooked up a story and scored a bench opposite a sympathetic couple who was sitting together on one side of a booth with the other bench to their booth butt-less. Eventually they left, and we all had a seat. I don't recall seeing any wait staff serving drinks to any tables.

But then we squirmed our way to the back, and saw that a couple tables were available. The hostess made certain we were aware that in order to sit back there, we'd have to order food.

I followed that up with Calabaza Blanca from Jolly Pumpkin, Michigan's premier brewer of sour, barrel-aged Belgian-style beers. I capped my beer exploits with Sah'tea from Dogfish Head, probably my favorite East Coast brewer. Oh wait, we ordered food, didn't we? Indeed - the brisket sandwich on pumpernickel was outstanding. The pink slices of smoky beef were mouthwatering, and the spicy mustard and fresh-tasting bread only served to amplify the beef's flavor profile. Portion size was ample, a common theme in all the Chicago restaurants I visited.The service was attentive and friendly.

This place is huge, and I love all the space including the upstairs balcony & back patio. I dined this time on a double date. We waited no more than 5 minutes & were seated outside. I love the different ivy growing along the bordering buildings & the tall sunflowers enveloping a patio underneath a huge green patio umbrella. A lot of green and natural ambience. The evening was a bit chilly, but I didn't mind because the food, drinks & atmosphere was great. We ordered the sausage platter to begin. Three small pieces of different sausages with onions. To drink, I had a Rosa Hibiscus draft because they were out of Huitzi from 5 Rabbit Brewery (one of my favorites, and a Chicago based brewery.) Also sampled the Meantime Scotch Ale, Mort Subite, and Zombie Killer (awesome mead, gluten free brew.) Nice selection of beer & as my first review states, I had read about Hopleaf on some published best beer bar list. For the main course, I tried my date's steak with frites, a guilty pleasure. I was a bit hooked on the frites after dipping them in lemon horseradish, aioli, & herb butter. Steak was cooked medium, and although I normally like it medium rare, it was tender & delicious. I ordered the veggie dish, which was on the scamp side, but very flavorful & interesting. Tomato gnocchi, eggplant, and I can't remember the marmalade-like substance I dipped everything in. Scrambled together, it pleased my taste buds. Although I'd say these dishes aren't very plentiful, they are packed with quality ingredients & amazing flavors. A bit on the pricey side, but you're paying for presentation & something a bit different. We shared the flourless chocolate cake at the end, and it seriously melted in my mouth. So light, but so chocolatey. I was bummed when it was placed on the table, because the piece of cake was small, but it was just enough for four of us to have a few bites & really enjoy a little treat. I actually wish more restaurants lived by the smaller portion size, healthier options philosophy. I realized how many places give you plentiful amounts of food, but are probably packed with processed, unhealthy junk. This food seemed at least somewhat healthier & like I said, more qualitative. Great experience overall. I really want to return & sit inside next time, in the evening, over a few brews.

It was a Monday night, so not super crowded, but there was a wait of 20 minutes or so. We sat out in the back beer garden, which is just a great spot. I had several delicious, strong beers (yesssss) and tried mussels for the first time ever in my life. The mussels had me hooked. The service was attentive and I was in love.Visit #2: My BFF from Michigan was in town and I wanted to impress her, so my friend and I took her to Hopleaf. I was espousing the wonders of the mussels, and she informed me she doesn't eat mussels. I had faith the rest of the food was awesome. I got the mussels, as planned, and they didn't taste AS good as before. Something was a bit off. Less seasoning or something. Still good, but hm... My BFF got a ham sandwich that she did NOT like. She said it tasted funny. I didn't try it, so I can't vouch for that. My guy friend got the trout and had no complaints.The rub with the second visit, beyond the food being \"off\" was the service. I know it was a Sunday night over Labor Day weekend and they were packed. But it was still a bit annoying when two tables, with as many or more people, were seated after us, ordered after us, but got their food before us. Mussels and all.

My friend started out with the famous Delirious Tremens (every other person seemed to be getting this), and that was a lighter beer, but that was good as well. Later on, I got the Leffe Blond- which wasn't as fruity, but definitely light and refreshing- reminded me of nature, for some reason.

The sandwich itself was perfectly crisp, and the cashew butter was insanely nutty and good. The fig jam is what made the sandwich, and I am ambivalent about the cheese. The mac&cheese was great, and the chips were okay, too. As for the beers, we all ordered a smorgasbord of beers, and I don't even remember the names of half of them. A lot of them were stouts, and I think someone might have ordered lambic. They have so many beers on tap and so many more in bottles. They have a lot of Goose Island beers, Bell's beers... even more rare beers and beers with insanely high alcohol content. If you want Miller Lite, go elsewhere. I had a half pint of Sierra Nevada's XXX 30th anniversary special and it was super hoppy and really great. The atmosphere is good, and they have outdoor seating.

They're beautiful, charming, have great taste and sincerely want you to be happy. The only downside is that they're always too busy to hang out. It's like that here: the biggest problem is going to be getting a table. My lady friend and I went to Hopleaf on a Wednesday evening and despite my earlier description, had no issue getting a table on the restaurant side when we arrived at about 5:30. By 6:00pm, every table was full. With the brick walls and wood floor, noise level is high but not unbearable. Tables are close enough to hear details of your neighbors conversations. Intimate dinners here are ill-advised.However, if meeting casually with friends it's perfect. The menu is focused on hearty Belgian and German fare and if our sampling was indicative of the quality across the board, I'd say they have it down pat. Food was 5 stars. The Alpine sausages with German potato salad was perfect. Tender fingerling potatoes, onion, a touch of bacon and a great vinaigrette mixed with 3 different sausages. Each sausage was seasoned differently and delicious in their own way. The brandade was wonderful and light; almost delicate despite the strong nature of its individual components. It's accompanying frisee salad was fresh, green, and crisp. While I did not order any other salad, I did see a couple delivered and all the greens looked just as good.For the main course we ordered mussels for two in the Belgian style. This was a lot of mussels; it could easily have been shared for 3 or 4. They were steamed in a Belgian ale with shallot, celery, thyme, and bay; and served with some excellent bread -- rare in the city, in my opinion -- and frites with aioli. The mussels themselves were of excellent quality. I did not find one closed mussel nor did I come across any grit whatsoever. All of them were plump and flavorful. The broth was well balanced and the vegetables included were still steam-crisp and tasty. The frites were plentiful and crisp, but salty -- and frites are something I like salty. Still, here, a little too much. You'll be thirsty later.While I have not mentioned the beer list, it is both broad and deep, with an emphasis on (of course) Belgian and Belgian-style beers. When in Rome, do as the Romans. I would recommend the Leffe Brune as a good all-around selection. It looks darker than it drinks and paired well with everything ordered. We didn't ask \u00a0for a dessert menu as we were too full. Portions were large, even for appetizers -- they should probably be shared. Prices were good as well. I would recommend this place to those who have the time to enjoy a leisurely meal or to those who are craft beer enthusiasts. Good food, good beer and good friendships are the theme here.

Both of our entrees were reasonably priced, large, creative and delicious. The CB&J is a fig jam and cashew butter sandwich with melted cheese and sourdough bread. Its amazing - must try!

The waitress was attentive even though she was very busy. She recommended a pumpkin beer to our friend who was pondering it and let her know she'd take it back if she wasn't a fan--also, very nice. We appreciated the friendly service. Our food was good, though nothing to write home about. We had the mussels for two in the Belgian ale. The mussels were solid, even if the broth was a bit oversalted. With the frites and garlic mayo, it was plenty of food for us both for $21. Nevertheless, it was a smallish pot of mussels, I thought, for $21. And the frites were well-flavored, but pretty soggy. I'm used to the overload of mussels and crisp frites we used to get at our favorite Belgian spots in DC, where we used to live.

We decided to sit in the front room and just order our drinks and dinner at the bar, but you can always choose to be seated in the back and be served. Ambiance - warm, inviting, and charming. I was just in Belgium last summer and this place definitely captured the atmosphere. It was wonderful! Beer - YUM! I started with Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout (13%!). Elsewhere, I've seen this on the menu for up to 12 bucks, but it was only like 6.50 at the Hopleaf. I live in Wicker Park so I definitely noticed that all the beers were priced a few dollars cheaper than what I would normally see in my neighborhood. Hooray for that! (A side note about the cost- I paid for me and my bf and the bill was only 65 dollars for an appetizer (sausage platter, 12 dollars), an entree (14), a sandwich (12), and 5 craft beers. I was expecting it to be at least 100 bucks!)Foods - TOTALLY DELICIOUS. I had the duck rueban sandwich. It was deliciously rich and the perfect thing to be eating on a cold, rainy winter night. My sandwich came with their well known frites. It is pretty hard to mess up french fries so I'm not giving them too much credit for knowing how to fry a potato--but they did hit the spot. My BF got the brisket platter which came with the mac and cheese. YUM. My friend got the CB & J sandwich. TASTY. And my other friend got the mussels. YUM. Everyone was very, very happy with the food. Transportation: The only draw back for this place for me is that it is kind of far from where I live. I hardly venture North of Addison so this was quite a jaunt. But, that being said, the Damen bus can drop you off RIGHT on the corner so it is still convenient. Anyways, I would probably never go there on a Thurs, Friday, Saturday because I can imagine this place being ridiculously crowded and I would hate it. Also, If I ever go back I wouldn't want to get there later than 6ish because it certainly filled in and you know how I hate waiting for a seat.

Go for the beer, stay for the mussels, you might learn something! Especially if you are like me and are a human magnet for German and Eastern European tourists.

If you're not sure what you would like, and the bartender is not too busy, describe what you would like to have. Yes, you are putting you selection in the hands of the bar, but I was pretty satisfied with what was given me. Part 2 of the tip- if you seem clueless, you will get ignored.

Many other bars serving Belgian beers on tap often don't have enough throughput to keep the beer fresh. There's nothing worse than paying big $ for Belgian beer only to find that the flavor is muted and stale. Bartenders never believe me on this, either, since I'm not the stereotypical beer-drinker (read: bearded, burly dude). Hopleaf's taps are *always* fresh. The combination of consistent quality plus a very interesting, ever-changing beer list makes for unrivaled educational boozing. The food is fabulous, too. Prices are a little steep in the absolute sense, but you get a really amazing meal for what you pay. Their menu has elements of Belgian, French and New American cuisine. It's interesting yet simple, wholesome, and tasty.That said, you have to be strategic when coming here due to the crowds. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, show up on the early side even if you're just drinking (6-7). You may still need ninja-esque skills to grab a table, even this early, but it's likely you'll grab one before too long. They'll serve food to the bar area, but if you want to eat in the restaurant (it's nicer) on a Thurs.-Saturday, put your name down by 6:00 or you could easily be waiting until 10:00.The Map Room is the only place that rivals Hopleaf in terms of beer selection and tap beer quality, and it's plagued by the same crazy crowds.

I feel like this place stole a piece of my soul and the terrible servers/hostesses are feeding off of it to sustain their miserable existences. NEGATIVE A BILLION STARS. The door guy: The door guy totally tricked me. Other reviews state how he's terribly rude, but he was actually nice to me. He made me believe that the rest of the staff would be like him. Wrong. Thanks door guy, you were the highlight of my dismal night. The hostess: She had a really terrible and painful looking sunburn, which is why I'm guessing she sucked and was rude. My colleague/ the birthday boy asked for a table, to which her response was \"Ugh... it's going to be a while- maybe a few hours, I don't know.\" Confused, we returned to the table, where we were having beers, and assumed she was having an off night. About 45 minutes later she came to seat us and noted that the small cake that we brought could not be eaten at the table, regardless of whether or not it was for a birthday. Hopleaf hates fun, true story. THE EVIL SERVER WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS: Oh my f'ing god Hopleaf, what do you do to these servers??? Are they paid? Are they fed? Do you lock them in the cellar at night and torture them? If not, then why WHY WHY was she the absolute worst person I think I've ever met (and believe me, I have met some truly awful people). We thought at first that she was unable to hear the pitch of her own voice, because she was barking at our table \"DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT YOU WANT? DO YOU NEED ANOTHER BEER? OH, YOU GUY ALL HAVE FULL BEER GLASSES? UGH, I DON'T HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AT THE MENU AND FIGURE IT OUT?\" Um, ok, we just asked for water, psycho. While we waited an hour for our food, we had to flag down the busboy to get our server so we could get more drinks... after 30 minutes of not knowing whether she took the rest of the night off or not, one person went to the bar and ordered herself a drink. BIG MISTAKE, THAT'S A TONGUE LASHING FROM THE SERVER. We literally got reprimanded by the server, because we were impatient. Apparently 30 minutes isn't that long to wait for your server to check on you. Weird. So, my friend leaves the table to smoke outside, and while gone, I explain to our server that I understand their food policy and ask if there was anything that could be done to acknowledge our friend's birthday (a specialty dessert or drink....). She explains to me that they are an \"ADULT\" restaurant, and at some point, adults stop celebrating their birthdays-- and that we should try that. I explain to her that it's actually very important to him for personal reasons that he's even here able to celebrate, and she continues telling me that as an ADULT ESTABLISHMENT, they don't do trivial things like acknowledge (not sing, just SAY) happy birthday and will not, under any circumstances, allow us to do so. OK, I get it-- the seven adults sitting at the table are not adult enough for Hopleaf. Hopleaf absolutely hates fun. Instead of just leaving it at that, she then tries to use an anecdote in case I was confused about the simple sentences spewing from her mouth. She explained that she doesn't come into the Gap (where she assumes I work) and try to sell Express jeans. She then goes on to say that if we want cake that bad, we can go to one of our apartments and eat it. WTF. No, no you did not just talk to me that way you f'ing psycho. I told her that she was being rude and should stop speaking to me immediately, but the batshit crazy lady continued, and repeated the SAME EXACT ANECDOTE. I told her that I was not a child and that I understood simple English without the use of anecdotes and that she was being extremely rude and should stop talking to me. We're not talking about my friend having cake anymore, you are now personally attacking me on several levels (pointing in my face, saying \"I don't know where YOU work, but if I went to the Gap...\", raising her voice, assuming my class/work/living status, etc.) and will not stop talking to me after asking her several times to stop (with patrons from other tables just staring). Oh, and if you MUST use anecdotes to get your point across, at least use them correctly. She doesn't return to our table for the rest of the night, but has one of the bartenders bring up our check. Really? Are you THAT immature and unprofessional? I guess so. After we pay (oh, and she added a very generous tip for herself) the hostess brings back our receipt. You have to be kidding me.I really don't understand how a business can employ people who yell at their customers, point in their faces, insult them, disrupt other customers at neighboring tables, and act generally unprofessional and uncourteous. I have never been treated so terribly at a restaurant in my entire life.

This way, you'll never miss a Hopleaf tasting again.Though I've been to Hopleaf close to two dozen times over the past several years, I hadn't yet experienced a tasting. Until last night. About a week ago, I saw a Facebook update announcing the Belgium-based St Martin's debut in Chicago, including an invitation to attend (with RSVP) a free tasting with the brewery's owner/brewer and their importer. It mentioned food as well, but I had Hopleaf's mussels and frites on the brain and knew I'd be saving my appetite for them (and only them) following the tasting.On a bustling Monday night (there are no slow nights at Hopleaf, FYI) I grabbed a bar seat and got cozy with my new favorite Saison, Boulevard's Tank 7. My friend soon arrived and we hightailed it the tasting upstairs (the room filled up quickly; if you want to sit down it's advisable to arrive at the start time). After an introduction, we were invited to step up and try St Martin's blond ale in addition to the first food pairing: The mussels and frites, replete with their garlic aioli counterpart... talk about hitting the foodie jackpot! These mussels are undeniably the best (tried-and-true) mussels in the city. Second up: St Martin's Tripel (move over La Fin du Monde!) and a green salad which brought out the hidden peppery notes in the beer. We finished with the brewery's pride and joy, the Brune. Like other Brunes, you can really smell the date and fig sweetness but that's where the semblance ends. The brewer, Marc-Antoine, explained that he doesn't add any sugar to this beer and that's why the finish is incredibly clean. FANTASTIC. Did I mention this entire experience was complimentary?I'm now extra-inspired to visit Belgium and all her beautiful breweries... Marc-Antoine was so affable and quick to answer our questions. His offer to personally tour the brewery with me + friends should I come visit was genuine and heartfelt.

However, when I went there yesterday with a group of girlfriends, I was extremely disappointed -- bad service, bad food, high tab. I've not had such a bad dining experience since... well, ever. I am a lover of all food; seriously, I will eat anything. It is not often that I leave food on my plate, and it is even less often that I will write something like \"terrible service, bad food, won't be back\" on my check. But I did, and here's why:I got to Hopleaf before my lady friends. The bar was quite crowded so I meandered to the back of the restaurant, where I was met by a hostess. I said, \"Hello. I'm meeting some friends, I'm not sure if they're here yet.\" The hostess cut me off and said, \"Well, I don't know if they're here yet either. Go look for them outside.\" Her response seemed a bit rude, but I decided to overlook it. I went to the patio, where one of my friends appeared moments later. The patio is nice, but it is extremely dark, and all the tables near the very dim lights had been taken. We sat in a black corner, where we had to use our cell phones to read the menu. When the rest of our friends arrived, the waitress came by and gave us some drink suggestions, which was about all she did for the entire two hours we sat there. Drinks came to the table in an extremely slow fashion. Water had to be asked for more than once. We ended up ordering two appetizers (mussels for two and the cheese plate), which came 45 minutes after we ordered them. The mussels tasted fine, but they were by no means outstanding. There was barely any broth in the dish. The best part of the appetizer was the fries and aioli dipping sauce, but honestly, I didn't come to Hopleaf for the fries. I can get good fries elsewhere without paying $46 for dinner. We asked the waitress for more bread to dip in the broth (we had five people at the table), but like the water, it never showed. A very nice busboy ended up bringing us bread and water. His service was really the only redeeming part of the evening. Additionally, the cheese plate left something to be desired. Maybe it was a poor choice on our part given that we had so many mouths to feed, but this plate was dainty, to say the least. Dinner came a bit quicker than our appetizers, but on the whole, it was pretty terrible. Two of my friends ordered the brisket sandwich, and one of those friends didn't even eat it. She literally gave her whole plate back to the waitress, who just took the plate without even asking why my friend was returning it. My other friend ate some of hers, but she didn't like it either. She said the meat was too fatty. I, myself, had a similar problem with the pork belly and prawns entree. I always jump at the chance to order pork belly because I think it is delicious. I realize that pork belly is a fattier cut of meat, but what I received was so disgustingly fatty that I barely ate it. The prawns were fine, but the corn pudding that came with it was sub par, and the fruit salsa that was supposed to come with it was almost nonexistent. I had one of the most expensive meals on the menu so I expected a lot more from it. Please... don't make me pay $23 for something almost inedible. My next friend ordered the duck reuben, which was better than the other meals, but that's really not saying a lot. It was pretty unimpressive, even though the description sounded inspired. The last friend ordered the soup of the day, which, if I remember correctly, was a ginger carrot soup. She said it tasted good, but for the flowers on top, which, considering the rest of the meals, was hardly anything to complain about. For the main part of our meal, we only had five people at our table. One other girlfriend showed up at the very end for one drink, and then we were charged gratuity for six. I understand that this is restaurant policy, but our waitress DID NOT deserve a $40 tip. Now, you might be wondering why we didn't complain. Well, we would have if our waitress ever came back... someone else brought our check. Usually, I think a restaurant deserves two chances before I make up my mind about it, but one chance was more than enough in this case.

The waitress then goes to get my wife and asked if she had bought a beer at the bar yet. My wife replied no, and the waitress said that our table was ready outside so she could just order one there. So my wife comes back to the patio and then we wait for the waitress to come back out to show us to our table. Then the waitress comes out and says she's so sorry, but she thought my wife was someone else and our table is in fact not ready. The waitress said, \"Well, I asked if your name was Amanda.\" My wife said, \"No, you asked if I had ordered a beer yet.\" Obviously, my wife's name is not Amanda and would have never said yes to that question. The rest of the evening was OKAY. \u00a0The funny thing is, the food was actually pretty good. \u00a0The beer list is great, but the other thing we had to put up with is the passive aggressive correcting on the names of the (by design) obscure Belgian beer list. \u00a0That's just annoying.On the way home I said to my wife that it must be a culture that they cultivate there. \u00a0That's the only explanation for the hostile behavior of the staff. \u00a0It's weird. \u00a0I just won't spend my money at a place like that again. \u00a0There are just WAY too many great places to eat in the city of Chicago.", "Date": "2010-06-27", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Sean B.", "ReviewID": "6RrzNVONpoOUlqET7rrfzA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is simply inexcusable in 2012, regardless of how good your food is, how good the beer list is, how nice the new renovated space is, when you sit down for a $70 meal to be charged $2.50 for a (very slow) fountain refill of diet coke and to only discover it when the bill arrives at the end.

The last time I frequented this establishment was in December of 2011 on a Friday night, where it was packed and bustling with a long wait. We were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the majority of the restaurant, which was nice.I will break down my experience as follows: The Beer Menu: Hands down, five stars. There is always an incredible draft selection that is broken down into Belgian Draft Beers and other Craft Brews from around the globe. No matter how picky the beer drinker is (ahem, my father who joined me and was looking for a Blue Moon...) there is something to be enjoyed. Our table ranged in choices from an English Apple Cider to an Allagash White, and everyone seemed content. I'm also amazed at the extensive bottle list that Hopleaf has, and the choices can be quite overwhelming! All in all, if this establishment went downhill as a whole, but kept their beer selection intact, I would still frequent it on a regular basis.The Service: Three stars. It appears to have gone downhill since the last time we were at Hopleaf, which as I mentioned was on a busy Friday night and we had a VERY attentive waitress. For it being a Monday night, and slow by comparison, our waiter was slow at getting us beers. Luckily, the first round came rather quickly (after he almost dumped half of it on the floor) so we didn't really notice how slow he was to check on us/replenish our drinks. As for the food, we put in our order within 15 minutes of arriving, and it took about 45 minutes for the food to come out. We didn't get anything too crazy--just the brisket sandwich, the brisket platter, the rabbit, and the Flemish stew, but it all came out piece-meal and slow. This is a problem for me, as I feel that the food should have come out together, or within minutes... not 10-15 minutes of one another. The Food: This ranges somewhere between three and four stars. We started out with an order of frites for the table, which were just okay. Some of the frites were soggy and others were overdone. Although, the side of mayo/aioli was to die for, so this made up for some of the lackluster frites. For the main entree I chose the brisket platter which was pretty good. Sure, it's no Smoque or Smoke Daddy, but their take on it was very interesting. The brisket was somewhere between a jerkey-like consistency and a thin cut brisket. It was served with a small side of mac and cheese which was gooey and saucy and sprinkled with breadcrumbs--everything a good bowl of mac and cheese should consist of. Also, the side of mustard was absolutely delicious, as a little bit went a long way and really enhanced the flavor of the meat. I'd recommend this dish as it seems to consistently be on the menu. My boyfriend got the rabbit dish, which I nabbed a few bites of. The rabbit was perfectly cooked and flavorful, and the dish was a lot larger than I imagined.

We were put in the corner of the dining room, which by its self would be ok, no big deal, but with a bunch of other seats open and other two person groups (read, hipsters) getting great seats it was a little annoying to be put in the corner and out of the way. There was a group of four gentlemen that came in about five minutes after my girlfriend and I and they actually got their food before we ever received our drinks. Once we were finally able to order (after more than 30 minutes of waiting without even ordering our drinks) we never saw the waitress again, she didn't even bring our food out or ask us if we were ok, until the very end to tell us the kitchen was now closed. When the food finally came out, it was very greasy and mostly burnt. The fries looked nothing like the ones in the picture provided on Yelp, they were all burnt and I was only able to find about 8 of them that would even pass for edible. My sandwich, the Brisket Sandwich, was actually pretty good, in any other circumstance I would've been happy on it, but with the poor service, and the fact that everything else was either burnt to a crisp or grease soaked, the entire evening was ruined. They waitress couldn't even get the check right, my girlfriend had to go give it to her so we could finally pay and leave, because after dropping it off she had to go flirt with the kitchen staff so was way to busy to let us pay and leave.I was very excited about going to The Hopleaf so my hopes may have been too high, but my girlfriend had never heard of it and she was just as disgusted as I was.Not only will I never go back, I will strongly suggest for anyone I know to stay away as well.", "Date": "2009-11-02", "Author_Location": "Charleston, SC"}, {"Author": "Michelle C.", "ReviewID": "C8-qAx1ZoywoiJFIktmKbQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "CB&J sandwich amazing!!!!

That being said, I happily report I hate beer. Confused? Don't be, read on!To celebrate the birthday of my best friend's wife (who is also my good friend) we celebrated at the Hopleaf. Given that my best friend and his wife are beer connoisseurs to the max. Walking down the microbrew aisle with these too is akin to \"done it. done it. meh. had it. yum. done it. etc.\" ... So, suffice to say they were jazzed to go to the Hopleaf given it's amazingly deep beer menu. I myself am not a lover of beer at all. Luckily the Hopleaf did have other fine drinks to peruse. Since I like lambic (wild fermented fruity beer) and hard ciders, I was happy to see \"Original Sin\", a granny smith hard cider from across the pond. And for 5 bucks I felt like i was getting a deal. Some of the beers on the menu tip the wallet over 10 dollars a glass. For the hops aficionado... I take it that this may be a pittance to pay for the experience. But enough with the drinks. Suffice to say: there's plenty of choice, and the staff is both knowledgeable and helpful (so I was told, more on that later.).The menu itself isn't large, but everything on it says \"upscale\". The prices however are truly a deal all things considered. The table started with the sausage plate for an appetizer. While it was only large enough to grant each person at the table 1 large finger sized sausage, and a pair of potatoes (\"german\" hot potato salad made with fingerlings)... The flavor was excellent. My sausage was well cooked, had a nice bite and snap to it, and provided homemade whole grain mustard was hot, but well made. The potatoes were simply amazing. I'd go back for JUST that salad, honestly. Tossed in apple cider vinegar, garlic, and bacon. At 12 bucks, it was a tad overpriced, albeit amazing to eat.Entrees, entrees, entrees. My best friend had a brisket sandwich. His wife and my wife both settled on the Duck Reuben. The brisket was tender, and well seasoned. The duck reuben was well received, albeit my wife wasn't the biggest fan of the house made sauerkraut, nor the marbled rye it came on. All the sandwiches came with a mound of hot pomme frites served with house made aioili. I myself opted for the \"House Specialty\" Mussels. For 12 dollars I received a heaping bowl full of truly tender, perfectly cooked bivalves in a Belgium style broth. Steamed in an Wittekerke white ale w/ sliced shallots, celery, thyme & bayleaf... the broth while a tad salty, could almost be eaten by itself. Combine that with a cone of hot frites, and a pair of crusty house made rolls... and you have a truly wonderful meal. While I was warned by my best friend \"Mussels are no entree\" ... he was wrong in this case. Suffice to say, between lapping up the broth, polishing off the pile of mussels, and soaking the rolls up... I was very satisfied. And for the money? Can't be beat.A few more beers later, and the table was ready for dessert. Each of us tried something different (for obvious sharing later)... apple fritters, a stout laden chocolate mousse, a petite lemon tart, and honey profiteroles with wine soaked berries were ordered. At 8 dollars a pop, once MIGHT say they were a bit over priced, but at that point, full of beer, frittes, and good food, we could have cared less. The fritters were ample, hot, and delicious. The mousse had a beautiful dark and bitter undertone from the stout. The lemon curd in the tart was perfect while the pastry shell lacked finesse... and the goat-cheese stuffed cream puffs were just a tad too much on the tart side. Our server wasn't necessarily attentive. It was almost as if he were trying harder to be a patron than a waiter. Several times whilst we tried to flag him down, I'd noted he probably needed to save his strength for his band's debut at the double door. The laughter at the table made it easier to forget that our server was more enthused to look like everyone else (\"That perfect mix of yuppy, preppy, and hipster\") than wow us with service. All that being said, let me make it clear: The food is amazing, and fresh. It's well paired and cooked with the abundance of booze within their storerooms. The drink selection is staggering. The prices for the food may offset your expensive beer tastings... and ultimately, we'll be back to sample more offerings in due time.

The encyclopedic beer list is hands-down the best in Chicago, no arguments - it always contains some local stalwarts such as Alpha King, Daisy Cutter and Green Line, as well as more interesting brews from the Chicago area's finest microbreweries. It also manages to bring in limited-edition selections from important microbreweries from around the nation (Dogfish Head, North Coast, Sierra Nevada, and New Belgium are frequent fliers), as well as a long list of Belgians that are difficult to find elsewhere in Chicago. And that's just the drafts - the bottle menu is Delirium-esque in scope. They have everything from Italian brews that taste most like Champagne to all the Belgian Trappists (apart from the impossible to find Westvleteren). If you want Bud, or even Sam's, go to the Jewel, because you won't find standard offerings on this beer list. Go to town on some stuff you've never heard of, and perhaps will never encounter again!The food is also uniformly divine. I have quite simply never had a bad bite here myself*, and I've probably eaten here 2 dozen times. The moules frites are the best I've tasted anywhere, including Europe - the mussels are perfectly tender in either preparation (one of which is always Wittekerke Belgian white with onions, and the other of which varies seasonally), and the frites are delectably thin and crisp, and are served with a garlic aioli that is delicious enough to be bathed in. Seriously, I detested mayonnaise in all forms before eating this stuff, and still do detest mayonnaise unless it is this stuff. It's that good. The CB&J is worth all of the googol of calories it contains; the bread is deliciously buttery, and the fillings (cashew butter, fig jam, and smoked gouda) compliment one another like a tripartite version of the yin/yang. As if it wanted for decadence, the sandwich is served with Stilton Mac and Cheese. The Montreal style brisket melts in your mouth while still retaining its meatiness and is well-seasoned (and is probably best ordered in platter form, as the bread simply cannot stand up to its juicy excellence). All specials I have ordered (fried smelts and rabbit stew are two that leap to mind) have been spectacular. As you can probably tell, this fare is not for the faint-of-heart, or faint-of-calories-in-diet, but if you're willing to splurge, it is well worth it.All in all, I have never had anything less than an excellent time at the Leaf, whether eating, drinking or both. This is a great place to come with groups of friends, or even on dates (provided you go during the week or early enough that it isn't packed yet). It deserves its reputation as the premier gastropub in Chicago.*I will say that other friends of mine have had bad bites here. I have heard that the Duck Reuben is unimpressive, although I can't stand cream cheese and thus have never ordered it.

Hopleaf has the vibe of being in a pub in Europe; it is a bit noisy but not uncomfortably loud. There is a large bar area, a back dining room and a small loft (as well as a beer garden for the warmer months). This was my first trip to Hopleaf in a while and the evening started off a little awkward when I was carded by the bouncer; as I am closer to qualifying for a senior discount than I am to being underage this was kind of a tacky manner to be greeted in a place that has the reputation for being upscale and sophisticated. During prior visits to Hopleaf I have had to wait for a table (it is a very popular venue), but fortunately tonight the dining room was not yet at capacity and we were immediately seated once our entire party arrived (it was a Wednesday evening around 6:30pm).My wife and I started off the evening with a round of their beers at the bar while waiting on our friends. Hopleaf has a vast beer menu and there is a nice description of each of the approximately three dozen beers on tap (with one side being U.S. beers and the other imports - mostly Belgian). Most are priced in the $6 to $7.50 range and all come with the appropriate style glassware. This is a place for beer aficionados; asking for Bud or Miller here would be akin to ordering water at Coyote Ugly. The bartenders are knowledgeable if you are not familiar with the beers, just let them know what kinds of beer you like and they will hook you up with something similar. They also are flexible with permitting you to sample a couple of beers before making your selection. I started with a Golden State Ale (brewed with poppy seeds) by Uncommon Brewers that was very good. I had the Half Acre Daisy Cutter Pale Ale with my meal which was extremely hoppy and delicious. Once our friends arrived we were seated in the dining room. For food our table wound up sharing several appetizers and the CB&J sandwich (Cashew Butter, Fig Jam and Raclette cheese pan fried on sourdough served with chips and stilton mac n' cheese). Appetizer wise we went with their famous mussels (which were steeped in a white ale sauce with shallots and came with a very large cone of fries), the Chef Martin sausage plate (served with bourbon pancetta beans), the sauteed veal sweetbreads (served with pickled beets and broccoli) and an extra order of the stilton mac n' cheese. With the exception of the sausages the portions were extremely generous and everything tasted great. The entire meal (including tax, tip, and a beer a piece) came to just $22 per/person, so really a great bargain for food and drinks of this quality. Despite mainly ordering just appetizers, the portions were so large and the food so hearty that we were pleasantly stuffed. Our service was pretty much run of the mill. No complaints as she was sufficiently attentive, the food and beverages came out at a decent pace and no mistakes were made with our order or tab, but neither the servers nor the bartenders displayed much charm or personality. They just were pretty much about business. Hopleaf is definitely among the better venues in Chicago for sampling a variety of craft beers and for upscale pub food. Due to their tendency to become crowded (and their no reservation policy) I recommend coming on a weeknight if possible or arriving early.

Being as adventurous as I am with bars, I said why not, packed my girl in the car and went to Hopleaf. I knew nothing about the place until I got there and saw it was a Belgian bar. As soon as I realized this, my face was like when a cartoon character sees something beautiful. My eyes bulged and \"oooooooooohhhhh\" was the only thing that came from my mouth. Before we ordered, we walked to the back to get our name on the waiting list for a table. This is my only point of contention. You don't take reservations? That is kinda weird. They said it would be 45 minutes to an hour and we went to the bar to wait. We ordered some delicious beer (I ordered the Urthal which had a nice smooth taste) and got lucky enough that a table opened up as soon as we had the drinks. About 20 minutes passed and they called our name. We were seated in this awesome upstairs section looking over everyone. The dining area is decorated very nicely and you would never know it if you just hung out in the bar. Now my companions were boring and ordered the steak frites which they enjoyed. I on the other hand wanted to be adventurous, so I ordered the rabbit soup. It was perfect. The rabbit had been cooked perfectly, and even sitting in the broth, it stayed tender. It was a really great experience and I owe my friend for recommending Hopleaf.Note: If you are driving, get there early because you will be driving around forever for a place to park.", "Date": "2008-09-15", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Danny W.", "ReviewID": "Awa9J84rE7c6z-Id5cYizw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is clearly the best bar in Chicago, from an objective \"I don't know the bar tenders and I'm not a local\" point of view.

Sure, other bars may have more taps, but what's the point if half of them are devoted to the big 3 breweries and/or the most popular imports? There's more love for beer here than just about anywhere. A hand-picked, frequently-changing selection of about 25 Belgian beers and 25 non-Belgians on tap, along with a bottle menu bigger than the food menus of most Chinese restaurants, ensures you'll be overwhelmed. The back dining room is incredibly attractive, and features a real wood fireplace in the winter and a beautiful garden space in the summer. The front bar is refreshingly free of televisions and thump-thump-thump music. The food is impressive, especially the mussels, fries, and aioli. When I can be convinced to stray from the mussels (which is not often), the Hopleaf's chef does great things with duck and makes a pretty faithful rendition of a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. Suffice it to say that whenever I come here I have a blast and feel thoroughly satisfied.Why the missing star, though? The crowds. Holy Flying Spaghetti Monster, the crowds. I'm at the Hopleaf fairly often, but it's been about a year since I've come in and found a seat in the front room (unless I show up after 11 on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday). The back room is not much better. Friday and Saturday you'll invariably be quoted a 1.5+ hour wait for dinner, and even on weekdays a half-hour to 45 minutes is common. Just about the only time you can get seated immediately is during Bears or Cubs games, provided it's early in the season and the teams haven't embarrassed themselves out of the playoffs yet.

Went on a Thursday night and was very impressed by how packed, yet calm and inviting the atmosphere was. Walked to the back of the restaurant to get a table and the hostess said that it would be a little bit of a wait, but we were free to go upstairs and grab a beer and hang out. The bartender upstairs was extremely personable and made us feel right at home. A few minutes after we grabbed our beers, the hostess came upstairs and found us to let us know our table was ready and walked us back down to the dining room. Being in the industry, I am constantly looking for/noticing the little details of service that most people wouldn't (and am usually easy to disappoint). However, this was not the case at all. Our server was very knowledgable and sweet - always close by if we needed anything but not in-your-face or pushy which is always awesome to see - especially on a busy night. All in all - I will definitely be back soon.Service - 10/10Beer Selection - 10/10 (Any bar with Daisy Cutter on tap is doing something right, not to mention the slew of amazing micro brews, etc.)Food - 7/10Mussels are a must - you won't get a better deal anywhere - ESPECIALLY for the price and the HUGE side of pomme frites and baguette that comes with each order.Both brussel sprout dishes are amazing - personally I would go back for the ones with truffle oil... The other prep. (with bacon lardons) was also delicious, but a little in your face with the overwhelming pork flavor.Steak and Frites - PASS. I was sure that their 10-12 oz grass fed ribeye would be amazing after tasting everything up to the point, but.. nawww.For one, it kindof pissed me off that you cant substitute sides because I really wanted to try the mac and cheese... but you can ONLY get the frites or a salad - Opted for the salad which was just that... a salad.. because I was already stuffed with the huge order of frites that came with the mussels.Second, you have a choice of which butter you want over the steak - we got the lemon horseradish butter, which was just a HUGE dollop of from what I could taste.. lemon juice and butter - didn't add anything to the steak and waayyyy too much that it overpowered everything because it was already half melted when it got to the table.Last, the steak itself, was nothing more than you what you would expect at Fridays or Applebee's, etc.. to be honest, maybe not even that mediocre.. It was a nice size, but oddly thin.. you could tell it had been marked on the grill, but aside from some faint lines, there was basically NO sear on the steak, which just left it limp.. fatty.. and sitting in a pool of melted butter. I couldn't help but keep thinking about the nasty looking steaks that they would eat in the movie Napoleon Dynamite. Usually people judge a restaurant based on the last thing they eat, as it's what sticks in their mind the most... for me and the steak - I would usually say that I'd never go back..

I am not necessarily a light weight (I will admit that I have become a cheaper date the older I get) but every time I go here we usually have to wait an hour and a half to get a table. I am easy going and enjoy sitting at the bar, and I anticipate it so it is not a problem. The thing is that I get pretty tipsy (OK a little drunk maybe) by the time that I sit down for dinner. Poor planning on my part considering that I choose beers that are 10% and probably hadn't eaten since noon. Something to keep in mind though. Just to give a little more info about the food - the mussels are awesome! loved the sauce they come in. I once ordered the lobster sauce mussels that were a special and regretted it, not as good. Appetizers - the sausage plate was good but I don't remember thinking it was amazing, it was sausage, what can I say? I did love the quail, fabulous. Entrees - I love the steak frites, one time I ordered the brisket and that was good too, but the steak frites is really nice. The steak is so big that I am able to take half of it home and use it on a salad the next day which is a bonus. Side story - last December when I was here my date and I were seated in the balcony section, I was sitting with my back to the bars that overlook the rest of the diners below. I want to say ahead that I wasn't super drunk, but as I mentioned earlier I had had a few drinks without eating and it was pretty late at night. Well, the server brings me my steak, I pick up the knife and it slips out of my hand - hits the floor - and bounces OFF the balcony.

So when I told her I didn't know my answer to some of her queries (kind of like when you go to the eye doctor and they are testing you for glasses and they ask which is better and they look essentially the same so you don't know what to say), she seemed a bit annoyed by my lack of beer knowledge. \u00a0She was like some kind of beer sommelier and my crude palate might have offended her. \u00a0Anyway, in the end she recommended something for me and when it came it was REALLY good. \u00a0So she was really good at her job! \u00a0Oh, and when my beer came it was this strange glass that was held in a wooden contraption. \u00a0Kind of like a test tube in a test tube holder because the glass was tall and skinny and wouldn't have stood up by itself. \u00a0I thought I was supposed to take the glass out and drink from it and then put it back in the holder to keep it from spilling but she informed me that I was to just grab the wooden handle of the contraption and lift the glass that way. \u00a0It felt a bit strange, but it did work. \u00a0I'll see if I can post a picture of the thing...When it comes to the food I was excited about the menu. \u00a0There were lots of things that sounded good that I wanted to try. We got an onion ring appetizer that was good but nothing extremely special. \u00a0We also got the mac and cheese which was excellent.

It does hold a special place in my heart; I developed a taste for 'fruity Belgian ale' while living in The Netherlands, as well as Leffe, and was thrilled to find it in Chicago back in the day. Hop Leaf is a steady winner in so many areas: great European beers and ales, $5 pints of Dogfishhead 90 minute IPA on tap, moules et frites, and the dreamy CB&J served with a side of stilton mac n' cheese. I have tried on several occasions to recreate the CB&J at home--I even stewed my figs!--but nothing has come close to Hopleaf's. The only downfall with the sweet and savory sandwich is that it discourages the drinking of the Leaf's amazing Mustard Ale. Speaking of mustard, the sausage plate rivals anything you would find at Hot Doug's. Back to my favorite beer, it compliment and heighten your experience with the Nueske ham sandwich and the brisket sandwich, so never fear. Mmm...the Nueske; there's a reason TOC voted it the best thing they ate in 2006! \u00a0Perhaps Hopleaf is trying to compete with Lula for the longest wait and snottiest hostesses.

There are the usual whiskeys and scotchs' as well, but this place is mostly a beer place. Apart from Kwak (which is a must-have), I would also recommend Ommengang.Food:The menu is pretty limited but thats understandable that the place is more about the beer than the food. However, whatever's on the menu is fairly well-made. I would recommend the Mussels and the duck.The place:The only thing that leaves a lot to desire is the space available. Typical wait-periods for a dinner table on weekends can be from 45 mins to 2.5 hrs! The place is easily crowded due to its small size.

I briefly considered giving them only 3 stars for this review because the hostess' bad attitude really bothered me and almost spoiled my dinner experience there (see bottom of review, downgraded to 3 stars now). Although we asked her in a very respectful manner, she made no secret of the fact that she was extremely annoyed by our request to move to the table right next to us where some people were about to leave (we asked right after sitting down, because our table was right by the hallway and there was a cold draft that was very uncomfortable). She then actually made us get up and wait in the front area. In the meantime, the first table we were sitting at remained empty the whole time we were standing up waiting and there were no people waiting to be seated so there really didn't \u00a0even seem to be a point to making us get up in the first place. When we came in, there was no warm welcome, when we left she looked our way as we walked right past but there was not even a simple \"Thank you\" or \"Have a good night\" from her. Unlike her, the bouncer by the front entrance actually had the class and business smarts to thank us for coming. \u00a0But in all fairness, the cozy dining room, friendly waitress, great food and impressive selection of beers still need to be rewarded with a decent rating. I don't recall the name of the Belgian style beer I had but it was very good. We tried the Latkes appetizer - very good. \u00a0As an entree I had the rabbit stewed in beer with small dumplings, onions, carrots etc, which I liked quite a bit. I also got to try somebody's CB&J sandwich (on sourdough with cashew butter and fig jam), which I thought was good but wouldn't necessarily order myself. Somebody else at our table had the Braised Venison Ribs - didn't try them myself but the person who ordered them said they were very good.In conclusion, I would return to this place for dinner or to try some more of their excellent beers but if I encountered another similar unwelcoming experience upon arrival as with the hostess that night, I would prefer to spend my $$ elsewhere.A follow-up (1/29/11): After writing this Yelp review, I went to the restaurant's website and emailed it to them along with a very polite message that I simply wanted to make them aware of the issue with the hostess that night. I received an automated \"Thank you for your comment. We will get back to you as soon as possible in regards to your message\" email. But it's now 6 weeks later and I never actually received a reply from anyone. That, along with remembering the fact that I hate it when employees of an establishment where I go to spend my money have any kind of an attitude with me, the paying customer, just cost them a star.

I think they're expanding into the adjoining place, so maybe things will go a bit more smoothly once that goes down, and they'll be able to run they place properly.

No reservations, and they won't seat you if your whole party isn't there, and other nasty triage-type restrictions which I understand, due to how ridiculously busy they are, but that's unwelcoming and not cool in my book. Maybe just go when they first open up for the day. Of course, the dining area isn't even open at that point. Well, whatever.
