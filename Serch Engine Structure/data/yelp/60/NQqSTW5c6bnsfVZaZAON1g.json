The Tenaya Creek IPA was excellent along with the grilled calamari. My lady got the surf and turf while I got the dry aged T-Bone for our entree. Everything was cooked to perfection, that T-Bone steak with the filet and the skirt steak melts. baby spinach and roasted asparagus to compliment all that beautiful red meat.Their beer and wine selection was fantastic, I believe they have over a 1000 different bottles to choice from. I also enjoyed the Dogfish 60Minute IPA on tap. To top off the night the table shared their infamous Cinnamon monkey bread and the strawberry shortcake.

This place exceeded my expectations, by far! We began our meal with drinks. There were beers, cocktails, and wine. Tons of options at various prices. I ended up getting the prosecco, which was wonderfully crisp. We settled on the grilled calamari as an appetizer. It was OK, but nothing to rave about. I ended up ordering the surf and turf, which was FANTASTIC. This can easily be shared. The lobster sauce was buttery awesome perfection. However, I think the largest highlight was the monkey bread.

I had the lobster bisque and found it overwhelmingly over seasoned with cinnamon. It tasted more like cake batter than bisque. Next, I had the arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette. They actually refused to add tomatoes to it! For the first time in my life I had to send food back to the kitchen. The taste of lemon was so intense, I felt like I was biting directly into one with each bite. I couldn't muster the courage to finish the dish. The risotto that we had as a side had a taste that reminded me Betty Crocker Instant scalloped potatoes. It was sticky and undercooked. I must say, the service was wonderful; very attentive and friendly. Other dishes that we got (scallops, Wagyu tartare, and hangar steak) were delicious. Overall, a disappointment.

We all looked at each other after and agreed that it was a bit of a letdown. Oh well, live and learn. Hopefully you learn from this and go to a better steakhouse if you're in Vegas.

Short rib was melt-off-the-bone great but there were some parts of it that were way too fatty. Eggplant was good, and a very large portion perfect for sharing.

Follow the signs to Wet Republic and the floor will change from carpet to smooth concrete. It's on your right, next to Shibuya. # The \"Hawaiian\" bread they serve is whatever so don't eat too much of it.# They can do half portions of the salads and side dishes# I recommend the Wagyu Skirt Steak (14 oz). It's tasty and has a nice crust. Not too hungry? Split it with 2 ppl. It's pricey at $79, but it's Wagyu.# Average steak price is around $60. Cheaper & pricier options available.--------------------------------------------------MY EXPERIENCE: --------------------------------------------------The walk to Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak is the same walk you'd take to get to Wet Republic, MGM Grand's dayclub. It was close to dinner time when I strolled to the restaurant and as I did, I went past the opposing traffic of Wet Republicans. It was a testament that the pool scene was coming to a close. For them, it was the opposing traffic of a man who lost $120 at the poker tables and ready to blow $140 more on fine dining. Of course, that wasn't obvious to them. I wasn't wearing a scarlet letter \"L\" for loser or anything. [THE ATMOSPHERE]As a single diner, I just sat in the lounge area of Craftsteak, right by the bar. The area was fine. It overlooked the bar's illuminated collection of whiskeys, gins, vodkas, and other magical tonics. Craftsteak's ambience is familiar and comfortable -- it is clean, sleek, and modern. It's not pitch black like old school steakhouses or brightly lit. The soft yellow lighting, modern furniture, and calm noise level murmurs classy. Surprisingly, I was anti-classy, but felt comfortable in a t-shirt and shorts oddly enough. \u00a0The yelpers say \"dressy\", but I say being dressed in clothes is good enough for this occasion. I don't think they enforce a dress code, but if you have a date do wear a shirt and slacks. Look who I dined with in my plain clothes -- NOBODY. [THE FOOD]You will be served \"Hawaiian Bread\" sprinkled with sea salt on the top, in a small Staub cast iron cakepan \u00a0It's nicely browned on the top. It looks appetizing, smells, appetizing, but why why is the taste underwhelming? The other Yelpers are right. It's too delicate in texture and taste for it to go with steak. I mean the taste is just flat and blander than actual Hawaiian bread. They need a heartier bread. I wanted to eat some vegetables instead of eating just steak. However, the side dishes and salads seemed like too much food and a waste of money. At $13-15 for a salad or side dish uhhh probably not. \u00a0But, the server allowed me to get half orders of the Persian Cucumber salad and the Snap Peas for my side dish. Now that's more reasonable! \u00a0Now, I can get some dose of fiber and vitamins for EDC Day 2 recovery. The Persian Cucumber salad had a nice clean taste, but it was on the plain side. I just tasted fresh leafy greens and light oil with a tiny bit of zest from the ginger. I wanted more OOMMPH from the salad. \u00a0If you want a simple salad, this is your dish. Avoid this one if you expect more from your leafy greens. My medium-rare Wagyu Skirt Steak (14 oz.) was very tasty for a lack of a better word. It had a decent caramelized crust on both sides and the dish itself was surrounded by a small pool of sauce. I love when I bite into a steak that has a full crust over it -- you get that sweet taste of caramel, marbling fat, and protein in every bite...but my Skirt Steak only had a decent crust so I didn't feel all of the magic. But I will say that the skirt steak was still an excellent choice and highly recommended under the Yelp tips section. I have no idea what kind of reduction was in the steak's pan, but it paired very well with the meat. You couldn't really taste the sauce unless you dipped your fork in and only tasted that. My belief on pairings (whether it's wine/meat, sake/fish, sauces/food) is if your taste buds can't really notice the contrast between the 2 flavors, it means they complement each other very well. In my example, the sauce and steak almost blend into each other unnoticed. Hence, a great pairing. The glass of Pinot Noir I got wasn't a perfect pairing with the steak, but it was easy to drink with its fruit and warm spice notes \u00a0-- c'mon it's a Pinot. It can do no wrong. I got a serving of fruit out of it. Fruits, vegetables, carbs, and meat...the U.S. government should be proud of me for having a balanced, elitist meal. I skipped dessert because it was a no no on the U.S. Food Plate diagram. Just kidding. I was just too full. [THE SERVICE] The server was polite and attentive. Everybody from the water guy to the steak delivery man checked up on you to see if you needed anything or if you were satisfied. I liked the service.

Nothing was memorable minus the rib-eye, which was good because it was fatty. The meat quality wasn't particularly reflective of the price and the flavor was almost a bit bland, even for me, who avoids salt at all costs. Nonetheless, the spinach and potato pur\u00e9e sides saved the meal and were a great complement to the meat.This place was nice, but it definitely isn't the best steakhouse in Vegas, I'm sure of it.

I love steak and I am somewhat of a steak snob. This was the best steak I have ever had hands down. I ordered the Black Angus Filet Mignon and it was amazing. I like my steak on the rare side and when I go to a place that specializes in steak I go medium rare cause they actually know how to do that right. It was perfectly cooked. It was tender and juicy and every bite melted in my mouth. It was a pretty thick steak too but it was still so tender and soft. The knife just went right through it with ease. For my side I ordered the lobster bisque soup and it was good but I have \u00a0had better lobster bisque than this at the Luxor steakhouse. It was not as creamy as I would have looked but there was plenty of lobster in it and that was good. It was not bad just not that best. For dessert I went with the caramel cheesecake. It was a hard choice because they have an awesome dessert menu. It was a good choice though. It was downright decadent! It had a perfect mix of caramel and cheesecake flavor. Neither one was overbearing. It was rich and creamy. Every bite was pure heaven! That meal was more than enough to fill me up. Not only was the food amazing but so was the customer service. Since I was dining solo I ate at the bar. My server JT was great. He engaged me in great conversation about where we both come from and how he ended up living in Vegas.

You see how I just got smart with words? Just there? Get it? Mistake / Steak? You see, it seems that once you have been to the mountain top, its hard to go slum it in rougher strung out pawn shop parts of the valley, so I made a last minute and very decisive decision as my executive brain is wired to do... we are going to Craftsteak... nothing less will suffice. Just because one is in Vegas... one need not roll the dice when it comes to dinner. Am I right? Or am I right? Your so right Mr. Papageorgio. Anyway, while I have been to the location in LA, I had not yet been to the one in Vegas, and my foodie instincts told me that it would be just as good. And not surprisingly, I was right.Now, just to get it out of the way, I will quickly cover the negatives:1) As compared to the exceptional service interactions we had with virtually every single person we came across working in Vegas on the trip, the hostess the night we went, I believe Sunday May 18, 2014, was leaning toward the rude / I'm totally over doing this job / I'm tired of being nice to people who think they can win me over side of things.... you get the point. 2) While the food is great, well prepared, etc, its a bit of a departure from the type of fare one would consider to be tough to replicate at home if they had seriously good taste, access to a quality grocer, and an ability to prepare food properly... its rather, basic, I'm sure by design... and it lacks that \"over the top\" quality one might hope for, but in no way does it disappoint. To the contrary, it satisfies. That concludes the negative as I don't hold the restaurant accountable for attracting a lot of drunk DB's who eat like they are in a barn and ask for ketchup. Now, on to the good:1) We ate at the bar which was a much more intimate experience both between myself and my dining companion, and our bartender / server. Eddie. Who by the way was a true pro... the best of the best. Eddie has been with the restaurant since it opened 11 years ago. He knows what the hell he is doing and he suffers no fools. I hope he is there when I dine there next. He made our night.2) They pour the stiffest drinks imaginable. Perfection.3) While pricey, its actually a great value considering what you get.

Some places that would be thebomb.com in other markets just can't cut the mustard when compared to Vegas Gold Standards like Carne Vino or Outback. IMHO Craftsteak is just such a restaurant- it is pretty good, but given its similar in cost to just about every steak place on the strip it isn't one I would recommend. I always get the same thing first time around- Bone in Ribeye, Potato side, Mac and Cheese- except for they don't have mac and cheese- terrorists win :(. The Steak- the bone in ribeye was mediocre at best. Ordered medium rare the meat was barely pink which was a huge misstep. It didn't have a very good crust and was sort of bland- given how often TC yells at people on Top Chef for incorrectly seasoning, and given it was a steak and should have enough salt on it to choke a deer, this was pretty disappointing. Now again, if this was your first Vegas steak experience you could overlook this and still have a pretty good meal. But if you have been to other great steak restaurants in the area these mistakes become more crushing. Now I will say- their specialty is clearly the more expensive steaks (US and Australian Wagyu, Kobe... or Japanese Wagyu? Does anyone know what these things mean? Nope? Ok I figured). So I will admit the fault could lie with me not going for a big boy steak. Potato Gratin-this was actually pretty top notch. It has a garlic cream sauce that is STRONG so if you are on a date or with a fancy prostitute you may want to stay away.White Corn Grits- I'm from the dirty south so naturally I had to order this. It's not exactly what you would expect if you have been raised on three Michelin star restaurants like Waffle House- but it is chock full of so much bacon and gruyere cheese that you can't really go wrong. DessertThe Monkey Bread is pretty amazing- overall the sides and dessert were the stars of this meal with the steak more of a creepy extra lurking in the corner. If I went back here I would probably skip the steak altogether and get more apps/sides/desserts.", "Date": "2014-05-06", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Hanh H.", "ReviewID": "kZreqSmQNlCY5atrCu7HwQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went here a few nights ago and there was 4 of us for dinner. We couldn't decide on what to order, since everything on the menu looked so good. After much back and forth, we finally decided to get the chef's selection domestic wagyu. For the Chef's selection, the nice thing about it is, you had to order a minimum of 2 orders, but you didn't have to order for one per person if that makes sense. We had 4 people and we did 3 orders of the domestic wagyu plus the lobster bisque. We didn't know what we were going to get, so it was all a surprise. The plate of warm salted bread came out first and I thought that was okay, it was very soft, but it tasted a little dry. Next came out the lobster bisque, even though we just ordered one, our waiter brought out a small bowl for the other 3 to try as well, so I thought that was really nice of him. Next came our appetizers, we had a salad, heirloom tomatoes and there was one more dish, but I can't seem to remember what it was. After the appetizers came our steak, we got 3 different cuts, the filet mignon, the skirt steak and the rib eye with 3 sides, the potato puree, the brentwood corn (YUM!) and then assorted mushrooms. My favorite was by far the filet mignon, it was so tender, I could cut it with the back of my knife. The skirt steak had a great flavor to it and I think our ribeye may have been cooked medium well, vs the medium rare that we ordered. We didn't finish our steak between 4 people, we were pretty stuffed already and no one really knew if we were getting dessert. 5 minutes later we got 5 dessert dishes, boy were we in for something we couldn't finish. We got an assorted ice cream, mixed fruits, creme brulee, a chocolate cake and finally monkey bread. After this meal I think we all had food coma! I would definitely come back here! the food is so delicious and I think I would probably try a different chef's selection next time.", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "Hayward, CA"}, {"Author": "Karla S.", "ReviewID": "bpm-AQn0TtAqRxJj7EowNw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I warn you my review may not necessarily represent the main reason you'd come here for: STEAK.

It was very good though! I discovered that I really like pickled white anchovies! We each ordered a medium-rare filet mignon for our main course. I ordered a side of risotto, and my husband ordered a side of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Now -those- were some large portions!I didn't care much for the risotto. I think it was underdone. The mushrooms were good. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and were tasty, but I'd had -much- better at Annie's Paramount Steakhouse on 17th Street in Washington DC just a few days before.

I am a big top chef fan and wanted to try Tom Colicchio's restaurant knowing it would be awesome considering how high his standards are. I went in with high expectations to this dinner and let me just say that this restaurant surpassed my expectations. I can't say enough good things about my experience at Craftsteak. First, we had the chilled oysters. AMAZING. I wanted 100 more of them! If you're a seafood person like myself then starting off with these is an excellent choice. They are light and won't fill you up. I had read on Craftsteak's website that the lobster bisque was one of their signature items and now I know why. Wow. It was mouth watering. Hands down one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life and I've eaten some pretty amazing food. I was blown away. You can't come to this restaurant and not order this item. For my entree, I ordered the flat iron steak. It was cooked to perfection, no surprise there. I could have cut my steak with my fork; that's how tender it was. It was absolutely delicious. But what really blew me away was the risotto. I could eat that risotto every day for the rest of my life. They should put the risotto as one of their signature items if they haven't already. Aside from the spectacular food, the service was IMPECCABLE. Our server was so kind, so efficient, and just wonderful. Not only was our server terrific, but the busser and the person who ran out the food to us were so polite and nice as well. I've never had such good service before. We got drinks at the bar before our dinner and the bartenders were awesome as well. Also, the ambiance is lovely. I loved the interior. I wanted an amazing dinner in Vegas and that was what I got an then some. Tom Colicchio has high standards as a judge on top chef and those high standards show in his restaurant as well.

We all decided to do the domestic wagyu tasting menu ($145/person). Our total bill came to be about $1,500 after tax & tip w/ wine and other drinks included. IT WAS SO TOTALLY WORTH IT! To be honest, my expectations weren't too high for Crafsteak, but I left mindblown (my stomach was goin to explode too LOL). We basically had a feast fit for way more than 8 people. Service and food were excellent!! Overall it was3 courses and for each course, the servers came out with the dishes in symphony.They start you off w/ their addicting bread which I regret eating so much of because it filled up my stomach space. The bread comes out hot & fresh in a rectangle cast iron skillet. The butter is sooo good w/ the bread. It's some sort of hawaiian roll w/ sea salt sprinkled on top. So buttery, rich, fluffy, and flavorful w/ a hint of sweetness. We got 2 rounds of bread cause it was so goodFirst Course: Salads & appsCaesar Salad - Unique twist to a classic salad. The romaine lettuces were left full in leaf form rather than cut. The dressing wasn't heavy and the minced anchovies weren't overpowering.Baby Bibb - the buttermilk blue cheese & bacon complemented the salad very well. Normally my bf & I don't like blue cheese, but the way it was incorporated in this dish made it light and tasty.Avocado Salad - Light lemon vinaigrette dressing and PLENTY of avocado fans. The avocados were all ripe and smooth as a baby's butt.Hand cut Wagyu tartare- I LOVE TARTARE and I totally could have eaten this w/out the crostini. There's also a small raw quail yolk right in the middle of the tartare. I liked eating this app w/ the bread they provided in the beginningProscuitto San Daniele - KILL ME. The best proscuitto I've had. Not overly salty and it was delicious w/ the pears. It tasted even better wrapped around the cheese garlic breadsticks providedShrimp cocktail - fresh plump shrimp, but it was like any other shrimp cocktailProscuitto Risotto - OMFG the risotto is THE BEST I've ever had. OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING. It contained english peas and scallions mixed in. The risotto had that creamy rich texture that just melts in your mouth. I couldn't stop eating this, had to force myself to stop so that I could share it w/ the rest of the table.Potato Puree - Yukon GOLD POTATOES!! It was really creamy/smooth. I actually prefer this over Joel Robuchon's mashed potatoes.For the vegetables we had asparagus, baby carrots w/ honey, snap peas w/ romesco & shallots, Mushroom assortment, Zucchini w/ maui onions. All of the vegetables were cooked perfectly. My fav were the assorted mushrooms (it included all the mushrooms like shiitake, french horn, etc) & baby carrots. The only bad dish of the night were the french fries. They weren't crispy enough2nd Course: MEATSWe basically had a whole cow on the table. Overall 8 cast iron dishes of diff cuts were laid out at the table. Half cooked medium rare and half medium. Each one had a nice beautiful red warm center w/ the perfect outside searNY strip - normally I don't like NY strip 'cause it's too lean and dry, but the NY strip cut here was my 2nd fav of the meat dishes! It looked lean, but was really juicy and soft yet flavorfulOutside skirt - #1 fav for the table. This was the only plate that was gone at the end of the night. It was so melt in your mouth delicious! Tender and savory, best outside skirt I've hadRibeye - lots of fat, but was a bit more chewy than the other cutsFilet Mignon - Not as tender as most filet mignons I've had, was my 4th fav dish.Flat Iron - my 3rd fav dish! Came in a huge plate and we killed half of it. It was similar in taste to the outside skirt, but not quite as tender/softPorterhouse - 4th fav dish of the night! Oh man for a dry aged steak, it was delish. My friend has had their porterhouse at Crafsteak in NY and said it tasted just as good as the NY location.3rd course: DessertsIce cream - Banana, Pistachio, white chocolate, and mixed berry swirl, and raspberry sorbet. The sorbet was a bit sour, I enjoyed the ice creams more especially pistachioCinnamon Monkey bread - I was so excited to try this since everyone kept talking about it. For some reason it didn't get topped w/ vanilla ice cream, but it was still good. The pecan toffee sauce made it addicting. This tastes basically like a cinnamon roll, but not as sweetChocolate Indulgence - Chocolate cake w/ caramel on the bottom. It was just okCaramel Cheesecake - Light & airy, but I prefer Capital Grille's cheesecake.Apple caramel tart - Was basically like an apple pie tart. It wasn't overly sweet and the crust just lightly crumbles in your mouth. Loved itFarmers Market Fruit - Everyone's favorite! Came w/ an assortment of fresh fruits.

It's gotta be special. Craft was, indeed, special.I had the task of trying to find somewhere for a business/client dinner after a conference day. We decided on steak, so I looked for steakhouses in Vegas. Of course I love Tom Colicchio, so I figured Craftsteak had to be a good bet, coupled with other Yelp reviews, I made my choice.From calling to set up the reservation for 11, to arriving and being greeted, seated, and served, the entire experience was fantastic. I was not disappointed in one single thing.The 11 of us opted to order separate entrees and a bevvy of sides to share. I'll get to that in a minute. First, I want to comment on the Dark and Stormy that I ordered. One of my favorite drinks, a close second to the Moscow Mule, this one was hands down one of the best drinks I've ever had. Try it, prove me wrong.As far as food, I ordered a fresh mozzarella with tomato and balsamic reduction appetizer, and it was creamy, fresh and delicious. \u00a0I also wanted to try the famed Hangar steak after hearing a co-worker rave about it. It was every bit as good as he made it out to be. Tender, yet packed full of flavor. Not too fatty, but not too lean. I could have cut it with a fork, and I'd order it again if I ever get the opportunity. The sides I tried, from the french fries to the grits to the sunchokes, were all super. After dinner, we of course had to have dessert. I opted for the tropical sorbet, and the mix of passion fruit and mango was so flavorful, I didn't want to share it. I also tried the monkey bread, amazing as well.Bottom line. Worth it. Worth every penny.

Of the sides, I enjoyed the pureed potato the most.The deserts were good, but overkill after all of that. Not a bad deal though.My biggest gripe is with their sommelier and their wine list.

Blank Angus under the 'Roasted' section, was prepared to perfection. \u00a0It was prepared the way I would do it at home: \u00a0butterflied, one side crusted with crushed peppercorns and coarse salt, pan seared, and then finished (most likely) in the oven. \u00a0The accompanying pan sauce -- not listed or described on the menu -- was rich and savory (I actually wished there was a bit more).Finally, choosing a suitable dessert wasn't difficult: \u00a0the Chocolate Souffle with Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream was the very center selection listed on the Dessert menu. \u00a0I have made dozens of chocolate souffles at home, and I was curious how Craftsteak was going to pull it off. \u00a0Was it going to be crusty, like a hot, just-baked chocolate cake? \u00a0Or was it going to be soupy, like a hot pudding?

It was very quiet, and romantic.We each ordered the Chef's 3 course meal(must have at least 2 people). We went with the American Wagyu for $140 each. And it was worth every penny. We started off with an appetizer, we had the Hand-cut Wagyu Tartare which was delicious. I have never had tartare before, and we both loved it. We also got our choice of 3 of the salad choices. We had the Italian Buffalo Mozzarella, Roasted Red Peppers and the Wild Arugula. They were all fantastic, but I think the Buffalo Mozzarella was my favorite(which included a roasted red pepper relish, which was fantastic). Then came the steaks. Oh man, the steaks. We both got the American Wagyu which comes from Snake River Farms in Idaho. I had the New York Strip and my boyfriend had the Rib eye. They were cooked perfectly and so, so delicious. Each cut was 14 oz, and I couldn't even finish it. I felt weird leaving behind delicious, expensive steak. With our steak we also got our choice of 3 sides. We had the Mushroom Assortment, Potato Gratin and White Corn Grits \u00a0with Bacon, Gruyere, Chives. They were all good, but once again we had a favorite: White Corn Grits. We polished these off. The addition of the bacon and Gruyere was amazing. After eating ALL OF THE FOOD. We also got a tasting selection of desserts including the Cinnamon Monkey Bread, Vanilla Cheesecake, Farmers Market Fruit and ice cream and sorbet. At this point we could barely even touch the food, but it was all very tasty. Our favorite was the Monkey Bread(which we surprisingly somehow managed to finish, probably because it was delicious, but also because we are fatties).

This could be a five star experience, however there were some service issues that bothered me.For instance, while the service was good per se, and professional, it was also a little stuffy and curt. Again, I felt as if a case of reverse age discrimination was in effect just because me and my dining partners look young and were a bit rowdy and loud as the night wore on, we were written off as poor customers. Excuse me but between the eight of us we probably know more about wine, food and service than most working at Craft, but whatever. Just don't speak to me like I'm an idiot. Hate that.There were several attempts at choreographed drops and pick ups of food at the table and all staff members were clearly not on the same page and it made for some uncomfortable glares across the table as well. Awkward. Really? Instead of just dropping my food when it's hot, standing there till everyone is ready? I get it, I really do, but it was a little much. It's not a Justin Timberlake concert or the NYC Ballet, it's running food. Gimme it. Drop it. I'm hungry!For a party of eight doing a tasting menu on a reservation, and having industry connections, I thought we would have been shown a little more hospitality as was the case up and down the Strip all month. I believe we all felt the experience was a little rushed. Not only did support staff hover around the table but before you could put your fork down from your last bite your plate was being whisked away and the next course being rushed out.Another issue.. I don't know if this is just our server or everyone at the restaurant, but aggressively filling the bottled water and bring refills of cocktails without asking Is inappropriate. I've worked in Michelin starred restaurants, \u00a0I've worked at a Texas Roadhouse. I don't care where you are, you ask before bringing it. Maybe I didn't WANT five Dark and Stormies?Anyway, aside from the rushed, curt service and blatant money grabs, the food was outstanding, the space is beautiful and that's why this place gets four stars. We started out with six interesting 2006/8 Italian blends and a enjoyed a big, beautiful, \u00a0Bordeaux for dinner, but we never saw the Som, or we probably would've ordered more. Again, was it our Age?We all ordered the American Wagyu tasting menu. From the brief, rushed description by our waiter, we were to get three courses. \u00a0For the first course, appetizers disjointedly flooded the table, and I recall the Handcut Wagyu Tartar as a standout amongst them. I recall also, the risotto underwhelming most at our table.As second course, I remember trying numerous salads.. my favorites being the Italian buffalo mozzarella, pork belly, and pan roasted red pepper. As the steaks rolled out, so did that lovely Bordeaux.. I wish I could remember the name of it, but I was three or four dark and stormy's deep, not to mention all that wine?Steaks.. 14 oz pieces of marbled, juicy heaven from Snake River Farms, all varying cuts. As I mentioned there are a lot of places to get $150 steak in Las Vegas.. Carnevino, STK, Jean George's, Strip steak, Delmonico, Gordon Ramsay.. and of them all, Craft Steak is probably one of my top.. two or three.A bunch of the usual sides were at the table but all I remember are the white corn grits. Oh god.. white corn, bacon, Gruyere, and chives and oh my God I could've eaten four more bowls.Again before I could even rest my fork, my plate was being whisked way and dessert was brought out. Awkward.A TON of delicious food hit the table for dessert, along with some nice Ruby Port. Cinnamon Monkey Bread, Vanilla Cheesecake, Farmers Market Fruit, Ice Creams, and Spicy Sorbet. Well, that was a nice surprise. So the meal ended up being a pretty good deal now that I think about it.. considering my steak alone would've been $105.00 plus the appetizers, salads, sides, and dessert. Well we ended up ordering ton of wine and a bunch of cocktails so I guess the restaurant made out well, too. If Craftsteak figures out their service glitches and hires some people that want to sell instead of take orders and make sure the Sommelier hits every table, they'd have a five-star restaurant.

We split the lobster bisque to start, which was good, but cannot compare to Kokomo's (which is now closed to make room for Tom's Heritage Steak BOO). I didn't like the large pieces of tarragon on top, which feels like chewing on pieces of grass, but it was tolerable.

We chose the Domestic Wagyu beef tasting at $140/person. A bit expensive of course, but we wanted to splurge so we did it despite our better judgement. First of all, if this is the route you plan to take, please make sure you arrive with an empty stomach. The portion sizes would make Mr. Buca Di Beppo blush. As part of the tasting, you are allowed (I say allowed b/c the chef is rather particular about what and how you order) to order appetizers, salads, two steak options, of which you cannot order the same cut and a dessert accompaniment. Yes, that much food!!Cow:The steaks were prepared medium and arrived a little closer to medium rare. I am fine with it, but my lady doesn't like it too rare. I mean, could we send it back? Of course. But it would be nice if they just follow what's ordered. Sides: Potato Gratin was ok. I hate this dish simply b/c made at home or at a high end restaurant, it doesn't matter. Once you cut into it you either need to eat every bite within moments or deal with the fact that it solidifies quickly and no longer tastes the way it should. Mushrooms were a huge hit, for me at least. Roasted, seasoned well and delicious!! Baby carrots were, well baby carrots. Dessert:Selections were incredible! Choco indulgence was my second fave. Chocolate mousse covered with chocolate ganache and served with house made chocolate ice cream. However, this took a back seat to their Monkeybread.

The server was just alright, he explained the menu very quickly that we both were kinda lost on how the three course menu work. I felt like he shouldn't be in a hurry in explaining the menu, especially because we told him that it was our first time dining there. We have to ended up calling him back to explain it again. Thoroughly.We got the domestic wagyu three course meal, and we wanted to get ribeye for both of us but he said that you can't have the same cut of steak in a table, which is weird. So we settled with New York and ribeye cuts. We are allowed to choose 2 salads and 3 sides. We got a wagyu beef tartar and a shrimp cocktail. The tartar was quite amazing (that was my first time eating it), the shrimps in the cocktail was huge and plump, the mozzarella salad was quite yummy and the pork belly salad was just ok (nothing special). When the steaks arrived I realized that my ribeye was missing the fatty ring around it, which usually makes the steak much more juicier. I was a little sad, but my fianc\u00e9's New York steak looks amazing! So I just let it go and moved on to try the sides. The Chanterelles mushroom was delish, the potato gratin was creamy and yummy, but the risotto was too cheesy and looked almost like Mac and cheese. We finished everything except the risotto, which was disappointing. We were stuffed at this point and we almost forgot about the desserts. The desserts were chef's choice, so we didn't know what we were getting. The brought out 4 plates of dessert! Wow. We got the monkey bread with caramel and vanilla ice cream, the chocolate peanut butter mousses with chocolate ice cream, white chocolate ice cream and spicy (fruit) sorbet and a plate of mixed fresh fruits. We really liked the monkey bread and the mousse, but the spicy sorbet was bland.

Craftsteak risotto was very heavy and I didnt like the gritty texture. No dinner is complete without Dessert!We got the Earl Grey Ice Cream and Strawberry Ice Cream- I love Earl Grey ice cream, its one of my favorite flavor. As well as Lavender.

Nothing too striking or amazing about the decor. Started with bread served in a cast iron skillet. Very good bread resembling a Hawaiian roll. I was hoping for a chef's selection or menu but they only have that for two or more (curses to traveling alone).My waiter recommended the scallops for an appetizer. For my first bite I experienced amazingly buttery scallops with a seasoned buttery flavor. However, when I finished my first scallop (of three) I found myself shifting from amazement to indifference to slight disapproval of the (basil?) herb and lemon undertone. The more I ate the more flavors I cTo me, I felt that the scallops on their own were so amazing, a simple butter sauce would be perfect with a tiny squeeze of lemon. But that's just me...I ordered the domestic Wagyu ribeye. It was a pretty bad steak. I read all the reviews of how amazing this place was so I came ready for a delicious experience and was quite disappointed. Uninspired was the word that came to mind. The beef had a dual personality. One side was rough and chewy. Chewy. It was a perfectly cooked medium but one side had a somewhat decent texture but the other end was downright ... Chewy. I didn't even finish my steak it was that bad. And this wasn't bad \"for Wagyu\". It was bad for steak. I've had way better steaks at Outback for fractions of the $105 price tag. For sides, I ordered spinach but was brought half corn and half spinach. Thanks GOODNESS for the corn!! The spinach was plain and boring. But once I had a bite of corn it almost made up for everything else. It was unbelievable!!!!! It reminded me of a gourmet BBQ. An assortment of flavors that WOWed me. I spoke up and the manager brought me a domestic Wagyu filet mignon. I'm writing to here so I haven't gotten it yet. The manager said he understood my taste on the steak is mine and valid. I appreciate how he tactfully said \"these are amazingly expensive steaks so I don't know WTF your taste buds are telling you\". Kudos to the politically savvy manager. I can only really compare my experience to mine at Sage a few months ago. It was a completely different experience from start to finish. I felt like I was in a luxury restaurant. I think 50 people came by my table every 45 seconds. Here, I felt almost like I was on an island. I guess I feel the same way about the MGM Grand Hotel that I do about craftsteak. It is nice but there are better, fancier, deliciouser places costing less. I'm still waiting for my replacement steak. I really would rather just pay the full check, leave, and chalk it up to a bad experience I probably wouldn't repeat (even if this was an off night and I got that one bad steak). As I sit here thinking, I think back to discussions I've had about what differentiates a professional from an amateur (other than money). A professional is consistent. Sure, amateurs may make a great play, take an amazing photo, or cook a great meal but it takes a professional to do it to a level of quality day in and day out. A bad day for a professional is still usually better than most amateurs. So even if this steak was an anomaly, a place of this caliber should not have too many nights that are this bad. With all that said and done, I will give this place a 3 instead of a 2 because I'm hoping they are usually much better and one poor review shouldn't dissuade anyone from trying them out. Now, if they have a bad experience then they can rate them a 2...OK I just finished my replacement filet. A finish able steak. Still don't feel it was worth the money but at least this was a good steak.When I got the bill, I was disappointed that the manager did not discount anything.

Out of the seafood she recommended the halibut or scallops (should've went with the scallops).The ribeye was ookay. \u00a0It was pretty chewy and and parts of it were really difficult to cut with the knife. It seemed a tad over medium rare, but I could not understand why it felt kind of stringy. \u00a0They cut it for us so maybe they didn't let it rest enough? I have no idea. \u00a0For the price, we expected perfection and I could've easily made something more tasty and tender :/Also no sides come with it.Halibut was overcooked. \u00a0I was so excited to see what perfect halibut tasted like. The buttery sauce was tasty, but couldn't really overlook the dry stringiness. \u00a0I was full after the steak and really should've just left it alone, it wasn't really enjoyable to eat. \u00a0I mean, it even -looked- overcooked when we got it. \u00a0We also got the arugula salad, which wasn't mindblowing. It was fresh, it was okaay. I had to have some grass to munch on.In hindsight I should've a) sent back both dishes or at least the halibut (but we were running late so didn't want to wait for a new order, and the dinnermate had finished half the halibut already & we were pretty full already) and b) ordered the 24 hr braised short ribs (because it would seriously take skill to get that wrong), but my dinner mate doesn't like ribs. (WHAT THE FK I cannot even comprehend and must rethink the relationship. \u00a0Infuriating.

Before I start explaining the food, they provide you with AMAZING dinner roll...that I simply claim that I would come back just to eat dinner rolls. The dinner roll was so soft that I didnt think bread can have this kind of melting texture with some sea salt on top. You can add their butter to it to make it even more amazing(but it would taste amazing even without it). Yes...I ate 5 and yes my waiter asked me if I wanted more and my answer is obvious. I had it for breakfast the next day when I was a bit buzz...microwaved it for 15 secs soooo goood still.Back to topic, you won't feel ripped off when you get the dinner for $140 set because it comes with A LOT. There are 2 salads, prosciutto AND the most amazing of all the Beef tar tare which is WOW....they give you two toasted bread which was toasted perfectly. I don't know what to say because it was that gooddddd. Omg... I want some right now. Came with 4 steaks which all of them were REALLY GOOD. YOu can tell how good the quality of the steaks are but my favorite is the skirt steak. That is just me of course. They already cut the steaks for you which you would think that all the juices will be good but it isnt...Regardless if you haven't had it you might want to try the $140 deal once(or any other deals they have )The crazy part was that we were so full before we even finished the steaks...(must be the dinner rolls :p) but we barely could hold our ground after finishing the entrees. \u00a0The waiter came with 3 desserts at first and I was like ah dude...I think we got this.

We did the Chef's Beef selection which allowed us to sample a lot of different things from the menu. We LOVED the rolls that came out prior to our meal -- they were crispy on the outside and so soft inside with a hint of salt on the outside. Our first course came out -- we sample the Prosciutto, the baby bibb (which was my fave), shrimp cocktail, and the persian cucumber salad. Our second course ( we were able to pick 2 meats) so we did the domestic wagyu ribeye and filet mignon. Our sides were potatoes gratin, risotto and carrots. The meats were cooked perfectly and tasted so sublime. Our favorite side was the potatoes gratin but the risotto and carrots were yummy as well. Finally, our final course was dessert!! We sampled the cinnamon monkey bread (my husbands favorite), two sorbets, a caramel cheesecake (my favorite), and fruit sampler. The Chef's Beef selection was great because we sampled a lot of what was on the menu however it was slightly more pricey than just ordering a few things that we were interested in. We came back to Craftsteak another night we were in LV (that's how much we loved it!) and we just ordered what we liked and it was about $50-70 cheaper. That night I had the wagyu skirt steak which was also super yummy but a little too buttery for my liking. My husband had the regular filet mignon (non-wagyu) and he could tell a big difference in the meats. The second time around we tried the chocolate souffle which was good but no where near as yummy as the cheesecake or monkey bread. Over all we had a great experience both times we were there - both with service and food. The ambiance is somewhere between casual and romantic.

Our experience here wasn't as enjoyable.We decided to give it a try Wednesday night. Having looked on opentable the day or so prior, it seemed like there were plenty of times available so I didn't bother making a reservation. When we arrived at 8:15, we were told the soonest we could be seated was 9:30.We decided to look elsewhere to eat. While doing so, out of curiosity I decided to take a peak at my opentable app and was able to book a reservation at 8:45, which caused us some confusion. Why couldn't they have booked this reservation at the hostess desk? We show back up at 8:45, were seated within a minute, and walked by several open tables at the bar which we specificied earlier would have been fine. Kind of left a bad taste in our mouths to start. Every time we've gone to Craftsteak at Foxwoods, we'd share the wagyu ribeye and it was easily the best steak I've ever had, every time. Worth every penny of the $100+. We ordered what we assumed was the same waygu ribeye, but it was unmistakably different. It was the leanest ribeye I've ever had, from the Texas Roadhouse to Grill 32 Boston. If I was told it was a sirloin, I'd think yeah this pretty good...for a sirloin.The Foxwood's steak was cut to be shared and the marbleization was so extensive the pieces would fall apart as you lifted it, and those smaller pieces would melt in your mouth. A knife was not needed. I did some research, finding the Craftsteak at Foxwoods menu PDF, even though they closed: foxwoods.com/uploadedFil\u2026. They were both 14 oz wagyu ribeyes, but the one at Foxwoods specifies the grade (8) and the farm (Sher Ranch, Australia), and was also $134 vs the $105. We were told by the manager they get their meat from the same farm as the other locations. I didn't have these details at the time, but it didn't matter, it was not comparable. The price different is my only objective evidence of these steaks being of different grades and/or from a different ranch.What saved the rating was the service. We voiced our confusion and slight dissatisfaction, and they were more than willing to replace it but we declined.

And oh man what a wind bag I am with this single post!Was in Vegas for the 4th of July with some of my family and Craftsteak was picked for dinner one night. Now the wife and I are huge fans of the Top Chef series, so we naturally had high expectations for this restaurant. We were under no illusion that good 'ole Tom would be cooking for us,but with his brand stamped on the restaurant, it should have still been outstanding.The breakdown:First course-2 orders of the hand cut Wagyu Tartare - this was fairly tasty but it wasn't outstanding. I would have expected a bit more depth of flavor given it is at minimum a Wagyu/Angus blend.Arugula Salad - simple but very tasty - not the crappy Arugula I get from Trader Joe'sHeirloom Tomato Salad- really just sliced heirloom tomato's, but they were goodBuffalo Mozzarella Salad - I didn't eat this but the sister-in-law seemed pleased with it.Second Course-Porterhouse for two - My wife and I shared this meal (as designed) and we were wholly unimpressed. The meat did have the slight funky essence (a good thing) that comes from dry aging but man was this thing under seasoned. Also, beyond the slight pungency, there was really no other flavor there. I mean, if I can grill a non-prime cut t-bone in my backyard and get more flavor out of it, there is something wrong here. Who knows, maybe an off day or a bad cut, but at $96 that should not have happened.My bro and his wife order the same porterhouse, but ask that after grilling to a med-rare, take 2/3rds of the filet portion and grill to med-well for his wife. They seemed to like their steak (he picked the place so he wouldn't complain :-) but the server totally forgot their instructions and they had to ask them to take the filet portion back to be grilled further. At a place such as this, you should not have a forgetful server.Braised Short Ribs - My other bro ordered this and it was really a knockout. I am not a huge braised meat fan because usually the meat has such an intense wine flavor that it drowns out the meat flavor. This version really had the perfect balance and I can understand why it is a signature dish.SidesBaby Spinach - meh, it is baby spinach with garlic. No real finesse here but edibleBaby Shitake - pretty good flavor, would order again. You really want the mushrooms to shine and I think they accomplished this.White Corn Grits - I love smoky bacon/pig flavor and this had it. The problem is that is all it had - the pork totally overwhelmed the dish..I mean really no balance whatsoever. ServiceI mentioned the slip up earlier, but the service was really not up to par. It seemed like the servers got board of us and were not particularly attentive. I've eaten in some very suspect joints in my life, but in those cases I expect little or no service. Here, it should have been top notch and it was not. I don't want to feel like I was bothering the server, but that is what we all felt like at the end of the meal.I might consider going here again just to see if this was really an off night or if it was par for the course, but there are so many other options in Vegas I cannot really see that happening.

We narrowed down our choices from (Delmonico, Mastros (we ate at the one in LA last year) and Craftsteak).We eventually settled on Craftsteak mainly because it had the most reviews (vs Delmonico) & Mastros was in an odd setting (in a mall), Do I think we made the right decision with Craftsteak?ABSOLUTELY. It was perfect from start to finish. We were running a tad late for our reservation so I called in advance to let the hostess know and she graciously seated us as soon as we arrived. The ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful.It didn't even feel like we were in a casino, which I worried about.We both started with starters:I had the Cesar salad & my boyfriend had the lobster bisque. The Cesar salad was just okay for me. I feel the price was steep for a salad (about the same for lobster bisque)-- & the anchovies weren't very good. The lobster bisque however was so good. Warm, decadent, and great presentation. The server brought out a bowl of chopped lobster and poured the soup over table side. The rolls were also very good. They reminded me of Hawaiian rolls, freshly baked with sea salt. I wish they asked if we wanted more because we gobbled them down quite quickly. For our main courses we ordered the rib eye and the scallops and the pureed potatoes.We shared everything. It was all cooked perfectly. The steak was perfectly juicy throughout. And the scallops were so evenly salted and cooked. The pureed mashed potatoes melted in your mouth like butter. The whole dinner was a complete experience. We wish we saved room for dessert.

The duck portion was rather large, but the skin was not crispy and the cherries that accompanied the dish were too tart.

It has the tenderness of a filet with the flavor of a rib eye.Other items that shouldn't be missed include their sweet corn, potato puree, and roasted baby beets. The sea scallops and 24 hour short rib are also amazing. The real showstopper (besides the skirt steak) is the cinnamon monkey bread. I've heard others rave about it and now I know why. It's like the most delicious bread pudding you can have that has been topped with a sinfully sweet pecan toffee accompanied by brown sugar sour cream ice cream.After two amazing meals this place is back up there with my other favorite steakhouses.

Committed to making the most of this experience, my friend and I boldly opted for the Domestic Waygu 3-course meal for two from the Chef's Beef Selection tasting menu, but we had no idea what we were in for :-OAlthough completely open to deferring to the Chef's choice, we were slightly hesitant about not having the opportunity to taste some of the menu items that spoke to us upon first glance. Our server immediately put us at ease by asking about our likes and dislikes....thus the adventure began! Our meal started with the signature house dinner rolls. Light and fluffy with the familiar comfort that can only come from yeast, these rolls were served piping hot and lightly dusted with coarse sea salt.Next were our appetizers:the lobster bisque was rich, creamy and meaty - \u00a0everything you want in this decadent soup. A perfectly fresh wild arugula salad with cucumbers and red onions in a refreshing lime vinaigrette. Prosciutto served with fig marmalade...need I say more? Buffalo mozzarella topped with roasted hazelnuts and roasted red pepper caponata...ummmm cheese, hello! Honestly we probably could have stopped here and been content but alas that was not the case.....bring on the beef! Our waygu beef entrees and their accompanying sides as chosen by the Chef were: the 14 oz. grilled skirt steak in a delicious bordelaise (red wine reduction and veal stock) sauce with cipollini onions was super tender and naturally flavorful. The 10 oz. roasted filet mignon was truly \"melt in your mouth\" perfection. The \u00a0baby spinach in garlic oil, mushroom assortment (Shimeji white beach, morel, french horn and hen of the woods) and creamy grits with bacon and gruy\u00e8re cheese left us stuffed beyond words. Yet there was one more course awaiting us.For dessert, we were served: plum and raspberry sorbet, an assorted fruit tray, peanut butter mousse covered in chocolate with salted caramel peanut brittle and cinnamon ice cream on a bed of chopped peanuts (which my friend loved) and my absolute fav of the four: cinnamon brioche monkey bread with chopped walnuts, caramel sauce and brown sugar sour cream ice cream. Yumtastic is a understatement!After such an incredible meal, we still had plenty of leftovers.

I was really torn trying to decide which of the many steakhouses in Las Vegas to visit. I think on my next trip though, I probably will not make a stop at Craftsteak. The food is definitely good, but not quite on par with other steakhouses in the area. When we first arrived, we had a reservation, and it wasn't particularly packed, but they still asked us to wait. We waited in the bar for a while, but it got pretty warm, so we decided to step outside. When we stepped outside, the manager up front said good bye to us, and we had to tell him that we weren't leaving, and that we were waiting to be seated. He kind of looked surprised, and within a minute or so, asked us to follow him into the restaurant. Not a great start, but we didn't really mind - just a little strange. The food was good, but again, nothing special. We both ordered the ribeye, and although they were in the pan, we found that the steaks got cold rather quickly. The sides that we ordered were also nothing out of the ordinary. I did however, enjoy my Caesar salad. I thought the presentation with whole leaves of lettuce unsliced and whole anchovies on top was kind of cool and tasty. And of course, the monkey bread was fantastic.But once inside, the service was great, and the decor was nice.

Almost everything we ordered was amazing. The mood of the restaurant was a downer on the night that we went. No subtle mood music, in fact, I was more aware of the staffs conversations then what was going on with my party.Onto the positives! The Kumamoto oysters are ordered individually and were delicious. They come with the traditional mignonette, horseradish, lemon, and cocktail sauce. The steak tartare is a staple for my group now. We are trying to find the best in Vegas. Tom Colicchio has a solid one, but not the best. The flavor components are sound, but something more impressive than a plain crostini is needed. The stand out appetizer was the warm friscee salad with blue cheese vin and a poached egg. All very simple ingredients that combine to make magic. Once the salad is tossed and the egg broken, it adds another dimension to the dish. I have never been more dissatisfied with dining family style. I wanted it all to myself.Moving on to the 8oz of Australian wagyu. It is seriously butter. It melts in your mouth and makes you go limp. At a hefty price tag, it is still worth it. The filet and New York strip were delicious, but pale in comparison to the wagyu. The rack of lamb comes in four pieces and marbled to perfection. No need for forks and knives, they are to be treated as lollipops once my party got to them. The diver scallops are tender and the fennel salad compliments them so well. The yukon gold mashed potato is what everyone raves about. Are they good? Hell yes, please keep dishing it out. The assorted mushrooms are rather dreamy as well. The Maui onions could keep on coming. \u00a0The one downer were the grits. They sounded awesome but fell short.

Over-sized margaritas and cold beer are keeping my mind sane and calm, so many colors, sparkles, beautiful women, shows, bright lights, moving objects with sounds. Like any other simple boy, I am a sucker for these things.Can not drive the convertible obviously, the fuzz in my head is remarkable. It almost feels like, I am listening to Arabic hip-hop and wandering around a desert, lost and hopeless. Get a cab or a camel and go for dinner. I desperately in need of \u00a0heavy protein intake. The cab line-up, reading the guide, saw a familiar name. Tom Colicchio. I like his TV personality, looks like a good guy. Don't think too much, hop on the good foot and do the bad thing. Here we go.The restaurant is just beautiful, modern and relaxed. Friendly in a very sleek way which is a perfect set up for a steakhouse. Steakhouses should not be intimidating. Sat at the bar, you know what, let's do beer tonight and straight from the bottle. All classics are on the menu. Most of the items are 3 ingredients only. Good sign, very good sign. Bread rolls; six of them are jumping out of a Lodge's square iron cast pan, reaching up like flowers to the sun, hot, sweet, delicious. Personal favorite; Kushi oysters, small, succulent and creamy. Salad of caesar -must at a steak house-, high in acidity, so fresh, so appropriately done. All the fuzz is gone, I am surprised that everything is flawless, or I am very drunk. Wouldn't know.18 oz, bone-in rib-eye, medium, just because you would like the middle fat cooked through, so it melts on your palate. I usually cut out the cap and eat it separately. That little bit is incredibly flavorsome, should be savored on its own I believe. There she comes, I watch her glide through the dining room on the arms of her handler - and thank god this time it is not a father-, I know she is mine, laying down as beautiful as can be on a oval copper pan, I can hear Etta James in the back of my mind, singing; ''At Last''.The char, the crust, the seasoning, the doneness, no stupid garnishes, no games, NO PRE-CARVING (thank god!) in the kitchen. It is the finest steak I have ever had in a restaurant. I am about to burst into tears, I am pretty sure I am not drunk... It is so good, so good, so, so good. As I was dealing with all the emotions, my enthusiasm attracts attention, couple seat over an indistinct chatter; '' I want whatever he is having''. Halfway through this experience I realized I had mashed-potatoes or the potato puree as a side. The word ''puree'' is not clicking with me for some reason, reminds me of baby food or something whipped heavily because it is not presentable on its natural form. Anyway one fork in, I stalled.When you go to culinary school, in most of the classes, smoothness, shapes, colors, uniformity are more pronounced by the instructors instead of the actual flavor factor. That is why cooks are more obsessed with the doneness and composition rather than the flavor I think. This potato dish was bursting with the sweetness of a properly made mash. It is not as creamy or silky and nor it should be as you would find in other fine food establishments, but extraordinary. The starch of the potato is cooked through so there is no residue on your palate, it swallows very clean. Seasoning is perfect, and I mean perfect. I am overwhelmed, I can not take it anymore. I can not go back to other mashed potatoes! My whole take of mash is changed with my first bite. I suspect if they used fingerlings, it tastes so. I forgot about the steak already.After that day, I have changed the way I make mashed potatoes. I started cooking them in skins, peel hot, add appropriate amount of butter until the tightness of the mash is almost gone and emulsify with hot milk, season. Cream, screw cream, not only it dilutes the potato flavor, but it gives a thick body to the puree. I think smooth substances should be lightened up with liquids with low-viscosity, so they loose that gunky palate feel.I step out, completely transformed, happy, satisfied. Now I need an 32 oz margarita to wind down. Hands down it was one of the best meals I have ever had.

It was so smooth, creamy, and flavorful with a sprinkling of chives! The biffalo mozzarella was also delicious. The tapenade on top with hazelnuts complemented it well. My friend enjoyed her flat iron steak. She was in beef heaven! She also had a dark and stormy, which is some kind of cocktail with ginger beer. It reminded me of a moscow mule. My salmon dish was pretty good, but not spectacular. It was a pretty thick filet with a nice crust on a bed of swiss chard.For dessert, we had the cinnamon monkey bread. I was so full, but did have a bite of the ice cream with caramel sauce. While the ice cream was tasty, the sauce was way too sweet! I couldn't handle anymore and didn't even bother to eat the cinnamon bread, which was drenched in the caramel sauce.It's a very expensive restaurant with excellent service and a nice wine list. We were seated at a table that was perfect for people watching. My friends and I did notice the fairly large number of men that were there in groups. And they didn't look like bachelor party type guys either. They were older gentlemen in nice attire, drinking wine and enjoying their meat. Totally right up my friend's alley!

Not one dish disappointed me. I've had many meals in my life and this one now ranks as the biggest and best yet. The salads were great. The meat was juicy and melted in my mouth. The sides were fantastic and the desserts were mind blowing. I did have some favorites, which I'll list below. My favorite dishes in the first course were the tartare and the warm Fris\u00e9e salad.My favorite dishes in the second course were the Wagyu ribeye and the Yukon Gold Puree (best mashed potatoes EVER). My favorite dessert was the cinnamon monkey bread.The service here was top notch. We had two separate servers, both of whom were friendly and attentive. Both answered any questions we asked and trust me, we had a few. \u00a0The price for the Wagyu tasting menu was $140 a person, which was not bad considering the massive amount of incredible food we received. In all honesty, I could not afford to do this on a weekly (or even monthly) basis but since I got lucky the night before at the Roulette tables, this meal only set me back about thirty dollars of my own money. Thanks, Vegas. If you ever have the opportunity to dine at Craftsteak, even if you can't afford a steak tasting (tastings start at $100 a person), then just order off their regular menu.

It had nothing to do with the service, because the service was fine. It was the food that made my visit unpleasant. The meal started off with rolls being served. They looked like Hawaiian roles, but not as sweet...and not as good. Next was the main course. I ordered the bone in rib-eye and a side of the gratin potatoes. I asked for my steak to be medium-well, and it came out looking charred to a crisp. The server even said \"rib-eye well...errrrr...medium-well\" as he presented the plate to me. I immediately cut into the steak to see that the inside was slightly red on the inside, and it was just the outside that was extra crispy. Most of the steak tasted OK, but there were parts where it was so over cooked that it reminded me of eating a burnt marshmallow. It had that texture of being burnt to a bubbling state. I ate as much of the steak as I could, and tried to avoid as much of the burnt areas as possible. The gratin potatoes were good, but nothing special. They came out hot, and the serving size was pretty good. About a hour after I finished eating at Craftsteak, I had a terrible stomach ache. Granted, I had been in Vegas for a couple of days and my stomach was churning a bit from all of the buffets and drinks...but this was a different type of pain. It felt like I had a 16 pound bowling ball dropped on my stomach, and the feeling was with me ALL night. I will not be eating here again.

I'm not a big goat cheese fan, but the way they prepared this dish was excellent. Both meats obviously are not of the creme de la creme wagyu quality, but served its purpose in providing very tasty and flavorful protein. The sides of the squash and mushroom were good, but they were cut in such tiny cubes that it was a bit tough to scoop out in spoonfuls.The top everything off with a decadent dessert like the monkey bread is just absolutely ridiculous.

As good as it gets!\" I can honestly say that the Domestic Wagyu Skirt Steak I had at Craftsteak really was the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. Were it not such an upscale, classy establishment, I would have shouted the \"Woohoo!\" part right there on the spot. I wanted to take my girlfriend to one really nice dinner while we were in Vegas together, something really memorable. Based on good reviews, my penchant for a nice steak, and a strong recommendation from my friend Randi B., Craftsteak got the nod. I made a reservation for Friday at 8:00 PM, but we ended up hungry and ready an hour early. The nice people at Craftsteak go us a table at 7:05 in their gorgeous dining room. We started out with a Caesar Salad and Lobster Bisque. The salad was excellent, but the bisque was absolutely outstanding. Big, meaty chunks of lobster in the bottom of the bowl right where you can see them before the server pours the smooth, succulent bisque on top. Perfect presentation, top notch ingredients, and amazing flavor. I love bisque and this stuff was amazing. Then on to the steak. The flavor was so complex that on the first bite, I missed the point. I didn't get the subtlety of just how great this steak was. I tried a bite of my girlfriend's Filet Mignon, and I initially thought that she made the better choice. But when I got back to my skirt steak, the perfect marbling, the amazing seasoning, and the way the steak held its flavor became apparent. The filet was amazing too, and slightly more tender then the skirt steak, but flavor of the skirt trumped it. Randi recommended this steak to me specifically, and I in turn recommend it to you. For the starch, we had potatoes au gratin. Again, wonderful. But the real star of the \"side\" lines was the Brentwood Sweet Corn. My girlfriend took the first bite of this, and let out a small sigh of pleasure, and said \"Oh, you have to try this.\" It really was amazing. In fact, the best corn I have ever eaten now that I think about it. I don't know what it was, it seemed to just be grilled corn on the cob, cut off, and dipped in some light butter sauce, but my god. We were calling it \"Crack Corn,\" because it was like crack. Again, I highly recommend it. Dinner also comes with free freshly baked dinner rolls here. We had two orders, the second without the salt on top. The bread was amazing, and better without the salt. After all that, we were too full for desert, which is a bit of a shame, because I'll bet it would have been transcendent. But, as I always say in Vegas, you have to know when to hold them, and when to fold them. Niether of us drink, so we had nothing but water in the liquid department. After the soup, salad, two steaks, potatoes, and corn, the total was $200.43.

Being the hard ass that he is on the show, your food better be darn good to place your name on a restaurant. Craftsteak lived up to ALL my expectations and that shouldn't be taken lightly (I'm a very critical person that's very hard to please...)On 12/6, being that it was the night of the De La Hoya and Pacquiao fight, it was PACKED. Luckily, we had reservations for 5:30 PM and were seated promptly. I loved the super swanky d\u00e9cor --high ceilings with hanging lights, and huge decantors lined up on one side of the room which gave the room a dramatic effect. Not sure if because it was the week of the National Rodeo event, but they were playing country music which did not jive with the d\u00e9cor and was very off-putting. On to the food...My bf and I both ordered the Domestic Waygu 3-Course Tasting Menu ($130/person). Before our 1st course, we were given bread which tasted and resembled Pan De Sal. It was nicely toasted on the outside. Upon tearing it in half, the inside was light and fluffy. \u00a0First Courses:*Diver Scallops: Very good, it was nicely crusted and tender. The creamy white sauce with a hint of rosemary was a perfect compliment. *Kobe Tartare: \u00a0Very good, the quail (?) egg yolk added an extra later of richness to the already buttery texture of the tartare. That combined with the warm, crispy crostini was a good combination of textures.*Caesar Salad: Excellent, the best Caesar I've ever tasted. The dressing had the perfect amount of seasoning and kick. It had an intense depth of flavor to it without being too salty.*Roasted Red Peppers: Eh, I'm not a fan of bell peppers in general, so I didn't care too much for this.Main Courses:*Kobe Skirt Steak: OMFG--MIND BLOWING!!!! Words can't describe how AMAZING this tasted. I'm not a fan of skirt steak; I normally go for the Filet Mignon or NY Strip. But, after tasting this cut, it has changed my mind forever about this cut. It was cooked PERFECTLY; it was nicely charred and cooked to an exact medium rare. It was served on a caste iron plate surrounded by its juices. It was nice and crisp on the outside and SUPER TENDER and moist in the inside. It had SO MUCH FLAVOR (w/o being overly salty)--it was like an INTENSE EXPLOSION in my mouth. The first time I had Kobe was from Lark Creek Steak where I was quite disappointed. But, Craftsteak's Kobe tasted nothing like this. No doubt about it, the ABSOLUTE BEST STEAK EVER!!!! If I had one last meal on Earth, this would be it!*Kobe Strip: It was just ok...it wasn't tender and didn't have much flavor--disappointing. *Sides:-Mashed Potatoes: The BEST mashed potatoes I've ever tasted. It was whipped perfectly. It was super creamy and buttery; just way mashed potatoes is suppose to be. Again, it was very flavorful without being too salty (I'm very sensitive to salt).-Asparagus: It was nice and tender. It was topped off with crispy lemon zests which gave the dish a great texture combination.-Shitake and Chanterelle Mushrooms: Eh, could have passed on this one.Third Course:*Molten Chocolate Lava Cake Crusted with Macadamia Nut and Espresso Ice Cream: Very good; at this point, I was stuffed and spilling out of my dress, so I was only able to enjoy one bite. Upon cutting the cake, which was nice, and crisp, rich decadent chocolate oozes out. That paired with the rich ice cream led to a great combination of flavors, heat (hot/cold), and textures. \u00a0*Spiced Apple Cake with Maple Ice Cream: OMG GOOD! The cake was crisp outside and moist and light inside. It paired perfectly with the maple ice cream. Again, great texture and flavors. The ice cream had pieces of maple candy in it which took it to another level.*Pineapple and Grapefruit Sorbet with Fresh Fruit: I ate most of this dessert, as it was light and refreshing. It was a great ending to the meal. Service was impeccable and not pretentious. BTW, the portions are MASSIVE. The two 3 course menus we ordered could have easily fed 4 people. I liked the fact that they mixed up our menu since we both got the same tasting menu. This way we didn't end up with two of everything. If it weren't for the Kobe Strip which was disappointing, Craftsteak would have gotten 5 stars in my book.The bill came to about $400 including 2 glasses of wine which was definitely worth it for the quantity and quality of food you receive.

So, the first thing we did when arriving at Vegas was make reservations.I'll mention a few things: My wife and I are both under 30 and we were a party of two. I've always felt that if you really want to know how good a restaurant truly is, you visit as a party of two. Any restaurant in the world will bend over backwards to make a big party happy (servers know that more people = bigger tips), but when a restaurant treats a couple well, you know that they have class. Sad to say, this was the most classless fine dining experience that we've ever had. We would have complained to the manager had they been anywhere to be found... alas, Yelp.com gets the supreme pleasure of hearing the brutal truth :) Have fun with this guys/gals!First: for $110 a person, you can eat like a king in Vegas. The food here was edible, but so is the food at any $30 buffet in town. You come to a place like this for top notch service and mind-blowing food - Craftsteak failed at both.Service: 1/5As many yelpers have suggested, the service here is almost non-existent until you are filling out the tip line on the check, when it becomes patronizing. We waited nearly 20 minutes before one of our four servers even bothered to ask us if we wanted to get drinks - and another 20 minutes before they asked if we wanted to order. With four servers you'd think that a party of two would be able to place a drink and food order within a half hour.Now, before you think that this was intentional politeness on their part (nobody likes to be urged to order right away at a nice restaurant), this wasn't that - this was them being nearly oblivious to the fact that we were in the restaurant in the first place; Which is odd, because we made reservations and were seated front and center in the middle of the dining room. Still optimistic, we asked for an explanation about how the restaurant preferred to serve it's guests - but instead of being offered a clear explanation of the menu, the waiter rambled off a nearly incoherent sentence or two about how we should really just order from the chef's tasting menu. Ok, thanks for nothing - we are at Craftsteak, we KNOW that we're here for the chef's tasting menu! We came to spend!20 more minutes passed before the next of our waiters arrived. He, again, advised us on the chef's tasting menu. We urged him to explain the tasting menu and finally we got an explanation - which would have been great except that he got his numbers completely mixed up. He explained that each guest receives 2 salad tastings, 2 meat tastings, and 2 side tastings. Our math said that meant 6 different tastings per person - 12 total - another Yelper mentioned 16 plates of food per couple, so that sounded about right. We waited another 15 before anyone came back to take our order...The third waiter shows up like the friggin' hero of the day. We proceed to place our order, he informs us that we have everything wrong - you only get 1 of each tasting selection... which is kinda funny - because it defeats the purpose of the \"tasting\" menu if you are just going to serve massive family size portions of a few things, but whatever. We ordered the tasting menus (the wagyu beef versions, which were $130/person).About 30 seconds pass before we did a little math and realized that we were actually paying quite a bit MORE for the tasting menu than if we had just ordered ala carte for the items that we wanted to try thanks to our fellow Yelpers (Bisque, Quail, Yukon Puree, Filet, etc.).Throughout the meal, servers rarely came to the table to check on us. Service was tacky, although they were so pretentious that someone might confuse it for them being \"fancy\". Cmon yelpers - it's not \"fancy\" to leave cold, uneaten bread on the table for the ENTIRE meal when you have the main course out. It's not \"fancy\" to leave the clean, empty wine glasses on the table when we are on our second round of cocktails. Fine dining establishments are careful to manicure the eating process, this felt like I was at TGIF Fridays. Servers bumbled around, breaking 2 wine glasses and hoping no one saw. We had dirty, finished plates of food in front of us for the majority of the meal. My drink sat empty for no less than 25 minutes. I could go on but Yelp limits me to 5000 letters ;) Food - 2/5:The Ribeye was tasty, but thin and covered in fat and gristle. The Filet was overcooked. The lobster bisque tasted like it was doused in fennel seeds. The quail, onions and yukons were good. The rest was mediocre at best. Again - it was edible, but for $110+ per person, my jaw should be in my lap. Worse, no ever checked on us despite $270 of food being on the table.

The cash, because even though the menu is extensive (items range from about $12 to $130, with most meats being $50 and up), you owe it to yourself to try the 3 course Kobe Tasting Menu at minumum. At $130 per person, it isn't cheap, but when you're done you'll realize that it was money well spent. The appetite, because assuming you've ordered the above, you will be rewarded with the most insanely good, heavenly Kobe steaks on earth along with impressive sides and desserts. Our party of four decided to go big (I don't believe in coming to these caliber restaurants and ordering small) and we were rewarded with Kobe filet mignon, Kobe ribeye, Kobe skirt steak, and Kobe sirloin. Being a chefs' tasting menu, we did not get to decide what starters/sides/cuts/desserts to order, but this made the experience that much more exciting. The entire meal was served family style, giving everyone an opportunity to try everything. The wine list was equally impressive, actually it was more like a book than a list. Apparently there were over 700 wines in it, with some bottles topping over $8000 (we did NOT go this big).Each cut of meat was presented in either a cast iron or stainless steel pan, complete with the most amazing steak sauce reductions. The filet, ribeye, and skirt steak easily could have been the best three cuts of steak I've ever had. The Kobe sirloin seemed pedestrian in comparison, but was easily up there with most cuts at any other top steakhouse. The starters and sides were also very good with the highlights being the Kobe beef tartare and the potato puree. The four desserts were also excellent but probably weren't enjoyed as much because all of us were in a Kobe-beef induced haze.The service, decor and ambiance was excellent as expected, my only complaint being that the restaurant is super dim.

It was an awesome value for the amount of food included. My husband and I shared 4 apps.: 2 salad like things, the Hawaiian prawns (sweet and buttery) and a charcuterie platter. For the sides, we were given mashed potatoes (kinda runny and pasty), sauteed mushrooms and grilled asparagus. And for the meat, oh baby the meat...Kobe fillet and sirloin, cooked and seasoned perfectly. It was truly one of the most succulent meals we've had in a long time. Yeah, sure the sides and salads could be considered forgettable and how can a meat and potatoes place actually mess up mashed potatoes? But really, compared to how the food scene was in Vegas 10 years ago, this place could be considered fantastic. But I did say, \"could.\" So here's my beef (ha-ha, get it?), the dessert. I'll remember this because it just seemed so off. We got monkey bread with caramel sauce (the bread was not golden enough, in fact it looked kinda anemic in the darkly lit dining room), molten chocolate cake (ho-hum, I might as well have gotten a vanilla creme brulee), sorbet and gelato quartet ( no fireworks here) and a sliced Asian pear (that's right, sliced, not even nicely sliced, with the seeds still in it. And no, it wasn't even poached). Something definitely fell short in the kitchen.My other beef is the service, my biggest pet peeve. So this is how it usually goes, servers welcome you in, give you a menu, talk you up and completely sell you on the experience that you are about to have. They get you your order, get your drinks, even go next door to another restaurant to get you a bottle of sake because they don't carry any and once they drop the entrees, the main event, it's like a black hole suddenly appears in the middle of the dining room. Where did the server go? Is that him, oops my bad, that was just an illusion. It kinda looks like him but he keeps disappearing and acting so uninterested in you that it can't be him. My advice to servers is this, follow through with your diners man. You could have made up for the bad dessert experience if you even bothered to check if we wanted coffee! So, sad to say, it was a good and bad experience, I would have loved to give this place 4 stars because the beef was just so amazing. This place definitely suffered from bad service.

Weren't quite sure what to order so we went with the domestic wagyu surf & turf which came with lobster bisque, 3 choices of salad, new york strip, ribeye, 3 choices of sidedishes and dessert all for about $160 per person. Lobster bisque: Took a sip and was transported to heaaavvveeennn!!! The bisque was just so creamy and smooth with little bits of lobster meat in it and I also think a slight hint of curry? Who knows. Who cares. It was freakin delicious. Salad: Caesar, market spinach, wild arugula. Caesar is your typical caesar with anchovy.. interesting but tasty. The market spinach would have to have been my favorite. I thought the port wine really complemented the spinach, apples, and walnuts. The wild arugula was alright I guess.. nothing special. New York Strip & Ribeye: Honestly a baby could have eaten this. Why? Because its melt-in-your-mouth steak. First bite and you probably only chew 2-3 times. Yes. It is that good. Between the two I would have to favor the new york strip just because it was probably less chewy. Both were done in a medium rare.Sides: Baby spinach, Mushroom assortment, potato puree. yum yum triple yum! All three of the side dishes were pretty much done perfectly. And I'm sure all their other sides are done just as well so I guess pick whichever you like. You won't be disappointed!Dessert: Cinnamon monkey bread, fruit platter, espresso chocolate & raspberry sorbet?? Forgot. Anyways, I'm not a big fan of cinnamon but the monkey bread only had a hint of cinnamon so still quite tasty. I heard thats their number 1 dessert.

We had a reservation for Saturday at 10pm. Tip #1: Don't make a reservation for 10pm in Vegas. I started the drinking day at 8am with a bloody mary, so by the time our dinner started I was beginning my 14th consecutive hour of drinking.I have the receipt next to me, so I'm just going to walk through it item by item:2 Miller Lite - $12: I swear to God I had no memory of us ordering two Miller Lites until I read it on the receipt just now. Clearly, despite the incredibly high quality of this restaurant, their Miller Lites are less than memorable.6 oyster, daily - $24: I am responsible for ordering this completely unnecessary appetizer. None of us are even all that crazy about oysters, though I did enjoy them.1 Glass Pinot Noir - $17: One of my friends got this. I didn't try any of this $17 wine, but I'm guessing it wasn't as good as three Miller Lites or four oysters.1 Arugula - $13: This salad was ordered by the same dude who ordered the wine. At this point in the meal, he's easily our table's frontrunner for \"most proper diner\" with wine and salad. I'm in second with a Miller Lite and oysters, while my other friend is nursing a Miller Lite and looking as though he is about to hurl.Bread - $0: This is not on the receipt, but it is worth mentioning. We tore into this bread like Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman eating that weird melon in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (Wait, what? You don't get this reference?). This bread was so damn good. Granted, we had been drinking for over half a day and intentionally starving ourselves since \"we are going to Craftsteak later!! wooo!!\" Our bread destruction is how I know the service was top notch. We tore through the bread in--I shit you not--30 seconds per plate, and got through four plates of it. Yet, each time, our server had a new plate of fresh bread waiting for us almost instantly.2 Potato Gratin - $28: This was poorly played by us. When two of you are going to drop $14 on simple potato sides, you should probably diversify. At least the portion was very large, and the potatoes did taste good. They actually tasted sort of like Betty Crocker Three Cheese Potatoes except, well, no that's exactly what they tasted like. Only they were $14. C'mon though, you can't just eat a steak on a plate all by itself right? Wrong. You most definitely can. Lay out $14 on the plate next to the steak, and while you are eating decide whether you'd like to exchange that for some Betty Crocker potatoes.1 Ribeye: $511 NY Strip: $481 Steak & Lobster: $69 - The steaks really were great. I got the strip, and it was cooked perfectly. Some reviewers were disappointed with theirs, and perhaps it being near 11pm and less crowded allowed for closer attention to be paid to our steaks, but my steak truly was perfect. The filet was good too. I know this because my friend went to the bathroom while there was still some filet left on his plate, so I just picked it up and popped that badboy right into my mouth. Yeah, it was kind of a dick move and, yes, I understand that alcohol shouldn't be an excuse for bad behavior, but I had at this point been drinking for FIFTEEN HOURS.OVERALL: Great experience, great food, and the total bill ($283.22) wasn't even that bad, though this had a lot to do with how little we were drinking since we were already on the verge of dying.", "Date": "2012-02-26", "Author_Location": "Seattle, WA"}, {"Author": "Maria C.", "ReviewID": "g7wgiPmrR70NUw3WQA8wvw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks to Yelp, I had one of the best dining experiences at Craftsteak.

Been a while. Nice to get reacquainted.So let me set this up. I visited the CraftSteak in NYC a few years ago for lunch, but that was for the burger, and while it was very good, I didn't go rushing back partly because there are so/too many options in NYC, plus it closed to make way for Collichio & Sons (high on the list).Flash forward to Vegas. Even though it's the buffet mecca, celebrity chef restaurants top the list for me out there. So when my buddy Big J, who's a regular here, invited me to join him and Adam the Pimp, I instantly said hell yeah what time. The place was not full when we arrived at 6pm, but it had totally filled by 8pm when we left, following a quick tour of the kitchen and meeting the head chef (Matt Seeber, not Colicchio, btw). In those two hours, I had one of my Top 10 dining out experiences.Craftsteak produced by far the best damn lobster bisque and steak I've had. The bisque had several plump lobster chunks, not those little bits you often get, and the flavor was exceptional. I don't get excited about soup. This was special. But the real star was the 12 oz. Wagyu Skirt Steak. Served medium rare, by the first bite, I rediscovered that special happy place that a great steak transports me to, but something was different this time. As I kept eating, I realized I'd not had a steak that delicious before. I even closed my eyes a few times to shut out one of the key senses and focus more intensively on the taste. Pimpski, who also ordered the skirt steak, concurred that this was like a steak apex. Big J was going to town on the surf and turf, but had recommended the skirt, so it we'll call it unanimous (along with many other reviewers). The sides were also fantastic. Loved the Yukon gold puree potatoes and asparagus, but we all agreed that the braised Brussels sprouts with smoked bacon was the standout. \u00a0 Dessert didn't miss a beat, either. The monkey bread gets a lot of love, but I tried a new bread pudding that wasn't on the menu yet, and like the lobster bisque, it stood apart from every other version I've had of this classic. It was much lighter than most, and was the perfect ending to the meal.That the service was uniformly excellent throughout didn't seem to have anything to do with my friend being a regular. Looking around at surrounding tables and booths, the servers were constantly moving, bringing dishes at the right time, refilling water and drinks, and asking how things were, just as they were with our table. Combined with the overall ambiance, the service created a very welcoming and comfortable atmosphere. Others have touched on the prices, which are also on the menu, so you should already know what you're in for there, but I'll add this: It's not just the dollar amount, but the total value of the meal and the overall experience.

However, the foie gras was delicious. \u00a0The sweet candied kumquat accompanying the savory sauce created a perfect harmony with the foie gras. \u00a0We really enjoyed it.Then...we waited for twenty minutes between our starters and main dish which really was a bit longer than we'd liked!Entrees:I ordered the American Kobe filet mignon which was a HUGE disappointment. \u00a0I had requested for medium rare but the steak was cooked a bit more medium than I had liked. \u00a0Not to mention, the heavy handed seasoning defiled the filet. \u00a0The \"hint\" of blue cheese seared into the steak overpowered the tender cut and detracted from the meat.He ordered the \"regular\" rib eye which was half the price of my American Kobe and it was DELICIOUS! \u00a0I don't ever regret ordering anything but boy did I absolutely wish I had ordered the rib eye too! \u00a0It was the one redeeming part of the meal thus far.Side dishes:The Jerusalem artichokes were absolutely delicious (lots of fiber too!) It was cubed and reminded me of \"country fries\". \u00a0It was well seasoned and absolutely not oily at all. \u00a0It had great texture and the flavor was satisfying. \u00a0The Tuscan kale and smoked bacon, on the other hand, was way too salty. \u00a0We had to say something about it, and the waiter indicated that this is the response they often get when this dish is on the menu. \u00a0They took it off our bill and brought \u00a0us a different sauteed vegetable. \u00a0They explained that the smoke bacon adds the salt to the dish but as the kale sits and the sauce reduces, the overall dish becomes saltier. \u00a0YIKES, disappointing.Dessert:I ordered the panna cotta which was an extremely sophisticated, or as my honey puts it, \"adult\" dessert. \u00a0The panna cotta is infused with jasmine. Think of the panna cotta as a delivery mechanism for the jasmine flavor. The texture adds interest. \u00a0When tasted by itself the scent of jasmine is very strong which I enjoyed but he thought was too strong. \u00a0The panna cotta sits on a macaroon and when eaten together, it is a perfect contrast of chewy and creamy (not milky tho) and the floral scent adds to the overall experience. \u00a0The serving plate is drizzled with honey and thinly sliced asian pears accompanies the dessert. \u00a0There was a lot of components and maybe even a bit too much going on, but I liked it. \u00a0He had ice cream which he called \"kiddy dessert\" - simple but excellent.Excluding alcohol, our bill was $270, which in absolute terms isn't expensive per se, but in terms of the value we were expecting, it wasn't really worth it! \u00a0At over $110, the American Kobe filet was a BIG disappointment.At $24, the foie gras, although tasty, was a really small portion for the price. \u00a0The kale was just overall salty and blah. \u00a0I really wanted to like this place more.", "Date": "2009-02-17", "Author_Location": "Newport Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Lacey M.", "ReviewID": "o1gDTLr9cLY-H5P4WlEWJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wish that I could give this place more then 5 stars... and I don't believe I've ever thought that way about a restaurant before. \u00a0It made me actually think about other places I gave 5 stars to, in order to down-grade them. \u00a0Everything here was absolutely amazing: service, food, wine, ambiance, and value.This was another one of those restaurants that I had very high expectations for. \u00a0I mean, Tom Colicchio is like a God to me. \u00a0I'm a huge Top Chef fan... since the very first season... so this was a must-visit restaurant for me on my trip to Vegas. \u00a0Not only did he meet my high expectations, but they were completely blown out of the water.Our server was so great... she was very knowledgeable about the food and wine, and was great about keeping our waters and bread plate full. \u00a0Towards the end of the meal, when we realized how late we were running, she brought our check with the desserts and was so prompt that we were able to make our VIP table reservation at Studio 54.I absolutely loved the ambiance here. \u00a0Very manly... dark wood and leather. \u00a0So gorgeous and classy, but also laid back and easy. \u00a0I thought the fact that the bread and steaks were served on cast-iron skillets, fit in perfectly. \u00a0And the bread was amazing: white dinner rolls with a salted crust on top.Now to the food... oh, the food. \u00a0I saw something about a summer tasting menu online beforehand, so I asked the waitress about it. \u00a0She said that they only do that during the week... but moments later she returned and said that it would be fine. \u00a0My girlfriends and I decided that at $60/person, it was a great idea. \u00a0One of my friends and I added the wine pairing for around $15, which was amazing... the 3 glasses of wine went perfectly with each course.For our first course we had: \u00a0Shaved Fennel SaladGrilled Quail, VincottoBuffalo Mozzarella with Red Pepper CaponataPersian Cucumber SaladNow this was my first time tasting fennel and quail, and it was a great one!

The prix fixe menu was around $50-60 per person and pre-Top Chef fame. The reason why we loved it was the quality, the variety and the reasonable cost. Since then, they've steadily raised the prices to around $80/person which is way overpriced (plus they changed the beef to black angus... it used to be kobe.)So we returned for Restaurant Week for it's more reasonable price point at $50.10/person. We had 5 people at our table and we were quite pleased by the spread.Service was quite prompt, warm and efficient. Our server was pleased that we had come in for the Restaurant week event and was eager to help us use our vouchers for free drinks. The manager did stop by to greet us and ensure we were having a good time.We were served the grilled quail, shaved fennel salad, persian cucumber/watercress salad, mozzarella salad for appetizers. This was followed by prime flat iron steak, grilled angus skirtsteak, sweet corn, yukon potatoes, scallops with the lemon vinaigrette and a dish of baby shitake mushrooms. (for more details, please see the above pics).The grilled quail was tender, perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious. As were all three of the starter salads. We actually received two dishes of the mozzarella salad although we would have preferred more of the fennel salad. Along with the piping hot butter pan rolls, all the flavours of the food worked together beautifully.The two beef dishes were well-executed and I loved the springs of fresh thyme. The scallops had a wonderful caramelization on both sides.The corn was fabulous as always and we were given two dishes of this. Although I really like the flavours of their Yukon Gold potatoe puree, I do like my potatoes to be a little less soft (albeit it's a puree... right? but still a little texture would be better). The shitake mushrooms were a very small serving size considering that this dish was to be shared amongst 5 of us. Same goes for the potato puree.We had two rather large servings of skirtsteak and flat iron prime with relatively smaller portions of sides. I think I would have like more sides rather than so much beef.Dessert consisted of five separate dishes: a peach pavlova, a chocolate panna cotta, a molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, monkey bread with banana ice cream and a traditional cheesecake.Of the 5 desserts, the monkey bread and the molten chocolate cake were my favourite. The warm monkey bread had a rich cinnamon, nut topping and was perfectly paired with banana gelato. The molten chocolate cake was moist on the outside, runny on the inside - just the way it's supposed to be.The chocolate panna cotta was a little too firm texturally. While I did like the peach sorbet on top of the pavlova, the pavlova itself was a little too thick and thus felt very hard overall. The cheesecake was good but nothing special.In essence, this is simple food is done right. The only problems were the proportions of the side dishes and some issues with the desserts. This results in a 4 star review.I have to say, for $50, it's a good deal but certainly not $80ish as it normally is. Because we did the Wet Republic event, we got 30.10/person voucher plus a coupon for a free drink each. So overall, we paid $30ish per person (including tax and tip).

I'm normally not a beets person but I LOVED THIS!!! ENTREE: My mom and I got the 24-HOUR BRAISED SHORT RIBS. OHHHH MYYYY GODDDD. These babies melted in my mouth. Literally. SOOOOO TENDER. And they give you a HUGE slab. HUGE!!!!! Yes, Craftsteak is pricey, but unlike other \"fine dining\" eateries I've been to, their portions actually made me FULL and this was worth EVERY PENNY. My sister got the kurobota porkchop, which was quite delicious too, but I suggest sticking to their forte- their beef entrees. My dad got the filet mignon which, I quote unquote, was \"the best filet I've ever had.\" Wow and my dad has had a lot of filets in his lifetime. THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING. SIDES: Yukon Gold Potato Puree with Chives- IDK how much butter they use in this thing, maybe I don't wanna know but it was incredibly NOM. It's puree, so it's not chunky like mashed potatoes. It's smooth and buttery and just compliments the meat!!! Spinach- super fresh spinach roasted with olive oil... pretty simple but I love spinach and this was DELICIOUS.DESSERT: I was wayyyyyy too stuffed to order my own dessert but my sister got a combo of SPICED APPLE CIDER SORBET + CHAI CHOCOLATE CHIP GELATO. Yes, the gelato/sorbets are $6 for 2 scoops which is pretty good considering most places only give you one scoop for the same price.

I read a ton of Yelps about where to get the best steak in Vegas, and I'm pretty sure I made the right choice.I am a fan of grass-fed, so I started my research looking for a steakhouse that offered grass-fed beef. I was surprised how few there were. This website is super-helpful for discerning the different types of steak offered in vegas: vegasmadeeasy.com/dining\u2026. I had no idea there were so many choices.At any rate, I narrowed my choices down to those that serve wagyu, and Craftsteak supposedly does it best. It's hard to say this was the best steak I've ever had because comparing regular beef steaks to a wagyu steak is like comparing apples and oranges.The menu has traditional beef steaks, domestic wagyu, and austrailian wagyu. I understand that from time to time, they do have grass-fed on the menu. I ordered the domestic wagyu skirt steak ($69) and my husband ordered a traditional strip steak ($55). We wanted to be able to compare the two. Both portion sizes were generous. Mine was 14 oz. and I think the hubs' was 16 oz. \u00a0Skirt steak is generally a very lean cut, and I don't think I've ever seen it offered as a \"steak\" entree, but wagyu is different. Unlike regular steak, the fat of wagyu is tiny flecks marbled throughout the cut, which allows leaner cuts that are generally cooked other ways to work as a grilled steak entree when it's waygu.The wagyu steak comes already cut into strips, which I thought was odd. But it didn't seem to negatively affect the juiciness of the meat. Both of us ordered ours medium rare. The were perfectly cooked. Because i was curious, I asked the waiter how they can make them well done, or even medium well, given the composition of the fat in the meat, and he said they do infact make them that way when someone orders them, and because it is a thin cut of meat, it only takes a few minutes to get it to medium well and the fat doesn't have time to render out much.The wagyu steak was so tender that you could lay you knife on it sharp side down, and the weight of the knife would cut the steak. It was uniformly juicy, almost bordering on greasy, but certainly not in a bad way. It was hard to describe, but unbelievably delicious.There was a cheaper offering on the domestic wagyu menu, I think around $61, and two more expensive ones, I think the NY Strip was around $100 and the filet around $115. The Austrialian wagyu was well over $100 for the cheapest cut.Craftsteak offers complimentary bread, which is good, but don't waste your stomach space on it. We split a side dish of the grilled corn, and it was amazing; better than you'd expect. We also go the wagyu tartare appetizer. It was fantastic, but again, I didn't have anything to compare it to, since I've never had wagyu beef or steak tartare before. It came with a quail egg on top and was served with toasted crostini.Our bill was just south of $200. We had an appetizer, a shared side dish, two steaks, and my husband had two beers and I had a glass of wine. Our meal was well worth the cost, and I'd go there again in a heart beat.

While I have been somewhat critical of the food, overall, we definitely enjoyed our meal here. \u00a0However, for this restauranteur's celebrity status and the matching prices, I honestly expected better from him. \u00a0That being said, I would certainly return to this place. \u00a0I just can't give this a 5-star rating.", "Date": "2012-01-08", "Author_Location": "Simi Valley, CA"}, {"Author": "Jason W.", "ReviewID": "M3nSLwJg9R_YpTjQWRRqYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a god, and shim resides in the culinary wonders that come out of the kitchen of Craftsteak.

Of course when it came time for dessert no one had any interest in eating anymore. Peter Luger's in NYC has long held my top-spot for steakhouses, and it'll continue to do so, but just because it's so iconic and traditional.

I ordered the braised short ribs and hubby ordered the Kobe Waygu skirt steak with a side of hen of the woods mushrooms. The lobster bisque is the best I ever tasted. It has chunks of lobster in it which is rare since I have tried others. The short ribs were tender, succulent, filled with robust flavors and melted in my mouth. I tried some of the Kobe waygu which was cooked to a medium perfection. If you never tried this type of beef, it is definitely worth the money. It is just different in a VERY good way.

It has a great earthy taste with a great texture that is hard to describe. We also tried their Chocolate souffle and oh my, oh my....it was warm, chocolaty and satisfying. Dinner was so good, we didn't want to end it so quickly so along with the souffle, we ordered the banana brown sugar ice cream. Eating here was just a blast and I can't wait to go back.

They come in a batch of six, and by the time we had finished 4, another set had come. Great service.Apps - We had the Seafood Platter and Kobe Beef Tartare. The seafood platter was delicious, comprised of oysters, clams, prawn, lobster, seaweed salad, alaskan king crab, and caviar. One person in the party said the only problem with this platter \"was that it wasn't bigger.\" This seafood app blows Mastro's out of the water (seafood lives in water....). The beef tartare was equally amazing, which was raw kobe beef with a raw egg on top, served with miniature bread pieces. The tartare prepared us well for the main course ahead.The Main Course - 16oz. Grilled RIbeye steak, charred rare. The steak was perfectly marbled, with a high fat content, which ribeyes should have. Cooked perfectly. I also got to sample my friends' grilled NY Strip and Wagyu Ribeye. All were delectable, and was able to distinguish the varying textures of the cuts.Sides - Bean Sprouts, Hen of the Woods Mushrooms, and Yukon Gold Puree. Bean Sprouts were interesting in a good way. Paired with bacon, the sprouts were well prepared with a great texture. The Hen of the Woods (I'm told this is a Colicchio signature dish) were interesting as well. It didn't blow everything out of the water, but it was very good, with a good texture. I love mushrooms, and this was like nothing I've ever had before. The Yukon Gold Puree was a very buttery bowl of mashed potatoes, prepared thinner than regular mashed potatoes. It was awesome.Didn't get to dessert because 1) I don't like dessert (I'd rather have more steak) and 2) was very full.Went for halloween weekend, but the candy wasn't just for trick or treaters.

The waiter arrived with a huge dessert plate with 4 different items - \u00a01) Monkey bread (like a cinnamon bun) , carrot cake, cheese cake and and an ice cream selection.I have a big appetite, well above average but this was just to much food for a single sitting. Next time I will skip the tasting menu and likely save some money as well. Overall... Craftsteak has excellent food and service but very pricey.

It was a Thursday night, no reservations, and we were seated right away. The area we were seated was a rather bit odd. I think we were actually seated in the bar's lounge area. I didn't really mind but it definitely was not the general dining area.Anyway, straight to business - my SO and I started with the charcuterie platter ($24). It came with a snazzy dish of different mustards which I didn't really care for. The charcuterie platter came with your typical salumi, soppressata (sp?), headcheese, etc. It was nothing to write home about; although the soft pretzels that accompanied it was very nice. For our main, we both had the dry-aged NY strip steak ($48) with cauliflower ($9) and French fries ($13). The steaks were cooked the way we requested and the side dishes were generous portions. For dessert, I decided to be adventurous and order the maple bacon ice cream. It was kind of icky. If someone had told me it was butter pecan, I would've thought it was a very \"buttery\" butter pecan flavor. However, I knew it was bacon AND there were bacon bits in it so I couldn't really wrap my head around it.All in all, a good experience but definitely came with a hefty price tag (wine included).

Of course the dim lighting may have hidden any imperfections in presentation, but I'm giving Tom the benefit of the doubt. I shared with my date the Flat Iron American Kobe and the Duck Confit.

When deciding on restaurants to eat at in Vegas, Craftsteak was a given. Located in the restaurant corner of the MGM Grand (it was a little hard to find so allot some time to find it when you get there), Craftsteak at first looks like a quaint little coffee shop next to some bigger gaudier dining facilities. Don't be fooled though! Once you walk past the bar, it opens up into a fine dining area that you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.I had read some of the reviews here and searched for menus online to figure out what I was prepared to eat (and pay for!). There are 2 things you can do with the menu. You can either order the individual dishes that you want (mostly for those who have been there before and know what they want) or you can go with the chef's menu. Understand that when you come here, you are prepared to eat meat. If you're vegetarian, you'll find dishes, but you won't get quite the experience that your fellow carnivores will get. Given that this was my first time here, I went with the Chef's menu which is for parties of 2 or more. On the Chef's menu, there are several choices and the increasing prices correlates with the grade of beef and whether you want lobster with that. I went with the domestic wagyu surf and turf which I think was $155 per person with a minimum of 2 people.Don't worry if you don't like or can't eat certain types of foods when ordering the chef's menu. Tell the waiter! The chef's menu is anything but set and changes with the people who order and the waiter who serves you! My fiance doesn't like mushrooms so that was scratched off the menu and replaced by spinach and some potatoes that were mashed to the point that they were just golden liquid yellow goodness.We started off with 4 appetizer dishes which included the following: prosciutto with a pear chutney , seared shrimp cocktail, fresh mozzarella, and a fresh caesar salad topped with fresh anchovies. I have to be honest, they were all very nicely prepared, very delicious, but if you're here to get \"mind blowing\" flavors and flavor combinations, this might disappoint you. However, I can't stress enough that they use the freshest of ingredients. I don't normally like anchovies, but these were delicious!I had ordered a lobster bisque to taste since so many people recommended it, but I think the waiter forgot about that. Luckily he did because I was about to explode afterwards. TOO MUCH FOOD! LOLThen we got served the main course: the skirt steak, riblet and lobster. I actually didn't think the lobster was all that stunning. It was good, but nothing special! The skirt steak and riblet, on the other hand, were simply delicious. They were so savory and literally melts in your mouth. The sauce is quite stunning and perfectly complements the expensive beef.But wait! It's not over until after dessert! They gave us 4 desserts: spiced pineapple (eh), 2 types of sorbets (pleasant), chocolate lava cake (mm) and monkey bread with banana ice cream. Now, for me, the most mind blowing dish of the night was the monkey bread! It's pretty much like a cinnamon roll but the caramelized sugar and perfect amount of flavoring makes it worth coming to Craftsteak to have this pastry. I forgot to mention earlier that their bread is fantastic, but don't fill up! I think we ate all 6 rolls and that doomed us for the rest of the dinner. Service here is great. They are not only attentive (and not annoyingly so), but they are pleasant to speak to and very polite. However, I did feel that we lost some of that attentiveness towards the end of the night. If it were at some other restaurant, I wouldn't be bothered, but since we're tipping these people $80-$100 for the food, you would expect better.Dress code is business casual (button up shirts, no jeans, no ties, no jackets).

This helped the ordering process go along a lot more smoothly.Originally we were just planning to order for ourselves, but our wily veteran felt that it would be better if we ordered the multiple cuts and shared that among us instead. Our server understood and was very accommodating, which eventually led to us getting full stacks of appetizers, desserts, and of course, THE STEAK.I've had Kobe beef in Kobe, Japan, but this was heads and shoulders above my experience there. Every bite melts in your mouth and the juices were so good that I needed more of those delicious rolls to sop up the remaining sauce. Even our friend who usually likes his meat a little more cooked through had to give it up that these medium-rare cuts of marbled beef were sublime. That being said, even though the meat was excellent, the accompanying sides of asparagus, mushrooms, and mashed potatoes were so freaking delicious that you don't mind it taking up space otherwise reserved for the beef.Dessert came out after we were already stuffed, but we made room for the Monkey Bread (aka the Elegant Cinnabon), Ice Cream & Sorbets, Dark Chocolate Tart, Bread Pudding, and fresh fruit.

My table skipped the former, but we got suckered into dessert (mostly because we really wanted it)...and that was a bit of a disappointment. The Chocolate Ganache was too bittersweet (even if that is your preference, as it is mine) and dry, and the Cinnamon Monkey Bread was good, but not enough to stand on its own.Service was well-guided, though they have a tendency to want to clear the plates before you're done - annoying.

A couple of the guys weren't too impressed with the starters and became anxious that the rest of the meal might follow suit. Then came the meat.

Maybe it was just a bad night for the chef- but here are some details of our experience: 1. The service was fine. However, the person who served us didn't fully explain the three course menu (Surf and Turf) to us, so we thought we were getting one appetizer, two types of steak with three sides, two lobster tails, and one dessert. What we got instead was three appetizers, three sides with two steaks, two lobster tails, and three desserts. It was just my husband and I! This could easily have fed about 4-5 people. 2. As a result of #1 above, we paid $500 for a meal that we hardly could finish 25% of. Since we were from out of town, we couldn't save any of it. What a waste. Then again, not sure we would have eaten the leftovers because it was so bland and disappointing.3. For the appetizers, we had beef tartare (we thought this was all we were going to get), grilled Hawaiian prawns, and Caesar salad. The beef tartare was pretty good, same with the shrimp. I thought the salad was lousy though- the anchovies on top were tart instead of being brined. 4. According to all of the reviews, the wagyu rib eye was supposed to be the best steak ever. What a let down! We ordered ours medium rare and it was cooked too much- so I recommend anyone ordering this to order it rare- at least that way you can have them cook it a little more rather than overcook it to start. It was bland and dry. 5. The skirt steak is the cheapest steak on the menu- about $69- and guess what? Way better than the wagyu. We would have been better off ordering just this a la carte. All the steaks that I have ever had at Ruth Chris have been better than this. 6. The sides- everyone is always raving about the sides. The Yukon potatoes were good, not great. The Jerusalem artichokes and the shitake mushrooms were all average. Again, the sides that I have had at Ruth Chris were all way better than any of these. 8. The lobster was average- nothing special about it at all. I have had better from the frozen section at Trader Joe's. 9. The only dessert that my husband ate was the Monkey Bread, and the only one I ate was the chocolate lava cake and the red pear sorbet. We were so full, and not even happy full if you know what I mean. Again, we have both had better at other places. 10. So $500 for way too much food that tasted average? So not worth it. The steaks with lobster were $155 each, and my husband had ordered the wine pairing. Wine was average, the pours were generous, but for average wine you don't really enjoy it that much. I love good food and am not afraid to spend money on it. French Laundry cost us about $600 and was worth every penny. This was not. Nobu cost us about $300 and was way better than this. Daniel Boulud was about $150 and again better than this.

After all, if I'm dropping $100+ on dinner anywhere, it really should be special, and I'd better be welcome.The service staff here is so polite, and professional, and friendly, and attentive.

Anyway, the food (kinda why I've been here three times). This may sound crazy, but the dinner rolls here are consistently the best part of the meal, and that is by no means a let-down. They are warm, pillowy, yeasty rolls with melted butter and sea salt on top. They're crispy like a wafer on top, luxuriously rich in the middle, come out of the pan steaming hot, and with even more whole butter on top, they're the perfect bread course. Side note: The table butter was not cold, and neither was it so warm that I couldn't spread it. Perfect bread with perfect butter. I had the lobster bisque for my appetizer. It was warm, silky, lobster-y goodness, and there's like half a tail's worth of lobster in the bottom. It's a great way to start a steak dinner. This time around I opted for the ribeye. It was a prime ribeye. It weighed 16 oz with a bone before it was cooked. It was beautifully cooked. It was rested, but still hot. There were some delicious herbs and some buttery goodness on the steak, but neither was a detriment. The steak was perfect. \u00a0Side dishes were no afterthoughts, either. Spring pea risotto with tender braised pork was the best risotto I've eaten in my life. I'm baffled as to how they made it. Spring ramps were sauteed simply and paired well with the steaks, and some perfectly roasted hen of the woods mushrooms were a lot of a very good thing. Thank God I saved room for desert. I was going to try the monkey bread pudding, but when I saw a chocolate souffle with hazelnut ice cream, I almost died. When the dish arrived , I popped the top, poured the caramel sauce down the hatch, and tried it with some ice cream. Wow. That's all I can say about that.

I am a big fan of Top Chef but I was not going to let that create a biased opinion. I was staying at the MGM so I chose to have dinner at SteakCraft.Started with Foie Gras (perfectly done with cherry chutney) and Fresh Oysters from the east coast (cant remember which) which tasted fresh out of the sea. Entree selection was the grilled 16 oz. Ribeye prepared Rare. It was incredibly moist and tender (melted in my mouth). Despite the delicate interior of the steak, the outside did not lack the punch. There was a nice smoky flavor on the exterior, which was also well seasoned. Fresh thyme leaves enhanced the 1-2 punch combo contrast of a well flavored, savory-smoky exterior with a butter-soft interior. Sides were Mushroom Assortment, Garlic-Leek Gratin, Snap Peas. Mushrooms each had their distinct flavor and texture. My favorite was the White Shimeji which had been flavored with butter but texture was delicate. The Garlic-Leek Gratin was so silky smooth (although bad for the heart) was very soothing to the soul. The Snap Peas were crunchy and cooked to perfection, allowing the natural flavor of the peas to be first priority. The service was executed flawlessly. As my table was ready to straggle out, we were gifted with a generous serving of sorbet and gelato. We started with the Strawberry, and systematically moved to the Peach, Black Cherry, Malt Chocolate, Carmel, finishing with Pistaccio. Each was rich with flavor, no cutting corners here. As a true steak destination, the selection was well available. From Roasted to Grilled, from Lean to Marble to Super Marble (Wagyu and A5), there is something for everyone.

It was hit and miss...mostly miss.They start you off with hot-out-of-the-oven parker house rolls, topped with butter and sea salt. These were excellent.The organic lettuce salad with lemon vinaigrette was wonderful. So fresh and very refreshing. Just perfect.Hubby had the Angus bone-in NY Strip. It was actually tough and didn't taste or have the mouthfeel of prime meat at all.I had the Angus bone-in Ribeye. It was tasty, but also did not seem to be prime. It also was unevenly cut so that the thinner parts were overcooked. (I found this ironic based on how often Tom has judged people on poorly butchered meat!) The steaks arrive in a copper skillet swimming in demi glace. It's a nice way to serve, but you have to like thyme because the herb permeates the steak and the cippolini onion that is served with it.Our sides were french fries (excellent...homemade and crispy), and brussels sprouts with bacon. About half the sprouts were well-done, and caramelized, making them delicious. The other half looked and tasted as though they were steamed, so there is a bit of inconsistency there as well.We finished up with something called Chocolate Decadence which was not very good at all. It looked and tasted like something you'd find in your high-end grocery store bakery case. But the consistency was \"gloppy\" and also had chocolate nibs throughout, making a terrible \"too crunchy\" texture in random areas that didn't seem intentional. It was like chewing bebes.

The rating is also based upon a comparison with comprable restaurants as Craftsteak would get five stars if I compared it to Sizzler. (sorry all you sizzler fans)I expected an overpriced steak house so the three rating is not a reflection of price so much as it is of value. \u00a0For instance, I have had 5 star experiences at Hank's and Delmonicos.From the moment I walked in, I was disappointed. \u00a0While I expected a somewhat less glitzy environment, I felt like I was in the Hofbrauhaus as the place was jam packed with tables, noisy and the decor seemed uninspired (cow paintings, really? And not very good ones either). \u00a0I have to give a shout out to the 5 star service we received. \u00a0The waitstaff was amazing. \u00a0Yet I found it disconcerting that the dining manager was out in the dining area discussing issues and business within four feet of the diners.We started with the diver sea scallop appetizer which was exactly as advertised and well prepared so I began to feel at ease. \u00a0The waiter suggests the scallops or the lobster bisque but we knew we could never finish two appetizers and our meal. The drinks, although pricy were creative and excellent as well.I ordered the rib eye and my dining partner ordered the surf and turf. \u00a0We ordered sides of mixed exotic mushrooms and grits with bacon. \u00a0The sides were excellent and the grits may well have been the best dish of the meal even if grits aren't your thing.The main course arrived and well I can only say I was overwhelmed by the size and underwhelmed by the taste. \u00a0The large 18 OZ ribeye looked so good in the metal pan that I couldn't wait to dig in. \u00a0But first I have to rewind. \u00a0I like my steak medium rare most of the time but I find good steakhouses tend to think rare = raw, medium rare = rare etc. \u00a0So I asked the waiter what the chef's medium rare was. \u00a0The waiter told me medium rare was red center, pink surrounding and medium rare was pink all the way through. \u00a0So I went with medium rare. \u00a0Unfortunately it came out red all the way through. \u00a0Im ok with that but I would have gone with medium had I known. \u00a0 The steak was well seasoned but the meat was much tougher than I have had at other steak houses and the marbling was not rendered down enough causing a rough cut.The Lobster was nearly flavorless and chewy. \u00a0The filet was cooked medium but was actually medium rare so we enjoyed it but it too did not pack a punch.We looked at the desert menu but I was already disenchanted so I refrained. \u00a0My dining partner had the souffle which was not in the top 5 souffle's we have had, even at less distinguished establishments.So while the meal was above a chain and probably above most off strip places, it earns a 3 which according to Yelp means A-OK which satisfies my review standards. \u00a04 would mean I was a fan which I am not and will not go back short of someone offering to pay for the meal which was pricey (2 people, 4 drinks, 1 app, 2 steaks and 2 sides nearly $400.00. \u00a0They do offer fixed price meals with choices which would have given us more food for only a little more money but we didn't finish what we had and were glad we didn't opt for the extra side and dessert.Bottom line, while this is a premium steak house there are many equal or better choices for the same price or less within 15 miles. \u00a0I could list about 10 off the top of my head if anyone wants to know. \u00a0I'll make a list if some of you readers ask.", "Date": "2012-09-06", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Haleh H.", "ReviewID": "bVOI8XdhucRZJ9nzhGW0XA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'd give it 3.5 stars!Overall a really good elegant restaurant.However, one of our steaks was not cooked properly, it was rather fully cooked than medium rare (pink).The side dishes were just ok.

I knew this ahead of time (that is, before my birthday), so I researched Vegas steakhouses, and was very intrigued by the menu at Craftsteak (particularly the side dishes), so I made a reservation for my boyfriend and me. We showed up at the scheduled time and were promptly seated at a spot between the door and the bar, which means it was kind of noisy. No big deal, though. The seating was quite comfortable, very living room-esque. I was okay with that. Because we have the unfortunate curse of being red wine haters, we started with champagne (err...sparkling wine) from Italy. It was some of the best I've had. In fact, I'd like more now. \u00a0While munching on the tasty garlic bread, we decided on what to order. I got the roasted pepper salad, Alan got the beet salad, and we decided to share a ribeye and kale. I know that a steakhouse should be primarily known for its steak, but I was entirely too impressed with the salads we got, especially my roasted peppers. I mean, I love me some roasted peppers in any context, but it tasted like they put crack in these or something. I wanted two or three more plates of them, but then I wouldn't have room for my steak. The beets were also fresh and tasty, and I got to try a pickled egg for the first time. (It came with the beets, and I approved.) Now, that ribeye. They said it was 16 ounces but it had to be more than that. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, just beautiful. The only thing was that my steak knife seemed pretty dull, so I had more difficulty than I'd expect cutting through the beef. That obviously didn't affect the taste, though. The kale had been braised with bacon and navy beans and had a great savory and bitter (but not too bitter!) flavor. We were so packed by the end of the meal that we couldn't finish all of the kale. However, it was my birthday, so I wanted to get dessert anyway. I knew that one of the big desserts was out of the question, so I got some of the chocolate malt ice cream, which was absolutely splendid.

The red peppers really brought out a nice flavor to the cheese.Caesar Salad - nothing really spectacular about this, other than it being a standard Caesar with ultra fresh ingredients. If you like anchovies like I do, you'd probably want a couple more.Wagyu Carpacio - excellent. Wagyu carpacio with a quail egg in the middle. This was insanely tender and flavorful, and went well with the crusty bread.Avocado Salad - also amazing... what stood out were the onions and cucumbers which were a perfect sweet and sour, which aided in complimenting the creaminess of the avocado.Roasted Corn - the server said this would be the best side... and I agree. This was amazing... perfectly roasted, sweet, and just the texture... crunchy poppy... Chive Potato Puree - too salty. a lot of butter which is normally good but it was definitely over slated. This makes me sad only because I love chives and potatoes. I still inhaled it though.Mushroom Assortment - this was OK... a good assortment of mushrooms that had a variety of textures and flavors that ranged from very woody to chewy. Maybe i expected portabellos...Wagyu Filet - not gonna lie... this was incredibly tender, and you could really notice that there was a higher fat content in this than typical filets by the way the flavor was retained. Perfectly cooked rare to our (my)_ liking. And like most good steaks, the seasoning was simple.Wagyu Ribeye - surprisingly leaner than i expected, considering I've had my share of great steaks. I was expecting this to have tons more fat equating to tons more flavor. This is the first time I prefered the filet over the rib eye. I also realized that I may prefer aged rib eyes as well.Monkey Bread - very similar to what Janette makes, with the only difference being that the dough was less dense. Apricot and Citrus Sorbet - another great dessert to cut the richness of the dishes. A good amount of citrus acidity and flavorStrawberry shortcake (modern take/deconstructed). very interesting take, with the rice crispy adding a great textural flavor. The strawberry ice was refreshing but had a slight amount of bitterness. This also cut the richness from the meal.Assorted seasonl fruits - plane jane stuff. All were sweet. nothing really spectacular but still also a refreshing end.Overall the meal was great... a lot of highs and a few disappointments.

It's nearly the end of Restaurant Week, and this was our only stop! \u00a0We were excited by the menu, and had wanted to try the place for a while, so it seemed like the perfect time. We booked an early dinner, which meant that we got a great booth where we could sit next to each other and share food.After we sat down, they brought us the most amazing fresh-baked bread. Think King's Hawaiian rolls, but homemade in a cast iron pan and way more buttery. I'm not ashamed to say that we finished the first six rolls and asked for more. Our drink orders were easy: Two Chimay Reds at $10 apiece. Chimay is pricey anyway, so this wasn't a bad deal, plus this beer goes with absolutely everything! Dev isn't a wine drinker, and I prefer beer as well, plus the wine list was really pricey, so we figured Chimay would serve us well. The best part was when the waiter came to take our order. There was a choice of four appetizers, three entrees, and three sides, or so I thought. The waiter asked how we would like our steak cooked. Confused, I looked at him and said, \"Oh, I'll have the scallops.\" He said, \"You get everything.\" That's right, for Restaurant Week at Craftsteak, you get four appetizers, three entrees, \u00a0three sides, plus two desserts, for $50 a person. Deal. So we said we'd like our steak medium rare.Our four appetizers came out very quickly. I like quick service. The fennel salad was great; it was raw shaved fennel with a citrusy dressing. It's not for everyone but I love fennel, so I finished the plate. The other salad, a cucumber-arugula affair, was good for me and not good for Dev. I think he had a problem with the flavor of the arugula, and he also dislikes cucumber. I love both, so I liked it. The roasted quail was amazing; even the grapes that were served with it tasted as if they had been fire-roasted. The buffalo mozzarella was also delicious. It was topped with a sort of bell pepper \"tapenade.\" I don't like bell peppers, but these were roasted, and it tasted really great.I'll move on to the side dishes before the entrees. The side dishes were a sweet corn warm salad, a dish of shiitake mushrooms, and a potato puree. The corn dish was the best corn I've ever had. I'm not even normally a fan of corn, but I had seconds. The mushrooms, well, they were fantastic. I love mushrooms in almost any form, but the flavor of these mushrooms was perfect, just earthy and great. The potato puree was just about as good as the one I had at Robuchon, meaning that it's about half heavy cream and half potato. The chives were a nice touch.The entrees. Here is where we said medium-rare on the steak. We had both skirt steak and a prime beef flat iron steak. The skirt steak was perfect at a med-rare, but I think looking back I would have ordered the flat iron at a medium, since it was cut thicker. Both steaks were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The scallop dish was two sea scallops in a lemon cream sauce with some shaved fennel on top. I \u00a0lucked out because Devin only wanted a taste, so I got to eat almost the whole dish. They were cooked perfectly, which you don't always see with restaurant scallops. \u00a0The dessert course was more than I expected. The \"Pastry Chef's Selection of Confections, Ice Cream, and Sorbet,\" turned out to be two composed dishes. One was a chocolate panna cotta with a caramel sauce, and the other was a peach concoction, with meringue, whipped cream, fresh peaches, and peach sorbet. I was surprised by how great the peach sorbet was. Not being much of a dessert person (unless it's bread pudding!), I don't usually judge places on their desserts. If desserts were very important to me, these two would have more than passed the test. The service was impeccable, professional, and efficient. The layout of the restaurant is interesting. I'm glad we were among the first reservations, because we got a great booth in the back. I suspect they give the walk-ins the tables in the front that are open to the rest of the casino, including tacky people walking in from the pool in just their swimsuits. Overall, I feel that a five star review is warranted, because the food was fantastic, and I'd go there again even if it was a full-price menu.

Meal of a lifetime. There were more than a few moans coming from our table, at one point my friend put her fist on the table after her first bite of something delectable, and I believe I may have threatened to fight my companions for the monkey bread. But back to the beginning. We decided to get the Domestic Waygu Chef's tasting. The appetizers included bread with sea salt, a warm frisse bacon blue cheese salad, prawns, prosciutto, and another salad with a raspberry vinagrette. Normally when someone says the bread \u00a0was a standout, that implies everything else wasn't too good. But in this case, the bread was Just. That. Good. Didn't even need butter, in my opinion.Next was the meat. Filet, new york strip, and ribeye. The new york strip was my favorite--every piece was like butter. Sides were risotto, potato puree, and honey glazed carrots with rosemary. They were all good, but the meat was amazing, and the reason we came in the first place, so we beasted our way through the meat and left a bit of the sides behind. At this point, we were all a bit weary with the meal. We asked our server for a bit more time to digest before dessert. Throughout the entire meal, the service was stellar--we started off with them offering to switch our white napkins to black ones, so my friend's black outfit wouldn't get all lint-y. They continued being attentive throughout the meal. After a bit more time to attempt to digest, dessert arrived. The infamous monkey bread with ice cream (do not remember what flavor), chocolate souffle with hazlenut ice cream (YUM), a fresh fruit plate that went largely untouched, vanilla bean cheesecake with cream, and a trio of sorbets (orange-basil, a raspberry with something else, and another flavor I do not remember, but it was creamy). As another reviewer said, it was the best cheesecake of my life. However, even with that, the sorbet and monkey bread were so over the top with amazingness that it went largely untouched. There is no way to describe the monkey bread, only it may have been the best dessert of this sweet tooth's life. The raspberry sorbet was so tart it almost tasted fizzy, which I loved. I wasn't the biggest fan of the orange-basil as a dessert, but it would be refreshing as hell poolside. All in all, worth every penny--even though it was a good quarter of a paycheck.

Not the case here. We were served a 3 course brunch with 5 dishes per course. The more the food came out, the better it kept getting. Every other word out of my mouth was \"wow\" or \"holy sh*t this is good\". Ok the latter was in my head. Among the notables, braised pork belly that melted in your mouth and the wagyu skirt steak in salsa verde that was cooked to perfection. I am a carnivore at heart and wow, those were seriously some of the best pieces of meat in my life. The food is simple too, nothing too overtly gourmet and complicated. Simple food, tons of flavor and noticeable quality. If this is the kind of food they serve at an event I fear how awesome it would be on a regular night when you're getting something made to order. The service was impeccable. If you got up to go to the restroom you came back to your napkin being refolded in your spot. It's details like that that set a place apart.

You have a team of people waiting on you. We had team 4. The leader of team 4 was Kevin and he was excellent... courteous, funny, helpful, prompt, etc. Olga was the main woman getting our things and she did a very good job. There was only one mistake the whole meal and that was refilling a drink. She brought my friends drink instead of mine, but then Kevin came over and said don't worry about it, keep it, and here's your drink. Mistake corrected. We decided to get the Three Course Domestic Wagyu Beef Meal for $130 a person. They were participating in the Three Squared meal event for $50 a person, but we opted to go for the gusto and get a better meal (and deal, at least in this place). They seem to be a big martini place. I'm not really a martini type of person, but, I thought when in Rome... So, I got the Expresso Martini. Sounds unique enough and I needed some caffeine to balance out my continual alcohol intake. Without a doubt, it was one of the best drinks I've had... and then had again. My friend had the Key Lime Martini... and it was excellent as well. Now the food. The homemade starter rolls were good. They had that little touch by having some sea salt on them. But, don't do more than one. Despite our alcohol blood level, we knew to wait for the meal. We were then presented with our appetizer which consisted of Caesar Salad with Anchovies, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, and Shrimp Cocktail. The shrimp were the size of my hand and very good for being so large. The mozzarella was in a 25 year old port sauce... yumm. Then, came the beef. We requested the ribeye and the filet. I guess I should back up a bit. The Domestic Wagyu Beef Meal is what the chef decides to throw together, but you can make suggestions, and we did... at least for the steaks. The steaks were exquisite. They were perfectly cooked, tender beyond belief, and the flavor... amazing. This course also came with Roasted White Corn... incredible, asparagus... good (for me, the one thing that approached average), and the Yukon Gold Pur\u00e9e Potatoes... worth every bite.

They don't deserve a 3, however.I went here with my girlfriend as the main culinary experience of our trip that has been 3 years in the making. The walk from Treasure Island took 30 minutes. With reservations made a week in advance, seating was not an issue. They did make us wait 20 minutes since we got there at 8:10 instead of 8:30, however.I was wearing a polo shirt and jeans and my girlfriend wore a casual spring dress and we never felt underdressed. I suppose the very dim dining room helped with that.We went with the $60 summer tasting menu. The items on it can be found on Andrew W.'s review on this page.The meal started out with PERFECT bread. It was nearly a brioche with sea salt on the crunchy top, with a perfectly soft and buttery inside.The three starters (brought out all at once) were good too. I enjoyed the tender, juicy quail the most. My girlfriend said that hers was neither, unfortunately. She preferred the cold roasted bell peppers, which I liked as well. We were both glad to find out that watercress salads aren't as bitter as they sound.The three main courses, however, were a disappointment. The divers scallops were good--at least for me. My girlfriend didn't like biting down on sand three times.The fried chicken was terrible for me (I ate a piece of breast meat which was terribly dry and flavorless) but the legs were tender and juicy.The Kobe beef ribeye was the worst dish of the meal, however. I've had Wagyu before, which might have been part of the disappointment. We were also partially to blame by getting the meat too well done, I think. We realized immediately after we had ordered that Medium Well would be too much, but we hoped it would be okay. Unfortunately, it wasn't all our fault. The meat itself had hardly any marbling. At the high heat we chose, the fat should have melted even more and the meat shouldn't have been so tough and dry. I'm sad to say that the Kobe beef at the Bellagio buffet was more delicious.The sides (again, 3 of them), were decent. Sweet corn (nothing special there), garlic potato gratin (a substitute for the mashed potatoes), and the sauteed shitake mushrooms (dry, rubbery, poorly seasoned).By the time we were halfway done with the main courses, we were exhausted. It's a problem, in my mind, that patrons don't feel guilty when they leave half of their main courses sitting on the table. It wasn't delicious enough to force yourself to eat some more.When dessert rolled out (again, all at once), we were floored. Monkey bread (too sweet), chocolate lava cake (okay), sorbets & ice creams (thank God for something light), and blueberries & raspberries finished the meal.While th meal started out well, it didn't continue the upward trend. It's a sad day when a steakhouse's meat loses out to its bread & its roasted peppers.An enjoyable evening, but I don't miss it.====Rubric: 5 = Mindblowing 4 = Excellent 3 = I see the charm 2 = Disappointing 1 = Never again", "Date": "2008-06-30", "Author_Location": "Cupertino, CA"}, {"Author": "Amanda K.", "ReviewID": "Vfp77BBHQTFeudb1B_izSA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came here with a group of 7 to enjoy a celebration dinner.

I thought some things were done very well such as the steak, but I was not a fan of other dishes. I'd give it 3.5-4 stars.Started to the meal with beet salad appetizer. The beets were beautiful but didn't quite have enough taste... it needed more salt or something. But I did appreciate the natural sweetness of the beets and the 3 different types of beets on my plate.My sister ordered the short ribs and honestly it was WAY too salty. Like almost inedible. Tried to pair it with some sides but it was just still too much.I ordered the surf and turf, 6 oz. filet mignon with half a Maine lobster. The steak is excellent. It's tender and flavored well with that nice meaty taste. The lobster was cooked well and not overcooked but had a very slight fishy taste. Portions are generous (prices are expensive too but the cuts of meat are thick).We also ordered 2 sides: the snap peas with horseradish and the hen of wood mushrooms. The snap peas were delicious with lots of butter but you couldn't taste the horseradish shavings. The hen of wood mushrooms were amazing! They had a nice earthy taste and the top of the mushroom was slightly crispy but the root was chewy. It had so much flavor and really wowed me.Dessert we tried the mini apple donuts and the ice cream/sorbet platters. The mini apple fritters had a nice crispy outside but the inside was too doughy. The consistency was slightly off. Also, I wanted them to be really hot and freshly fried but they were warm and not hot enough to my liking. Ice cream/sorbets were solid and I enjoyed the lemon, kiwi, and hazelnut best.The decor was great and warm feeling. The restaurant is big and definitely packed. We had 2 waiters and I found that kind of awkward... they would switch back and forth. Overall, I had a positive experience and I'm glad that I tried it.

The tables and chairs did not seem sturdy, I'm sorry call me picky, but I feel like if a restaurant is going to charge me $50 for a rib eye steak then I need the tables dressed with white lining and the servers with white gloves on. The bread made up for the Ikea furniture, as soon as the bread hits your mouth theres a buttery sweetness with a hint of salty, melts in your mouth and warm comfort goodness.I ordered the rib-eye with gratin potatoes with warm salad with bacon and egg. The salad was very good, unusual but delightful. The steak could have used alot more flavor and the potatoes was just okay (I've had BETTER). The only other thing that stood out was the short ribs and the broccoli. There was another dish which I can't remember the name, but it was a rosotto like dish with brown rice, butternut squash, mushrooms and other components that I can not recollect. Lastly, which may seem very trivial to everyone else but my party seem to take offense to it as well. One of our friends needed his food togo so the server took his plate to bag it up. To come back with a \"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU\" bag (YES THE SAME BAG) any chinese fast food restaurant would give you for togo order.

First, we were served with the house bread (complimentary), then the most delicious lobster bisque was served, accompanied with 3 different types of salad.

The strip loin area was amazing as well, served with the following side dishes: wild mushrooms, scalloped potatoes, asparagus. (so much food!)

Here were the standouts: Course 0: Um...the bread is glazed with butter and covered in sea salt. Even my annoyingly health-conscious dining companion who doesn't eat butter or carbs ate butter and carbs. Course 1: I rarely exclaim aloud at good food anymore, but the quail got an \"oh wow\" from this relatively jaded foodie. This was the best course in my opinion- the cucumber salad and the fennel salad were both excellent and my friend puts his vote in for the fresh mozzarella. Course 2: Oh diver scallops, I'd eat you for the rest of my life if I could. No, really. The two other dishes, both steak, were solid if unremarkable. Cooked to my instruction on the rare side, which I appreciated. Course 2b: Um, there were sides? The corn salad was good, but I could not fathom eating any more at this point. My friend gladly ate all the mushrooms, so I infer his recommendation. Course 3: Sigh, is anything more disappointing than digging into what you think is a blueberry crisp only to find that it is rhubarb? I'm not a fan of rhubarb solo (look, it's like putting celery with sugar into a pie!), but the crisp itself was nice and topped with a wonderful homemade vanilla.

We asked for medium and the filet mignon was more like well done. The NY strip and porterhouse were better than the filet, but they were just ok. I've had much better steak at other restaurants.

Would his restaurant live up to the hype and high standards he espouses on Top Chef? After having enjoyed a dinner at Craftsteak, I can honestly and emphatically say, YES! And then some. This is how a Top Chef restaurant should be run. The food is exceptional, the restaurant decor is soothing and low-keyed, and the service is world-class without being stuffy or formal. We decided to splurge and order the 3-course Wagyu Beef Tasting. If you are an adventurous diner, I highly recommend putting your taste buds in the hands of the chef. I suggest it for those die-hard foodies like me who enjoy the variety and surprise of a tasting menu selected by the chef. The Wagyu beef choice did not disappoint. It was in fact, Foodie Heaven. Yes, it was on the expensive side but well worth the cost. Every dish was well prepared and seasoned to perfection. The beef was tender and flavorful and there was plenty of it. I especially enjoyed the Wagyu Tartare served with small rounds of toast. And not to be outdone, Chef Colicchio has a genius for a pastry chef at this location. Of the four different desserts we enjoyed, the mascarpone cheese cake bordered on sinful, not to mention the velvety-rich chocolate sorbet.If you're in Las Vegas and want the very best dining experience that this city has to offer go to Craftsteak.

I made reservations for 7 people for Saturday night at 6pm.

We went with one of their recommendations: Veraison Synchrony 2004 (Napa Valley). It is mostly a Cab franc/sauvignon blend with a bit of malbec and merlot. It was very smooth and complemented the steak perfectly!! I looked at my local wine shop and they carry it at $60 a bottle. Considering we payed less than $100 for it, it wasn't too much of a mark up (and you know what I mean... Bottles that cost $10 at Ralphs are sometimes 6 or 7 times that at a restaurant!).Another thing worth mentioning is that my boyfriend and I stayed at the MGM through the PRIMA deal. This deal entails that you are going to spend $500 through out the MGM Grand resorts and you get special deals like 2 for 1 entrees at the MGM restaurant, 2 for 1 drinks at the bars, free entrance at wet republic, etc. etc. Even though most of our group stayed at the MGM, my boyfriend and I were the only ones that got the PRIMA deal and thought that they would only give us our entrees at 2 for 1.

Lobster (about 1 lb for ea person): This was cook al dente. Some people might think it's under cooked but it's not. Al dente lobster has the perfect texture and has that great lobster taste you can't beat. But here, even though I loved the lobster, the Wagyu beef was the superstar. Potato Puree (Yukon Gold): Buttery and creamy; the best potato puree I've had. This is a must side dish because the buttery taste matches very well with the beef or the lobster. Risotto: It has stringy chucks of pork in it. Savory and the right amount of moister. They have this side dish down to a science.

It's even poured table side to give a little pizzazz. I also had the caesar salad, which tasted great. My only complaint would be the whole anchovies served on top of the salad. (It's weird seeing little slivers of fish sitting on top of your salad, at least to me.)We wanted to try two different preparations of steak, so we had the NY strip (which is grilled) and the TBone (which is roasted). I'm really glad we chose two extremely different ones because it was the best way to taste the subtle differences in each. The NY strip had a really great charred, smokey flavor. The TBone has a much softer, buttery texture and is more mild (less of that heavy \"meaty\" taste). I preferred the NY strip, but the TBone was more interesting and unique.For sides we had the potato gratin and the hen of the woods mushroom. We had a hard time picking the mushrooms because I wanted to get just one type ( I thought the the assortment was a little too expensive at $24 compared to the $14 for one). Our server explained each and we ended up choosing the hen, which has a smokey, robust flavor. Both the gratin and mushroom paired perfectly with our steak.We skipped dessert because we were too full, but it looked appetizing so I'd recommend trying to save some room for dessert.

Time ticks by and finally the 2nd round of the steak comes out. Still, they were bordering medium and medium-well. By this time, we were hungry and tired; we suck it up and eat it. The flat iron, they seemed to have missed the tough connective issue at one end. Very unacceptable for restaurants of this caliber. But I'm not a huge complainer, so we sucked it up and ate it. The rib was okay but just lost its tenderness from overcooking. And I think the steak didn't have time to properly sit before it came out as juices came flowing out when we made the first cut.

I was sooo anxious waiting for my food to come...which did take awhile. But when it finally came, I was in food heaven. Or close to it. The sirloin was fairly tender, juicy, and pre-sliced. The roasted part of the sirloin was tasty and not burnt. Mmmm it was delicious! I tasted a bit of my boyfriend's Ribeye which was more tender and enjoyable. I think I would prefer the sirloin over the ribeye there. We also had a side of the Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms. They were okay...nothing too special.

The server asked my girlfriend and I to slice the steak in half to see if it was overdone (although it shouldn't matter), we did and she said she'll take our steak back. IMO a server especially at a steakhouse should never ask you to cut your steak in half. I'm paying $50! It better be perfect!As we munch our french fries and sweet corn, the manager came over to let us know another medium rare steak would arrive soon, and they will give us a new order of hot sides to make sure everything goes well together. I wasn't mad nor angry simply because I had faith they would get things right. Again, when the food arrive, it was medium (close to medium rare) once again. At this time, we did not want to send the food back and just decided to eat it anyway instead of waiting for another 30 minutes for them to correct it again.A steakhouse should know how to prepare a medium rare steak.

\u00a0Dude, I'm straight but I will pimp you one of my friends if it means you keep bringing wine.So, we're at the end of the meal and the check comes. \u00a0I know it's north of $500 so I don't bother looking and just throw my card down and Ev does the same. \u00a0Vader is still checking his wallet, surveying the bill, and then looks up to say, \"you guys are gonna have to spot me, I didn't know you were going to order all that wine,\" and puts forth no money. \u00a0Those of you reading this with even scant intelligence can imagine the ensuing conversation so I'll spare you.But I'm obviously arrested at the notion that he just went an entire dinner in an establishment that he recommended knowing that he didn't have any money and ordered the most expensive shit on the menu and didn't say a word until the bill arrives!I'm the kinda guy who won't make you feel stupid; I'll just bring it up down the road at a time of my convenience. \u00a0Ev...a different story. \u00a0He blows his stack. \u00a0And Vader has the audacity to get indignant about his attack. \u00a0Now I'm starting to fume because the whole thing is obviously premeditated and now Vader is claiming it's not his fault but ours. \u00a0Okaayyyy...I put Vader's chunk on my tab and when he's in the bathroom, we ditch him for the night. \u00a0I mean sh*t, it's the least we could get away with given how rightfully pissed we were at this twat. \u00a0Plus, believe it or not, this not the second time this has happened, but the third time I've had to pick up someone else's tab, in Vegas. \u00a0Never go to Vegas with anyone who can't afford it.We leave, hook up with some friends, get in a cab, direct it to Tryst and a comedy of error ensues beyond imagination...", "Date": "2009-06-28", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Sarah H.", "ReviewID": "Mm9A8SlEoBcbusm59sYgAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Restaurant Week '10 was the perfect excuse to get into Craftsteak. \u00a0I am a fan of Colicchio and had been thinking about going for quite some time, plus Restaurant Week supports 3-Square which is a worthwhile charity.We had an easy time getting reservations for our party of 3, and when we arrived, we were seated promptly. \u00a0It took a while for our server to get our drink orders (my only complaint, really), but the bartender didn't skimp on the good stuff. \u00a0The inside of the restaurant was gorgeous, subtle lighting, earthy colors, and it isn't loud inside. \u00a0I would strongly recommend a reservation on a weekend night, though; it looked like people who were waiting for a table were put at the entrance right along the shopping area outside - very bright and noisy.The special menu for Restaurant Week was a great value because instead of choosing one option from the menu for each course, they were all delivered to our table and served family style along with hot buttery rolls.First course was a fennel salad, fresh buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts and roasted red pepper, a cucumber and watercress salad and some super delicious quail. \u00a0All four dishes had flavors that complimented each other; it wasn't a haphazard selection. \u00a0I keep writing that the quail was the star and then deleting it thinking, \"no the mozzarella was so delicate, the cucumber salad so crisp and refreshing.\" \u00a0It was all great.The main course was a selection of prime beef flat iron, grilled skirt steak, and diver scallops. \u00a0The scallops were to die for, but the steak was good too. \u00a0Despite thinking of skirt steak as something I buy to cut into strips for stir fry or steak sandwiches, I preferred it over the flat iron. \u00a0It had a really flavorful crust and was tender and juicy. \u00a0I didn't know skirt steak could be made like that! \u00a0We also had 3 sides to go with our meats: shitake mushrooms, yukon gold potato puree (yum!), and sweet corn with green onions. \u00a0We ate all of the potato puree and sweet corn, but the shitake mushrooms were a little bland compared to everything else. \u00a0For dessert we had a selection of chocolate panacotta, cheesecake with blackberries, and a pastry with peaches and raspberry sorbet. \u00a0Get the chocolate pannacotta. \u00a0You will be happy.I really enjoyed myself at Craftsteak, especially after the disappointment that was Mesa Grill. \u00a0I'd like to go back and try a \"fancier\" cut of beef off the a la carte menu, but I can't complain about the taste and value of the meal I had for Restaurant Week.", "Date": "2010-09-06", "Author_Location": "Portland, OR"}, {"Author": "Johnny P.", "ReviewID": "20BVFOD_HI9RM50d35qT1A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My first time to this place was back in January 2011 after it was recommended by a friend. This place is not cheap by any means between myself and two others, the bill came to about $400. But my issue isn't so much with the money as it is the quality and value I expected to get for that price.I went on the cheaper side by getting a Surf and Turf for $65. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad either. I thought the lobster was actually better than the steak. My friend ordered the Surf and Turf as well and he shared the same opinion: it was just OK. The bottom line is: It wasn't worth $400.Afterwards, I shared my disappointment with the friend who recommended this place to me. He said Surf and Turf wasn't the way to go and I should've ordered the Wagyu beef or filet. So a couple of days ago, I gave it another shot.We went with a group of 12 people. The waiter highly recommended the chef special where you can get three courses but at least two people have to order it. I asked what the difference was between the beef in the Surf and Turf and the one in the special. He said the Surf and Turf was a grade 6 (it was 6 or 7) and the special was a grade 9. So I decided to join two others and placed the order.We got three different cuts of Wagyu beef with this combo. There was filet mignon, new york, and ribeye. We asked for medium rare but all three cuts came out as medium. It was pink in the center but all three of us felt that it was overdone. When we compared all three with our friends who ordered just the standalone filet, theirs was actually done just right. Somehow, medium rare for the standalone was better and done correctly but the more expensive one was not. Go figure.To say the least, the waiter was nice about it and gave good service throughout the entire time. He took back all three cuts and asked the kitchen to give us new ones. That took about 10 to 15 mins. Once the food came, it came out just the way we asked and expected...medium rare. It was tender and very pink for all three cuts.None of us were able to finish all the beef. I think part of the reason was that it was too rich. The amount of oil from the serving dish was pretty thick. We had asparagus, mushroom risotto, and baby spinach as sides so they contributed to the feast.Here's my bottom line. I gave this place second try and it didn't really make me feel any better. I spent quite a bit more this time...$175 for my meal and the overall experience was just barely OK. I'd never come back here again because I don't feel like it's worth my money.

He was honest, funny, and made me and my boyfriend feel comfortable dining at Craftsteak.It was my boyfriends birthday weekend in Vegas and I reserved a table at Craftsteak. I had to change our reservation 3 times because we were running late but they were still very kind on the phone and had no problem with it. The interior atmosphere was amazing. It gave off a very calm and serene feeling with warm accents. It was not too loud, and we were seated in a round booth that had privacy on both sides while still being able to look out at most of the restaurant. The restaurant is actually a lot bigger than it seems from the outside. We were seated and I asked for recommendations on the wine and Kevin was very knowledgeable throughout the entire dinner, giving us suggestions that went with what we liked and had already ordered. My boyfriend ordered the Big Reds of Cali which included Brothers Ridge, Ladera, and Stuhlmmuller Vineyards which was 60$ total for all three glasses. The wine was delicious and they poured a good amount.We ended up getting the pre-fixed meal of $140 per person for the Domestic Wagyu beef selections. Within the meal we were each given a cup of lobster bisque soup, allowed to pick 3 half order salads, 2 different Wagyu beefs, 3 half order side dishes, and a variety dessert. For salads, we chose the Handcut Wagyu Tartare which was AMAZING, the Prosciutto, and the Persian Cucumber salad. For the sides, we got the Potato Puree which was very creamy and flavorful, Assorted Mushrooms, and Asparagus. For the meats, we got the 10 oz. Wagyu Filet rare and 14 oz Wagyu Ribeye medium rare. The steaks were already cut, which probably made it cool off faster, but we thought that it was still delicious. It came out the perfect temperature on a skillet. For dessert we were given the Cinnamon Monkey Bread [with a nicely written happy birthday on it], a scoop of Cranberry Buttermilk Sorbet, and Banana Rum Ice cream, White Chocolate Cheesecake (my favorite), and an assortment of Farmers Market Fruit.Throughout the whole time we were ordering, Kevin kept giving helpful suggestions to what we liked that made us feel like he truly wanted us to have a great dining experience. For example we wanted the tartare, the prosciutto, and my boyfriend wanted to try the warm frisee, which had bacon in it. Kevin wisely told us maybe we should go with a Persian cucumber salad to balance out how many different types of meats we would be eating. Turns out his years of working there had paid off and it was the right choice to go. He also recommended the well known potato puree, and when I asked about the Maui Onions, he immediately said you dont want to get that because your meal already comes with onions on the side. Wonderful! Most servers wouldnt even let you know that.. And finally the funniest part was when he said to make some sliders with the bread rolls by assuring us that putting in the meat and some potato puree, we would undoubtedly melt in our seats because of how amazing it tastes. This surely happened..It was by far one of the best steakhouses we have ever been to with excellent service, and absolutely worth the money. I would recommend getting the prefixed meal because the quality of the food most definitely amounts to what you pay for it.The only problem is, it was pretty difficult for us to finish all that food. We tried to eat all of the steak because we knew it probably wouldn't taste as good to go, but we ended up taking a lot of the sides to go. Kevin even gave us 6 more fresh rolls of the bread to go!

So, let me start with the sides. We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25, I'm very disappointed. Now, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl. On to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered. Overview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks).

It was a good thing that I did my research because when i got there, there was no offering of the lower priced restaurant week menu. \u00a0If not for a little research we'd all be spending $150 kobe beef and lobster.The following was served family style.1st course: Shaved fennel salad, grilled quail, buffalo mozzarella and a cucumber salad.My favorite was the quail, it was tender and moist; for my first taste of quail i was impressed. \u00a0I didn't care for the fennel salad it was too crunchy for my taste. Main course: Prime flat iron steak, Angus skirt steak, and Diver sea scallops.My favorite of the 3 was the scallop, there was one per person and it left me wanting more. \u00a0The steaks were, well... steak, nothing extraordinary. \u00a0I usually order rib eye if i have a choice, but for $50 for everything, i was not complaining.The sides were the star of the evening, Yukon gold potato puree, sauteed sweet corn, roasted shiitake mushrooms and we ordered a side of risotto. \u00a0The corn was sauteed in tons of butter but was not greasy. \u00a0The potato puree was \u00a0creamy and buttery. Dessert was a mix of cheese cake, monkey bread and chocolate cake. \u00a0The desserts were good too, maybe the best cheese cake i've had, it was not as heavy and dense as others. \u00a0Monkey bread was covered with ooey-gooey deliciousness. i'd recommend going here just for dessert if you happen to be in the MGM. \u00a0Pros: restaurant week provided a good deal at $50Cons: the drunk people next to us dropping the F-bomb every other word, calling his girl a bitch and talking to other people at his table like they were across the room. \u00a0i think the entire restaurant heard his conversation. Verdict:over all for $50 it was a good deal but i was not overwhelmed by the steak but of course i didn't get the Japanese Kobe and i wasn't about to spend upwards of $120 to try it. \u00a0 After all it is what it is a steak house, straight forward food done simple. \u00a0So it lived up to its name, but i guess i was expecting more since we had been eating at other french restaurants earlier which is the exact opposite; refined, subtle, and complex. Note: The restaurant is decorated all modern and fancy but the bathroom has the feel of a real steak house. \u00a0Pictures of Cows, and the sink resembles a feed trough.

We got a 10PM reservation and we waited about 15 minutes before being seated. The inside is pretty big and the decor is pretty much what Craft LA looks like - modern with earthy colors, clean lines and warm light. The service was great. The server was able to answer all of our questions and the sommelier came by when we had questions about wine.The bread they served at the start was hot, fresh, buttery, and sweet. It reminded me of Kings Hawaiian sweet rolls. It didn't need butter, but if you wanted to slather some on for good measure, it was there. We ordered a bottle of red wine and settled in for the meal. I don't remember which red wine we got, but it was very smooth and went well with our meal.We started with the warm frisee salad with bacon and egg. It is one of the most decadent salads I've eaten. The warm egg coated everything in a creamy blanket as you mixed up the salad and the savory crispy bacon punched through as you ate everything together. If salads were always like this, I would eat it every day.For the main course, I got the 12 oz. domestic wagyu skirt steak, medium. Two of my friends shared the 32 oz. dry aged porterhouse, and my other friend got the surf and turf. We also ordered sides of spinach and yukon gold puree. Usually at steakhouses, the meat comes out piping hot because the plate is hot like a space shuttle on reentry. Maybe they just don't do that here, or maybe our food was waiting a while for pickup, but my steak was just lukewarm when it arrived. I was a little disappointed. That said, the skirt steak had great flavor, had perfect tenderness, and I ate the whole thing.I could see my friends that ordered the porterhouse were struggling, and I saw why. It was so massive. I tried a piece, and it had a quick hit of great flavor, but the sheer size of my piece had me munching on it past its flavor burst, like a piece of gum.The sides of spinach and yukon gold puree were tasty too, but also, for some reason, were not very hot when they came out.We didn't get dessert because we were so full, and we didn't want to feel like beached whales.Overall, it was an awesome time with great friends and great food.

I couldn't ask for a more beautiful place to dine.Before I even get to the food I have to also say that the service here is incredible. You can always tell you're in an expensive restaurant. The wait staff just shines. It's no exception here. No empty glasses, excellent wine and drink selections and no waiting for requests. Being waited on hand and foot is exactly my style!Onto the true beauty of this restaurant: the food. Yes, it's a steak restaurant, yes, there are many in Vegas, but none do food quite like Craftsteak. The originality combined with all of the other aspects of this place really elevate it to a different level. The food choices are essentially the same for most steak houses. I had the bone-in ribeye and my associate had bison strip loin which I had never tasted. Mine was delicious. It was a nice size steak with just enough marbling to make it melt in the mouth without it venturing into that fatty, greasy taste. It had a nice seared crust that gave it a little crunch to go with the tenderness. Really a nice combo in the mouth. My associate's bison steak took me aback. I'm not a big fan of alternative meat, if you will. Bison just does not conjure up BBQ if you know what I mean. I see prairies and high grass, not a divine piece of meat on a platter. I'm happy to say I now see it both ways. Bison is extremely tender. I was expecting a gamey taste, the sort found on most wild animals (I know, bison are farm raised, but still - BISON?), but was happily surprised with the mild, tender meat that I encountered. I definitely think if you want to step out of your comfort zone you should try this cut of meat. Delicious. As sides go they have an amazing assortment. My associate surprised me by ordering grits. I KNOW, RIGHT? I, being from Texas, know what a grit is. I will only eat it for my grandmother. UNTIL NOW. This was the best tasting grit I ever had! It was cooked so perfectly, so tenderly that I wanted to ask it why it didn't taste like this when I was a kid, but grits don't talk. Not even in Texas. So, these white corn grits were topped with bacon and Gruyere cheese and let me tell you if that's all you eat I will not tell anyone. They were an explosion of fabulous taste. I was shocked. I will never think of grits the same way again, I can assure you of THAT.We also had the mushroom assortment and they were good, but they weren't done in a way that you'd ask for them again when you went back unless you're a mushroom nut. They were fine, I liked them, next.No dessert here, but that will change next time I go. The assortment they had made my mouth water just reading them!There is an incredible menu here. It's extensive, but don't take that to mean that they don't everything with flair. Nothing gets left behind here and that's surprising. You'll love it, though. Please bring me some grits when you go, okay?

It was kind of hard to speak/reach across the table. I didn't feel it, but my guests were shivering from the AC the entire time. The entire restaurant was fairly dark. A bachelor party was seated in our same room, and everything echoed. Whatever. Everyone's in Vegas to have a good time. There was a wedding party in the next room over.

My buddy doesn't eat the heads, so more for me. They were so sweet, perfectly textured, and perfectly charred on the shell. Being spoiled by Asian food, I'd have to say these were probably the best prawns I've EVER had. If only they'd start serving them salt and peppered. That night, the seafood definitely blew the meat out of the water.My buddy's iced tea came with a mini jug of simple syrup and tons of lemon. His mozzarella \"salad\" was also so so.

For sides to accompany our steaks, we were served the mashed potatoes, mushroom assortment, and risotto. \u00a0My favorite was the mushrooms. \u00a0Our angus steaks included one ribeye and one New York strip. \u00a0Both were prepared perfectly.As you can imagine, when dessert time rolled around, we were already pretty stuffed. \u00a0$120 per person is on the expensive side, but the chef really gives you way more than enough food. \u00a0For dessert, we were served the cinnamon monkey bread, sorbet, \u00a0farmer's market fruit plate, and a flourless chocolate cake with ice cream. \u00a0The monkey bread was my favorite. \u00a0It tasted like a gourmet cinnamon roll.Overall, the service was superb and the food was good. \u00a0I wouldn't say it's the best steak I ever had, but as far as the tasting menu goes, it's the best value. \u00a0However, we ate only half of the food and couldn't take it back to the hotel because we were off to see Ka.", "Date": "2012-01-31", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "JJ C.", "ReviewID": "867b53MMGnTtqR8vKvguyA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went during NYE and even though they were busy the service was excellent. \u00a0One of the best steaks I've had in a really long time. \u00a0Had a terrible dinning experience at MiX earlier and I was a little gun shy but Craft did not disappoint. \u00a0Had the flat iron which was buttery and awesome but the veggies really made the meal great. \u00a0Definitely worth another stop when I'm in vegas again after I curse out the a-holes at mix.", "Date": "2012-03-31", "Author_Location": "Newport Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Alis R.", "ReviewID": "ujtKsKb0BgwASusTxzDE5w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I try my best to eat at a new steakhouse every time I'm in Vegas. This past trip, Craftsteak was one that I had been wanting to try for awhile now. I went here with a party of 5 and we all decided to do the chef's tasting. We ended up doing the wagyu tasting, which I believe was $140 per person. Just FYI, if one person wants to do the tasting, then everyone has to do the tasting, they won't just do it for a few people in your party. It's just because of the way they serve it, family style. But i think the tasting menu is the way to go because you get to try so many things!First off, the service was absolutely amazing. We had two waitresses, but then other waiters/waitresses would come by to check on us as well. Everyone was great and very friendly which is a huge plus for me.We decided to go for the wine pairing because it was easier then trying to find some decent bottles of wine that everyone could agree on. It came with three wines, a chardonnay I think from nickel nickel, a cab from Jordan winery, and then some kind of dessert wine. I'm not usually a fan of white wine, but it did pair well with the first course. First course was all appetizers. I honestly can't remember everything they brought out but there were 5 or 6 appetizers in total that came out and they were all delicious. Second course was the meat and sides. I know one of the sides was mashed potatoes, the other one was carrots, we had peas with hot sauce, and asparagus. I didn't try the peas because hot sauce of peas just didn't sound appealing to me, but according to the other people in the party, it was good. I always make the mistake of filing up on mashed potatoes because that is my favorite side of all time, and this time was no exception. They literally give you 5 or 6 cuts of meat! It is heaven. Here is the mistake we made and you should definitely try to avoid this if you like your meat medium rare/rare: since the meat comes in cask iron skillets, take out all of the pieces of meat and put them on your regular plates. What happened was that we left the steak in the skillets (rookie mistake, I know) and by the time we got to the last few cuts, it was well done. So the first few cuts we had were absolutely amazing, however, as we got to the better cuts (we saved best for last) they were overcooked :( All in all, still a very good meal. Just when you think you're going to explode, dessert comes out. You seriously want to save room because it is quite the spread. Any dessert you're craving, they will have it. I seriously think they brought out 8 desserts for the 5 of us. They were all spectacular. This place is definitely worth the money but just know that it is not going to be a cheap meal, so save your pennies or walk away from that blackjack table while you're ahead!", "Date": "2012-07-09", "Author_Location": "Yorba Linda, CA"}, {"Author": "Margie S.", "ReviewID": "GP6du_LuiGh0vtq_ssFQFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wowzers, this was one of the best short ribs I have ever had.

When that came out, it was cooked medium rare like we asked. My first bite into the steak, heavenly!! The fattyness of the steak and the flavor was just soo good. 12 oz was a good choice to share. I LOVED the broccolini, delicious and went well with our steak. When we finished our meal, the waiter brought us two chocolate ganache tarts as my complimentary birthday present. Very intense chocolate. Knowing how well everything tasted that night even with the complimentary dessert, I knew I still wanted to order off their dessert menu. \u00a0My husband and I decided to get the chocolate souffle. It was really the best evenly cooked chocolate souffle. Came to table piping hot with the caramel chocolate sauce on the side and chocolate chip ice cream. The souffle was moist and very light but definitely filling. But the end of our meal, the chef came out to see how everything tasted and as part of my birthday gave me a copy of the menu I ordered from for that night. I thought that was a really nice touch.I will definitely add this to my \"to eat again and again\" list when I go back to Vegas. Tom Colicchio did a great job with the concept and the Chef there executed all the dishes in a simple and extremely tasty way.", "Date": "2011-03-13", "Author_Location": "San Marcos, CA"}, {"Author": "Monique W.", "ReviewID": "BSt5FtBrlBLsLCDVZ7oP5Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We came here with our usual group of 8 people.

I was drinking a house Pinot Noir which I started at the bar - $17/glass for Meomi which is a screw top bottle which can be purchased for $17/bottle outside of the restaurant. It was tasty, just surprising that they charge premium prices for a low end wine which doesn't even have a cork!Starters - I had the heirloom tomato salad which was divine, though it was drenched pretty heavily with olive oil. I scraped most of the oil off the tomatoes and thoroughly enjoyed the dish. \u00a0My companion had the cucumber spinach salad which he said was average - nothing special. \u00a0The bread was very good and tasted fresh baked out of the oven.Entrees - I had the filet mignon which was good, but surprisingly not stellar. I like my steaks to have a nicely seared outside with a medium rare center. The sear was not as good as I have had at other steak houses - but then I'm from Texas and we know how to do steaks right here. My companion had the salmon which he said was incredibly average. He regretted not ordering the steak.Sides - All sides were served family-style with large portions for everyone to get their fill. The brussel sprouts were yummy and the risotto was fabulous. In fact, the risotto was the best thing we had. We also ordered the Hen of the Woods mushroom sides since neither of us had tried it before. I enjoyed it but my companion thought the taste was a little strong - I believe the preparation was done well, it was just personal preference. I wish I had tried the mushroom sampler instead but hindsight... \u00a0Service - After appetizer plates were picked up, the new plates which were sat on the table for us were dirty - they actually had dried food on them!!! \u00a0We finally flagged the server and let him know and got new plates. I also sat for some time with an empty wine glass until we could flag our waiter. \u00a0Towards the end of the meal, our waiter just disappeared and then we were being served by another waiter who offered us dessert (we didn't have time or tummy room) and eventually brought us our check. I thought maybe our waiter left or something but I saw him waiting on other tables. Weird. Maybe he was embarrassed about the dirty plate thing?

Hubby and I made reservations for Craftsteak thanks to our fellow Yelpers. We had originally planned to go to Seablue, but the poor reviews for service made us change our mind. 6pm reservation, and we were seated immediately in an almost-empty restaurant. That sort of freaked me out--what Vegas restaurant is nearly desolate on a Wednesday evening? The good part of that was that our food was delivered very promptly...and the food. Oh my God.Bread: Comes out in its own mini baking tray. Six perfect rolls topped with sea salt and served with delicious butter. They were deliciously addictive, and I wish we hadn't eaten so much of it. It really dampened my appetite...Lobster Bisque: Holy caloric explosion, Batman! The bowl is placed in front of you with huge chunks of lobster in the bottom, and then the sous pot filled with the creamiest bisque is poured into the bowl. It was truly amazing. My husband had the Caesar salad with pickled anchovies, and it was perfect--crisp, cold, flavorful and very big for an appetizer. In hindsight, we should have split an app instead of ordering two.Main course: Hubby got the surf and turf. His filet was delectable, but his shrimp were just okay. He liked them fine, but he referred to them as \"nothing to write home about.\" My flat iron steak was perfectly cooked, and so flavorful that I closed my eyes with each bite. It was nearly a religious experience. Sides: We ordered two sides, not knowing that one side would have easily sufficed. Husband got the fingerling potatoes, which were perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. I ordered the sugar snap peas which had just been picked THAT MORNING. They were so delicious--al dente, crisp, sweet and served on some sort of light chili sauce that made the favors pop. Truly amazing.Dessert: Just couldn't. I couldn't even finish my meal, so I wasn't about to go hog wild on dessert.Service: Top notch. We had at least three separate staff working our table, including one woman whose only job was to place our silverware. I want that gig. Everyone was friendly, attentive and congenial. One of the most expensive meals of our young lives, but worth it in every way. And Joe was the bees knees. We'll definitely be back!Tips: Order one side for every two people. Share your appetizers.

Second, I had some of my friend's diver scallops and I tasted a lot of GRIT/SAND as I was chewing the scallop. It didn't help that it also had a fishy smell/flavor. I'm totally doing this out of order, but I also got the frisee salad.. it was definitely too salty and overpowered by the large clumps of goat cheese.

The thought of a juicy wagyu steak was like a foodgasm and the wait was worth it.We thought about doing the tasting menu, but for two people, that seemed like a ridiculous amount of food.

The steak came to the table presliced medium rare with a reduction sauce on top to pair. Without question, the quality of meat was exceptional. It literally melts in your mouth. Chewing, while civilized, is not necessary. The flavor was... disappointing. Given previous experiences with wagyu and especially with the price tag associated, I expected a symphony of taste. Instead, it was a 3-piece orchestra. To be fair, it was a damn good 3-piece orchestra. When observing the cost-taste analysis, I think I would've rather had 2 regular ribeyes.

I had just dined at Michael Mina at the Bellagio the night before, and was on a food high. Unfortunately, that ended after my meal at Craftsteak....underwhelmed would be the best way to describe it.The restaurant is huge, with very little intimate dining space. While I was not on a date, or with my husband, it still made it difficult to chat with the friend I was with. The service was fine, attentive, but every now and then a different server would come by and offer the same thing we had just declined from our own server. Like a car dealerhsip, I felt like they wanted to get a sale so badly that they sent in the closer. Or, they just didn't listen to each other, either way, it was awkward. It was also a little wierd having the server's stand right in the middle of the room. While I was not facing that way, I could still hear all their chatter and the clanking of plates and glassware.The menu is appropraite for the concept, sides are family style, and there are multiple tasting menu choices based on the style of entree you chose. But beware, they start at $119 for a Angus Filet, altho it is supposed to come with multiple sides. We opted for ala carte.I started with the Waygu Tartare. It was good, but not great. In some restaurants they mix the egg in for you, but not here, and because it was in a bowl with crostini's all the way around, mixing was difficult. They also gave me a spoon, rather than a fork. Not optimal for dealing with the dish.Then, since I couldn't make up my mind, I ordered the Surf 'n Turf, cooked mid-rare to medium, and 2 sides; the mixed mushrooms and the white corn grits. The sides were fine, but nothing to get excited about. While they were good sizes had I been sharing, they were a bit big for one person (my freind wanted something else). As for my entree, the filet was cooked to perfection! It was just the right temperature, and my knife cut throught it like butter. On the other hand, the lobster tail was the worst thing I had ever tasted! It was so dried out, I didn't even recognize the texture, absolutely flavorless, and it wasn't served with any clarified butter, which might have helped. Not to mention that it was almost cold. I left it on the plate, and was never even asked about it. We declined dessert.So, as you can see, our experience was okay, just not great. For the price I paid, underwhelmed is not what I was looking for. I paid the same price for the Chef's Tasting menu (with pairings) the night before at Michael Mina and that was amazing, even tho it was slightly less food, it definately left you fulfilled. I would not go back to Craftsteak, and wished that I had spent some of the cost of dinner actually gambling.

Craftsteak was on her list, and I read some pretty awesome reviews so my expectations were pretty high...needless my expectations were never met.SO disappointing. First we made reservations, and I made the reservations. Due to our large group they have a policy (9 or more people) that we'd have to order some sort of set menu that was $110 per person and 18% gratuity is added automatically. Ridiculous...I always think it's the restaurants way of saying we know our waiters/waitresses are being tipped so it's ok to give you crappy service cause we know it's being paid. WELL, to avoid this, I booked up two tables, first, I didn't want everyone to HAVE to pay $110 (Which was close to what we paid anyway), to eat something they might not have choosen, AND I always think tipping should be according to service. I use to be a waitress, I tip accordingly..if it's fantastic 20%, if it's ok 10% etc etc...First we had reservations, but we still had to wait over 30 mins for our table, meanwhile they sat a table of 8 ladies moment before we were supposed to sit down. I had us sitting at a table of 6 and 7....not even an apology was given that they didn't have our table ready...and now we were all sitting together so again they have their 18% gratuity included.Everything was a la carte, which most restaurants like this usually are. I must say the sides I did try and the ones I didn't I heard were great. The asparagus was grilled perfectly. Not too soft, not too crunchy, and the perfect char on them. The mushrooms were awesome, but you can't screw up mushrooms really. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were great, from what I heard. OK - So bf ordered the bison steak, which is what I wanted but since I like to sample lots of things and bf knows he'll be eating half of my meal we decided not to order the same thing. I went with surf and turf..6 ounce filet mignon and half lobster tail. The lobster WAS delicious...the filet wasn't even cooked correctly. I always order medium rare...half of it was medium, and the other half was somewhere between medium and medium rare. I don't think they even SEASONED the steak. It just tasted like a piece of meat..no melting in your mouth, no flavourful bite, nothing. Bf's bison however...that WAS great. Cooked perfectly and accompanied with some delicious red sauce, a little sweetness to it with a little tang, along side another small dip...great. We had some martinis, those were delicious..similar to a chambourg martini, with one more ingredient.Someone else had the braised short ribs, and those were done well..but anything you braise for 24 hours will be fall off the bone delicious. Food was ok, not the best I've had, and certainly didn't live up to it's expectations....It was packed, no doubt due to the name and Tom Colicchio being a judge on Top Chef..but for someone who made reservations two days ahead of time, and they didn't have our tables prepared...without even some complimentary drinks or BREAD for our 35, almost 45 min wait was extrememly disappointing of a five star restaurant...This is a place you pay for service, and we certainly didn't get it...The waiter..he was the only saving grace of this place. He was awesome. I'll never go there again..for a great steak a fraction of the cost I'd even rather go to the Keg...at least they can cook a steak point on each time.....Oh and ps.

Despite what others have said, I actually really liked the atmosphere--casual and loud, with a great vibe throughout the room. We had one really odd experience in which one server introduced himself as part of a duo of servers that would help us, but we never saw him again and his partner did all the rest of the work for our table (I sure hope she got all of the tip!) That minor quibble aside, the service was excellent. The food was generally good, but I have to agree with other reviewers--for what I paid for the meal I expected something much better than Morton's or Ruth's Chris, and what I got was much more like those chains in terms of food quality, but at about twice the price tag. The hanger steak was fine, but it was not worth the nearly $100 I paid for it, especially given that all of the side dishes ran nearly $20 each.

We were so hungry we had to eat it.When our food finally arrived, one and a half hours after ordering, I'm not sure anything short of perfection could have made us happy. I ordered the chicken and smoked paprika tossed French fries. For $36 you get 1/2 of a free range chicken. It was cooked okay, but I make free range chickens at home all the time and they are far more juicy and flavorful. The fries were alright, a bit dry, the smoked paprika was nice.The steaks, ordered by everyone else at the table were proclaimed to be too salty and a bit too charred though well cooked. I had a bite if and end piece and even it was perfect medium rare. They do cut the steaks into slices before you're served, which I don't prefer, but that is what it is.Overall, the atmosphere was stuffy and pretentious. We were treated as though we weren't there to spend a pile of money like everyone else was... And the food was \"okay.\" nothing I'd go back for.We had Witchcraft for lunch and it was fantastic.

Got seated just fine, and the restaurant was not at all crowded. They were also kind enough to split our checks at the end. We had multiple waiters constantly refilling drinks and attending to our needs. The main guy, in telling us about Craftsteak, boasted that they had been \"doing this a long time\" and had \"gotten pretty good at it.\" Initially, I thought it was a little boastful, but boy was he right.A few things you might not be able to pick up from the menu online. You do not have to get the chef's tasting menu. You can order a la carte. The prices for entrees range anywhere from about $40 to in upwards of $100. You don't get any sides with your entree automatically, but the a la carte sides you can order (asparagus, pureed potatoes, roasted potatoes, etc) are huge and served family style. One side could be split among two, even three, people. They start you off, for free, with fresh-out-of-the-oven dinner rolls, lightly covered in butter. They were very good -- not great, like Pearl Dive's bread in D.C. -- but very good. I also ordered the lobster bisque to start. It was amazing. They put a good chunk of lobster in the bottom of a bowl, then pour the piping hot soup on top of it in front of you. I can't convey how good this was.For dinner, I got the ribeye. I'm not a big steak guy, so maybe I don't have a good basis for comparison, but this was hands down the best steak I have ever had. The second place finisher isn't even close. I also tried a friend's short ribs, which I had seen as being well reviewed. They, too, were amazing.For dessert, I had to try the famous monkey bread. Full though I was from the meal, I'm glad I did. Served with a sour cream ice cream, it was just incredible. Probably one of the top five desserts I've ever had (finishes behind the donuts at Graffiato and the pecan pie at Pearl Dive, though). My girlfriend, a vegetarian, just got the tomato soup and ordered roasted potatoes on the side. I have to admit she was disappointed, and trying her soup, I can see why. \u00a0It was pretty bland, nothing like the lobster bisque. That said, I can't not give this place 5 stars. Between my meal and hers, and two glasses of scotch, my total bill, with tax and tip, came out to about $200. You certainly don't have to spend that much if you don't get dessert and soup, but you can easily. That said, it was way worth it.

The only thing that could knock it down would be that it is terribly overpriced. My dinner was comped by the casino so it wasn't a factor for this experience.Before I get started on this $410 dinner for two, I must begin with the service. It was flawless, and I actually mean that literally. We cousin and I watched the \"busboys\" measuring the distance between the chairs while they were preparing the tables for the next guests.I started with a glass of the Malbec. The server gives you a small pour directly from the bottle to makes sure it is up to your standards. I'm glad they do because it was terrible. The waiter suggested a Cabernet in its place. It was excellent (however I would feel badly turning down a second glass anyhow).I started with the lobster bisque. As mentioned in other reviews, I was served a bowl with many large chunks of lobster. The bisque was poured over the meat table side. Best lobster bisque I have had in my life...at $18 it should be. My cousin had the Kobe tartar. It's not my thing, but he said it was excellent. We also shared the sea scallops. Cooked perfectly, and tasted excellent.For the main course, I had the 18 oz rib eye with bone and my cousin had the filet. We really wanted a side of lobster, but they don't offer that so we split the 2.5 pound Maine lobster entree...back to that in a minute. I know this is getting to be redundant, but my steak, order medium rare plus was dead on. I don't know how they did it, but it was perfect. I compare all fine steaks to my favorite, Mastro's. Mastro's is still my number one, but this was a close second...excellent marbling, flavor, aroma. The filet looked great and was well received by my cousin. The lobster is presented shelled, in a light cream and chanterelle sauce. It was good, but they have got to be out of their minds charging $70 for it.The sides were average to above average.

Prior to arriving in Vegas I had made plans with Craftsteak to accomodate our large party. Because there were about 19 of us, we had to make sure that they could even accommodate us since it was a Sat night at prime dinner time and they did, all that was involved was a 6 page contract and a $500 deposit. Just dealing with that part was a pain, hence the -1 star but it is understandable. But when we got there, after a little delay in getting us seated since the people who were sitting at one of the tables we were getting took forever to sign their check and get up, we were seated and the fun began. Shortly after sitting, the hostess apologized for the wait and gave everyone at the table a complimentary shot of a yummy Polish vodka, an awesome way to start the meal. Then all the delicious food started coming out. I had the wine pairing with my meal as well and all of it went perfectly!- First the bread was absolutely amazing. With some butter that just melted into the warm bread served in a skillet, I was in heaven from the start.- Appetizer Course: Shaved Fennel Salad, Shrimp (I believe this was in place of the quail), Buffalo Mozzarella with Red Pepper CaponataPersian Cucumber Salad (all delicious but of course me being the huge seafood lover I am, I adored the shrimp with the juicy shrimp head. Wine Pairing: A very clean and smooth riesling- Main Entree: Prime Beef Flat Iron, Angus Skirt Steak, Diver Sea Scallops- All steak was cooked perfectly, not too well done at all and the scallops were fresh, juicy and divine! Wine Pairing: A red, can't remember what at that point since I shared it with my bro - Sides: Yukon Gold Potato Pur\u00e9e, Saut\u00e9ed Sweet Corn, Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms- All were great. I loved how the potato puree just melted in my mouth and the sweet corn was amazing. - Dessert: Chef's Selection which included an apple crisp, 5 types of sorbet- strawberry and I can't remember the other 4 and other delicious desserts. Wine Pairing- A muscato (my favorite of the 3!)- My special birthday cake: Sent by Michelle A. cuz she couldn't make it with help by Po. An amazing chocolate cake with my fave, strawberries in the middle. Thank you so much you two, so delicious and reading the note made me feel so nice and loved, you guys rock!Service was so on point the entire time. Our server Blue really was extremely accommodating and did everything to make sure we had a great time. \u00a0Thank you to Craftsteak for putting up with us, I know we were definitely on the louder side but we had a blast.

Mr. Hottie arranged the evening all I had to do is show up and look pretty! I arrived in the midst of fighting a migraine. Not good. I wasn't sneered at because I walked in with a bottle of Coke and a bottle of Excedrin as my accessories next to my purse. We were seated immediately. The table we were seated at was an end part of a VERY VERY large booth if you can picture it. So we were facing another party and were almost too close to them. I was hoping for something a little more intimate. We were left to sit for a tad too long. Nothing major, but it was noticed by both of us. I had time to go to the restroom and come back before we were greeted. Our waitress was very nice (and I forgot her name). We started out with a cocktail (glass of Prosecco for me) while we looked over the menu. Our waitress came by to check on us and to suggest that we try the Summer Tasting Menu. She even PROMISED that we would not be disappointed. At first, we thought we would pick one of each offering from each course. Wrong. We got the WHOLE menu! We went with that and added the wine pairings to go along with the courses. Let me list what was on the menu and my thoughts: First Course Shaved Fennel Salad: Zesty and fresh Grilled Quail, Vincotto: Yum, very flavorful Buffalo Mozzarella, Red Pepper Caponata: This was pretty good. Nothing earth shaking Persian Cucumber Salad: I wasn't a huge fan, but it was personal taste more than anything. Main Course: Prime Beef Flatiron: This was my favorite cut of meat served medium rare and full of flavor. Very well seasoned Angus Skirt Steak: WOW another steak! I wasn't as thrilled with this cut, surprisingly. It was still good though. Diver Sea Scallops: Perfectly cooked. The scallops were sweet and firm. Sides: Yukon Gold Potato Puree: Thrilled to have had these. If you want me to be happy. Take a simple dish, and make it WELL. These were so good! Sauteed Sweet Corn: Another winner. The corn was sweet and juicy! Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms: Not a winner. The mushrooms seemed to be overcooked, and rubbery. Dessert: I can't remember what it was, unfortunately. Mind you, I had wine with every course. By the end I was filled to the brim and VERY happy! Since we were the last reservation seating for the evening, we basically shut the restaurant down. Keep in mind, this is a leisurely paced dinner, not a quick bite. Craftsteak was a wonderful experience. Not everything was perfect, but it was very close! I will go back to eat there in a heart beat!

They seated us right away and we were given a menu. We ordered the prosciutto ($14) for appetizer, which was basically a ginormous plate full of proscuitto slices. For some reason I thought it was going to be served with something else, not just plain prosciutto. However, it was the best tasting prosciutto I had in my life, recalling back to the taste of fresh ham from my childhood in Bolivia, though thinner and chewier, and possibly fresher. entree: I ordered the bison ($39), and my bf ordered the kobe flat iron steak ($58, if i remember correctly). The bison was tastier than beef. I chose it because I read it on yelp somewhere that bison is just really good. I thought I'd try it at Tom's restaurant so I could blame him if it sucked. It didn't. It was juicy, tender, lean, and it had a kick to it. My bf's kobe was a hit. He said that it doesn't hit you (how good it is) until you're about to swallow. I'd say the taste and texture of kobe definitely develops as you chew it. Perhaps next time, we can try the wagyu (still have yet to try it).For sides, we got the yukon mashed potatoes ($11), and the asparagus ($11). Next time, I'd just get the mashed potatoes and save myself an extra $11. The asparagus was great, too, but it wasn't to die for like the prosciutto or the mashed potatoes (which also tasted like my childhood mashed potatoes that were made with fresh cow milk and loads of butter).Our server asked us what kind of wine, if any, we would like to pair with our steak. I asked him what went well with bison, since I never had it before. He suggested the pinot noir. I personally like zinfandel with everything so he gave me samples of each to taste (I chose the zinfandel, $17). My bf sampled the merlot and the shiraz and went with the shiraz ($18). The total bill was $204, tax & tip included.the experience? priceless. I'd say this is the best steak house we've gone to so far. The only pet peeve I have is eating a steak that gets colder and colder as you eat. I'm sure there is SOME way to combat that, considering that some steakhouses serve your steak on 500 degree plates or cast iron skillets that are still hot. We told our server that we had a show to catch and we were out by 6:45pm. However, the wait time for our food was about 45 minutes.

I've always wanted to give Tom Collichio's restaurant a try, so me and my co-workers felt it would be a perfect opportunity to give it a try. Our server for the evening was a extremely hospitable and friendly server by the name of Marvin. He checked in on us through out the night, offered some interesting conversation pieces, made sure that our drinks, breads and sides were always topped off, but also gave us space and let us enjoy our food and conversation. \u00a0One note, there are photographers circulating in the restaurant with digital SLR's offering to take your picture but keep in mind, it's gonna cost you 25 bucks if you want to take one home... kinda of a rip if you ask me. \u00a0On to the meal, we all did the kobe style wagyu beef - grade 8 tasting meal which was going to run about 130 a person.The bread came out in a cast iron square pan, with a light sprinkling of kosher salt, with a auburn glowing sheen. \u00a0Each bite was warm, fluffy and had a mild sweetness to it, I probably went after 4 pieces before my dinning companions reminded me that there was an actual meal coming.StartersCaesar salad with anchovy: Tasted like a traditional Caesar salad, I've had plenty of takes on this Caesar, it was good, nothing revolutionary but good nonetheless. \u00a0I did put a nice sized anchovy fillet into a piece of bread I was eating. \u00a0:DBaby artichokes: This was amazing. \u00a0One of my favorite starters of the night, the artichokes were nice and tender, not vinegary at all, and there was a nice light and refreshing dressing that went with it. \u00a0I could have munched on those all night.Watercress salad: The watercress was light and refreshing, some cucumbers and thinly sliced red onions, the dressing was lightly tossed in with it. Let's face it, I came to eat at a steak restaurant, I'm not here for the salad.Grilled Prawns - One of the other starters that came, that again I loved. \u00a0The Prawns were nice and meaty, and buttery. They were succulent, the flesh had a nice sweetness to it. The shells had a nice aroma and a crispiness to it like a cracker. They served it with a dipping sauce, but it was so good, I didn't even use it.Prosciutto - Thin little slices of pork preserved in salt with a heavy marbling of fat. \u00a0We all know how good this is, no need to say more.SidesSauteed White Corn - Saut\u00e9ed, caramelized, buttery corn with a natural sweetness. It wasn't creme of corn but I think with all the butter in it, it came pretty close! \u00a0(No complaints here!) It was awesome!Yukon gold puree with roasted garlic: Really nice creamy puree of Yukon potatoes. Pretty simple. But really damn good.Assortment of mushrooms: I love mushrooms, and this mix included several mushrooms like, hen of the woods, white shimeji, baby shitake &amp; golden chanterelles. Oh my dear lord, if I was a pharaoh I would want to be embalmed with this and be buried forever. \u00a0DinnerNew York: Normally not my favorite cut of meat, but this one was super moist and they had a amazing herbal rub on it, probably one of the best new york cuts I've ever had.Skirt Steak: The only times I've usually had a skirt steak was in fajitas, I was worried this too would be dry and a bit on the tough side, but this skirt steak was absolutely amazing, the sauce was extremely flavorful, I'm glad the chef, picked this cut out for us, I wouldn't have ordered it if I had a choice in it.Ribeye: My favorite cut, with a nice marbling of fat and once again the chef cooked it perfectly, he kept the treatment on this one pretty simple \u00a0salt, pepper and grilling it to a nice medium rare, that's all I need.Dessert:Chocolate semifredo, with warm molten chocolate cakes and brandied cherries: Pretty much everything I love in a dessert was here, the semifredo, was almost like a flan, only extremely chocolatey, I had to have a cup of black coffee with this.Rhubarb Crisp with vanilla gelatto: The rhubarb had a extremely nice sweetness and tartness to it, the warm topping crumble offered a nice difference in texture and of course the most important rule of all, anything a la mode makes it better, this was no exception. \u00a0Sorbet 4 flavors: They gave us 4 house-made sorbets, I liked the pineapple, grapefruit, strawberry and then the grape in that order. \u00a0Nice little pallet cleanser throughout the desert course.Peach Pavlova, creme, fruit, peach ice cream layered on a pistachio macaroon: This had to be one of my favorite desserts for the evening, the macroon, had a nice crumbly texture with the spoon, but the moment it touches the tongue, it melts, giving off the aroma of pistachios. The fresh fruit and the ice cream made of a nice unexpected paring.I only wish we choose our starters I didn't think we needed two salads, and I wanted to try the risotto, but still needless to say, we left stuffed and extremely satisfied. \u00a0Ever wake up with a steak induced hangover? \u00a0We did...", "Date": "2009-11-08", "Author_Location": "Hayward, CA"}, {"Author": "M K.", "ReviewID": "0U1kxIfIwpWaI5ojLkUOYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My friend who goes to Vegas all the time recommended this restaurant to me so I made a reservation. \u00a0We were a party of 7 and we went for the domestic wagyu surf and turf chef selection for 6. \u00a0We really could have gone for 5. \u00a0Our server, Kevin (I think that was his name), was absolutely the BEST! \u00a0He made the experience absolutely memorable! \u00a0After we had picked our sides, he mentioned to us that we had missed the top 2 selections and helped us by making 2 of our sides as half sides to add in the top 2. \u00a0I love it when I get suggestions from the staff because they always know best. \u00a0He was personable, very friendly, and he was a delight to be around. \u00a0You could tell that he really enjoyed being there and was sooooo welcoming. \u00a0Possibly \u00a0one of the best servers that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. \u00a0The steak was absolutely delicious and all of the sides were delicious, especially the grilled corn. \u00a0A lot of steak places have okay sides, but Craftsteak was well balanced with everything tasting fabulous. \u00a0The assorted desserts were delicious as well. \u00a0I really enjoyed this dinner and I loved the sharing aspect!", "Date": "2013-10-09", "Author_Location": "Toronto, Canada"}, {"Author": "Cheri.

Taking our seats we were almost instantly met by Mr. Vallet, a gregarious and friendly man in a great looking grey suit (vastly differing from the black/white clad servers,) who promised us a fantastic meal and confirmed that I did not eat beef while my friends most certainly did. \u00a0Within moments our waters were filled - bottled water without even requesting, and our server and his assistant came to our table to once again confirm likes, dislikes, and anything we may need. \u00a0In order to not belabor service issues too much I will note a couple of issues here that, despite their obviously being overly attentive to our table, were less than impressive. \u00a0First, while Sebastien stopped by multiple times, our server spent vastly more time at a table of well clad businessmen while the assistant served as our primary server throughout. \u00a0While not \"unfriendly\" our assistant's grasp of the English language was poor at best, wines were not described as presented, and this was officially the only restaurant on my trip to Vegas where I had to fill my own water. \u00a0Another service issue presented itself later, but otherwise I have to say the team clearly \"went out of their way\" to please us - yet despite that fact, the service at Mastro's, CUT, Carnevino, and myriad other fine dining establishments vastly outpaced Craftsteak - their \"average\" being better than Craftsteak's \"best.\"Browsing around the restaurant I was amazed at how many hockey jerseys were present - clearly not the \"business casual\" Craftsteak desires. \u00a0Arriving from our assistant server without any description (approximately 1 minute later our main server showed up to tell us what the dishes were) our mains and sides were served with a red wine of which I'm unfamiliar and neither myself nor JT enjoyed - Brad thought it was decent. \u00a0Featuring mains of a 16oz Ribeye, a 12oz Skirt, and Divers Scallops with Fennel and sides of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Sweet Corn, and Wood Roasted Asparagus this is where the other service issue came up. \u00a0As previously noted, I don't eat steak - that doesn't mean my buddies do not eat scallops. \u00a0Featuring only five scallops (we received three of the exact same dish as an appetizer last visit) and my friends each deserving to try at least one I explained to our server that this wasn't acceptable and, surprisingly, met some resistance - apparently my thin frame made him think I can't eat. \u00a0Asking if any other fishes were available I was told only tuna - again the same prep I'd had last year (there was lobster, I saw it on another table, but clearly they weren't giving this away) and inquiring about birds or pork I was told only chicken (I know they had duck and pork loin, I saw the nightly menu) so I requested the chicken. \u00a0Consenting, begrudgingly, the server asked if we wanted anything else and I emphatically stated some mushrooms would be nice. \u00a0While it took about 15 minutes to prepare, the dishes were indeed brought by yet another server - someone who actually smiled (aside from Sebastien.)Myself - I was pleased with the food again, but still less than sold on the service given the fact that they were clearly \"doing their best\" and still seemed a little less than in-step with other restaurants of their caliber. \u00a0When it was all said and done Mr. Vallet stopped by to see how everything had been and I told him it was good - because it was. \u00a0It simply wasn't \"great.\" \u00a0Leaving a nice tip for our service team (perhaps had they known we'd be leaving a good tip the primary server would've been more available) we made our way out of Craftsteak for the last time. \u00a0Impressed enough that I plan to check out Craft the next time I'm in Los Angeles or NYC, Vegas has plenty of other options in the meats market and if I were attending repeats I'd head to CUT or Carnevino first.", "Date": "2009-10-18", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Brandon M.", "ReviewID": "1kb_KDdHKDOEtCSajj3Frg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When you are strolling down the steak isle in vegas wondering where to place a bet for the best restaurant for cow you can feel confident that sliding your chips onto the Craftsteak number is sure thing. \u00a0I am happy to say that I finally found a place that is up there with the Del Frisco experience. \u00a0This is a lot more pricey than Del Frisco's but if you want to branch out from the normal steak in butter and you want more of a \u00a0bedazzled experience you have come to the right place. \u00a0My friends and I did the Wagyu tasting experience and I highly suggest everyone fork out the money to try it. \u00a0We had 3 starters: \u00a0Warm Fris\u00e9e Farm egg, Smoked Bacon dish that was so off the chart I wanted to lick the plate, Hand-cut Wagyu Tartare Crostini that made me so happy I wanted break out some glow sticks and dance in the middle of the restaurant with food ecstasy (which it is vegas and I am sure nobody would have noticed if I did) and the Caesar Salad Pickled Anchovy which was basic and I wish we branched out more. \u00a0The dinner included a Lobster Bisque course that was amazing and presented beautifully.

First off, it took close to 20 minutes after we sat down to order, which we weren't too worried about because we still had over an hour to eat and walk two minutes away to catch Ka. I ordered a lobster bisque, asparagus and the short rib, he ordered the Wagyu skirt steak (as suggested by our waitress). The bisque came out almost immediately and was INCREDIBLE. so good. Scarfed it down and then waited for our entrees. And waited and waited and waited. Close to 45 minutes after the bisque our waitress came back over and told us the food would be out shortly because she knew we had a show to catch, and then walked away- we weren't exactly sure what was going on but she was kind of rushing so we could tell something was up. About an hour after we ordered (when we said we had to leave by) the food shows up. And by this time we knew that we only would have enough time to shovel it into our mouths and run. The food was so wonderful, I was honestly heartbroken to have to leave over half of it on the table so we wouldn't have to miss the show we just paid for. Our waitress came with the food to explain what had happened, I guess there was a glitch in the kitchen and they weren't able to cook for a while, which I totally understand-things happen, not a problem. Then right before we had to leave, the manager came over with two new drinks to take with us to the show as kind of a apology, which we did appreciate. We were just so frustrated that no one came over really to explain anything beforehand, and that we ended up paying over $200 for a meal which we only barely got to enjoy. It was a nice gesture to bring us two fresh drinks on the house, but I didn't go there for the drinks, I went for the food, and I didn't get to eat what I wanted.

Craftsteak at the MGM Grand is a wonderful restaurant. The service is impeccable, the decor nothing short of stunning, and you will, without a doubt have a fine meal here - so long as you are willing to pay the price, and a hefty price it is. The real question is if it's really worth it. Regretfully, my answer is - depends what you're looking for. Craftsteak barely misses the mark in my book; expect to pay more than double what you would at other equally good venues. If we bring the total picture into play, not just food, then our measuring stick has to change and I would give the place 4 stars instead of three. For me, I prefer a beautiful, friendly atmosphere and great food over museum-quality surroundings and average to good food. This review is actually a comparison/contrast and hopefully will give you a good idea what to expect. Our table of three at Craftsteak enjoyed a few drinks then started off with wagyu tartare. It was nothing short of outstanding \u00a0- and an extremely large portion! I was expecting 2-3 oz but received what appeared to be more than 1/2 a pound of pure delight. It was opulent. Had I known, I would have ordered it for dinner and called it a night. The three of us actually struggled to finish it - it is very heavy. On to the steaks. We decided on a 32oz \u00a0rib for two and a 16 oz New York strip. As sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment which included somewhat rare hen of the woods which is a delight in an of itself, and saut\u00e9ed Brussels sprouts. Complaints... well, I must say the steaks lacked seasoning. Sorry, Chef/Owner Colicchio, it was close but no cigar. \u00a0A great steak should need little more than some fresh cracked pepper and salt, our two steaks felt devoid of either. To add insult to injury, the rib was excessively fatty with a rather large grain of connective tissue running through the dead center. This had to be a mistake. The knives provided were surprisingly dull (security issue?) and we had a hell of a time carving through this sucker. \u00a0If not for the great company, I was seriously considering sending it back. We packed up some of the dinner rolls and the remaining steak to make late night sandwiches in our suite that evening- we were feeling like beached whales after the tartare. The check arrived and I handed over $375 to our waiter. Ouch. Double Ouch. I shudder to think what the bill would have been if we ordered deserts and coffee.Lets move ahead 24 hours to a little Irish joint called the \"Nine Fine Irishmen\" at the New York, New York, right over the connecting bridge from the MGM Grand. \u00a0It's a bit loud, but bristling with a friendly, not raucous, energy and live music that was just loud enough that you could still very easily have a conversation. This time it was just myself and my wife. We sat at the deep marble bar (we didn't feel like waiting an hour for a table) and ordered two of the Guinness 250 limited edition stouts. Really yummy (if you like stout). We shared a bowl of their colcannon soup which is a hearty blend of leeks, potato and irish bacon. They offered it to us with fresh soda bread and European butter with a herbs. I was simply in heaven. I considered licking the bowl, but there were too many people, including my wife, watching. \u00a0It was at this point that I started feeling bitter about Craftsteak. My 16 oz NY strip arrived (round two) and horseradish crusted halibut. Perfection! I was enjoying a great beer with a simply phenomenal steak that was cooked to perfection. The halibut was flaky and succulent in every way. Here's the best part - our bill was $64.. Sixty Four dollars compared to what we spent at Craftsteak! ($375). There simply was no comparison. As much as I think Gordon Ramsay is a pompous ass, (and I have eaten at \u00a0his restaurant London), there is something to be said for his philosophy of great, simple food. Craftsteak is good, but with the exception of the tartare, does not blow-me-away. They are missing the mark just a bit by trying to be an over the top. You are paying mostly for a name and a very posh atmosphere. Considering the price and the quality of food, Nine Fine Irishmen was the winner for me. Granted, it's not a somber, fine dining experience, but I enjoy eating out to have a good time and a good meal, not just gawk at the decor and whisper in the amber glow of a restaurant that is bucking for a michelin star.", "Date": "2009-12-07", "Author_Location": "Boca Raton, FL"}, {"Author": "Peter R.", "ReviewID": "_bT6sn7TTFbthvyqFBnOIQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a hard review to score.

I went recently with a friend who shares the same love of food as I do..we literally grilled our poor servers with questions like, \"Okay, seriously..what should we get? Whats the best steak? Best potatoes? Whats your favorite\"After careful consideration, this is what we ate(and if you go..I recommend it all):* I should also note that we shared it all.. including the steak..which was a good call since there were so many things on the menu that looked delicious)-Lobster Bisque- \u00a0really tasty.. not too salty.. nice pieces of lobster.. Creamy but not overly heavy.-Arugula salad- waiter recommended the heirloom tomatoes but since we live in California and get them all the time we chose this. \u00a0Good salad. nothing special but a nice way to break up the heaviness of.......-Domestic Wagyu skirt steak.. \u00a0Amazing. perfectly cooked( we got it medium per the waiters recommendation.. the steak was so tender and marbled it helped keep it together and gave it a nice crust- still very pink inside) The steak had a light sprinkling of sea salt and came already sliced in a jus that was to.die.for.-potato puree- really.. dont even look at the other starch options. Just get this.. trust me it will be the best potatoes you've ever had.-Brentwood corn- I couldn't get enough of this! Someone else's review called it 'crack corn' and I totally agree.-Monkey Bread- Oh yes.. we saved room for dessert and this was worth every bite. In case your not familiar with Monkey Bread( which you can find in the frozen section of Ralphs/vons) Its basically..gooey bread covered with a buttery cinnamon-y caramel sauce.. kinda like a cinnamon roll with out the frosting.. but not really. hmmm.. \u00a0its just good and you should get it! -As for drinks I had 2 glasses of wine.. which the sommelier will gladly pair with you meal.. and my friend had 2 cocktails.

I read one yelper's comments that the beef was melt in your mouth good and I have to say I totally agree. If something other than sex can give you an orgasm...I would have to say, I almost came after my first bite of the Kobe Skirt Steak. I had the Chef Tasting menu - Domestic Wagu Beef for $130 pp. Don't be scared by the price. Unlike some tasting menus which hardly fill you up, theirs has enough food with leftovers. Note that the food is served family style. They usually require the whole party to order the tasting menu but we asked if my girlfriend who was pregnant could order a-la-carte b/c she shouldn't be eating rare beef and let's face it...there is no point in eating a well-done steak. The waiter was very accommodating. Because it was just (2) of us ordering the tasting menu, they only gave us (2) cuts of meat instead of their usual (3). It was not an issue b/c there was so much food. Note: I am a BIG eater. We started off with a salad, scallops and kobe beef tartare. I was very hesitant in eating 100% raw beef but was dying to give it a try. Only Tom Colicchio can pull this off for me. It was very very tasty. We were given the Ribeye and Skirt Steak. Again, it was awesome as I first described and want to keep this review PG rated. It came with several sides. I can't seem to remember what they were since my mind is so set on the steak.

We had a 5:45pm reservation and arrived on time but right at the entrance and there was already a line waiting outside. This made me even more excited to come here. The hostess was really friendly and our server was even better. He was friendly, funny, attentive, and offered amazing suggestions. Since it was our first time there, our server suggested us to go with the three course menu that came with the Maine lobster bisque for each person, 3 smaller salads of your choice to share, 3 side dishes of your choice, the main course of your choice, and 3 desserts. We decided to go with the domestic wagyu. Our server recommended us to get it medium rare because all of the fats would be nicely cooked and worked into the meat that way instead of rare so we decided to have it that way. We also ordered the Glenmorangie wood expressions (Highlands) flight for both of us to taste.The Glenmorangie flight was delicious. You can taste the different oaks in each and it was a nice pour in each of the glasses. The Maine lobster bisque was served initially as an empty bowl so that you can see the herbs and large pieces of lobster and the server pours the hot lobster bisque soup right after. The soup was delicious, light, and creamy. Even better, I really enjoyed the parsley, chives, and large chunks of lobster in the soup which complemented the broth very well. The roasted red peppers salad had a nice soft roasted flavor to it without the char. The peppers were complimented perfectly by the chips of cooked garlic, minced basil, olive oil, pepper, and salt. The wild arugula salad was fresh and crisp and was complimented well by the large piece of shaved pecorino, pine nuts, cracked pepper, and citrus vinaigrette. The warm fris\u00e9e was fresh and crisp and was complimented perfectly by the perfectly poached egg, deliciously smoked bacon, a strong cheese (not sure what it was exactly), and a mustard dressing. My friend and I shared the filet mignon and ribeye and surprisingly we found that we enjoyed the filet mignon more than the ribeye! Don't get me wrong, both were delicious, flavorful, juicy, and so tender that it could be cut with a butter knife. As recommended by our server, the must have out of the side dishes was the potato pur\u00e9e. It had the texture was soft but with bits of harder chunks of potato and the flavor was so heavenly with the buttery roasted savory flavor. This was so delicious I hard time not eating it even though I was horribly full. The mushroom assortment side dish had a nice mix of different earthy tasting mushrooms which was complimented well by the subtle thyme flavor. The Maui onion was sweet and nicely roasted served in halves. It was so hard to eat dessert by then, but even that was amazing. The delicious fruit plate had 4 thin slices of sweet, crisp, and juicy Asian pear, 2 pieces of sweet and juicy Cara Cara orange, and 2 slices of sweet and sour kiwi. The flourless chocolate cake was thick and moist with a rich chocolate flavor. It was complimented by a cr\u00e8me placed beautifully on top of the cake, a few slices of a tangerine, a citrus sauce, and a raspberry sorbet. We were also given two scoops of sorbet. One was blood orange and the other flavor I couldn't put my finger on. Another must have here was the cinnamon monkey bread that tasted like a heavenly cinnamon bun topped with pecans. It was perfectly complimented by a brown sugar sour cream ice cream. My friend and I were so full but we couldn't stop eating it. Overall our experience here was phenomenal! Everything here was amazing.

Why? I almost inevitably end up underwhelmed and disappointed. Typically I find that I can cook a better tasting steak at home, and for a whole lot less. Oftentimes even the high end steakhouses have a surprisingly difficult time delivering a steak that is truly medium-rare. Craftsteak is the exception to that \"rule\".Upon entering the restaurant, you will notice the interior is relatively dark with dim and subdued lighting. The decor is more contemporary and chic than your typical upscale steakhouse.The service is generally warm and attentive without being overbearing. Ordering a la carte can become very expensive so we typically go with their seasonal prix fixe menu which is served family style.Bread service consisted of tasty buttered pan rolls, served piping hot.The appetizers included grilled Vermont farm quail, buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts, shaved fennel, and Persian cucumber with watercress. I enjoyed the first two appetizers. The quail was tender and well seasoned. The latter two were just not my thing, but my dining companions thought they were good.The entrees were Prime flat iron steak, grilled Angus skirt steak, and Diver sea scallops in a lemon vinaigrette. The 2 steaks were properly cooked to medium-rare, as requested, already presliced, and punctuated with fresh sprigs of thyme. While the flat iron was more tender and the skirt steak more flavorful, both were delicious. The scallops were beautifully caramelized on both sides and very satisfying.Sides consisted of a small pot of Yukon gold potato pur\u00e9e with chives, organic baby shiitake mushrooms, and Brentwood sweet corn with green onions. For me, the sides are what often distinguishes a truly great steakhouse from a merely good one, and this is where Craftsteak shines. The potato pur\u00e9e is an impossibly decadent concotion of butter, sour cream, and chives. However, as good as it is, I do prefer my potatoes to have a more solid texture. The shiitake mushrooms were excellent as well but for some reason we only received one small serving to share amongst the five of us. With the exception of receiving an additional small plate of the terrific corn, surprisingly they gave us the very same serving sizes of potato pur\u00e9e and mushrooms as in the past when we dined here as a lone couple. Overall, we felt that they skimped on the sides and would have preferred more sides and a bit less beef.We received 5 desserts of the pasty chef's choice because of the size of our dining party: monkey bread, molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, chocolate panna cotta, peach pavlova, and cheesecake. The monkey bread, topped with cinnamon and nuts and paired with a delicious banana gelato, was my favorite. The molten chocolate cake was nice but could have been a little warmer on the inside. The chocolate panna cotta was a bit too firm but not bad. As for the pavlova, I enjoyed the peach sorbet, but the meringue was a little too thick and hard. The cheesecake was good but not particularly noteworthy.In the past, I've also sampled the Maine lobster bisque which is absolutely divine, albeit pricey ($18).Craftsteak is my favorite steakhouse to date. Why only 4 stars? The value, or lack there of. The food is very good, no doubt, but not worth the expensive prices. During Restaurant Week, the $50.10 seasonal tasting menu is a great deal. Outside of RW, it used to be $60 per person not that long ago, but now it is $85 and they eliminated the grilled organic chicken entree and downgraded from American Kobe to Black Angus and Prime. Now I'm more than willing to shell out for food that is spectacular, but $85 pp is simply not worth it for what you are getting. Sorry Tom, that is just too rich for my blood.

I'll start by saying that I feel that eating a truly well prepared, quality cut of beef is one of the more enjoyable things in life and Craftseak did not disappoint and truly lived up to the hype. We ordered the winter tasting menu for 2 - beet and endive salads, roasted quail in balsamic reduction, kobe flat iron, braised short ribs, jumbo sea scallops, garlic potato puree, and deserts. I went into this expecting small portions. 1st because its a 'tasting' menu and 2nd because its an above-market place where everything is ala carte. I was wrong. This was seriously enough food for like six people and a truly grand, medieval spread fit for kings! I haven't been to the NYC or LA locations, so maybe they serve up bigger portions at the Vegas spot to satisfy the ever expanding waistlines of the rotund, mouth breathing Mid-Westerners in denim shorts and pastel stretch pants that seem to dominate Vegas. Giant women with high rise stonewashed jeans from Old Navy, white sneakers and short haircuts.. The horror.. People like that though would be much more at home with the $9.99 prime rib @ The Flamingo though so who knows. Bottom line: Craftsteak is top drawer; starting with the excellent service from several waiters who do not miss even the smallest detail. The food is spot on - perfectly seasoned, simple yet artfully prepared and presented. Small details like brushing the tops of the dinner rolls with clarified butter & sea salt.. The quail was amazing and some of the most tender and well seasoned fowl I've ever had. The salads and sides were ok but what truly shines here is the beef. The Kobe flat iron was hands down one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. Since my wife is veg-ish and had only the scallops and sides, I had a lot of beef to consume, so by the time desert arrived I felt like I was going to explode. Desert was also incredible. The cinnamon roll they brought was a phenomenal marriage of molten hot cinnamon, sugar and gooey dough. I could go on and on. Its expensive and for two, with wine, one should be ready to drop a few bills, but somehow, its totally worth it.

That awesome Christmas present? The raise at work? The new car?Now think about it, what was the last MEAL that brought you great joy?Mine was Craftsteak.I had the pleasure of dining with three of my closest friends, whom I introduced the thought of Craftsteak to. I had only heard and read about their signature plate, the Japanese Grill Kobe Wagyu Skirt Steak. Today was the day I found out truly what was in store for me. As we toured the menu, it was thought that we were going to order A'la Carte. But in my mind I knew better than that and decided to simply ask, \"What do you recommend we do?\" They suggested that the four of us partake in the Grade 7 Surf and Turf. It was to be a feast that we would not regret. It would take forever to describe each dish, but to have an idea of what to expect:First Course: Parker House Rolls with Flaked Sea Salt and salted butter; Persian Cucumber, Watercress, and Ginger salad; Heirloom Tomatoes with Olive Oil and Basil; Wagyu Beef Tartare with Crostini; Pacific Blue Prawns (a la plancha).Favorite Starter - Wagyu Beef Tartare. The wagyu beef tartare was phenomenal. The seasoning had the right amount of saltiness, and the beef's texture was not fatty or mushy, but soft and delicate. Paired with the crunchiness of the hot crostinis, I would go back just to order this alone. Truly fabulous.Main Course: \"Black label\" Grade 7 Wagyu Beef Filet Mignon, Ribeye, and Skirt Steak; Lobster in saffron butter, grilled asparagus with lemon and thyme, roasted fingerling potatoes with rosemary, assorted mushrooms (hen of the woods, organic baby shiitake, white shimeji, and golden chanterelle).Favorite Entree - Wagyu Skirt Steak. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned and it absolutely explodes flavor into your mouth. Was the ribeye good? Yes, and so was the filet. But those two steaks paled in comparison that the skirt offers. You are doing yourself a disservice if you come here and you don't eat this. Favorite side - Mushrooms - They complimented the steaks beautifully and the assortment was superb. They were not soggy or overcooked and were a perfect side to the steaks. I do hope on trying the Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes next time I am there.Dessert: Sorbet sampler (concord grape, apple cider, melon, and asian pear); Cinnamon monkey bread with pecan toffee and cajeta ice cream; vanilla bean cheesecake with blueberry compote and semolina tuile; chocolate ganache cake with cocoa nib brittle and sweet cream; warm apple fritters with spiced sugar and apple cider caramel; fresh fruit platter (rocky sweet melon, brown turkey figs, and cho juro asian pears).Favorite Dessert - Monkey Bread - The monkey bread was not a dessert that exuded elegance or fine dining in the traditional term. But it was delicious and so comforting, especially after such a robust meal, that for me, it brought back those feelings you have as a kid. Flaky, sweet, with the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. The pecan toffee just knocked it out of the park. I could sit here all day and talk about how delicious the meal was. But it was more than that. Eating at Craftsteak was an absolute privilege and I am so happy that I had the opportunity to eat there, and I'm very much looking forward to it again the next time I'm in Las Vegas.TLDR: Wagyu Beef Tartare was exemplary. Wagyu Skirt Steak blew away the Ribeye and Filet Mignon. Monkey Bread is out of this world. Superb service. Simply put, the Grade 7 Wagyu Surf and Turf was worth every penny and you are doing yourself a disservice by not coming here.

Always done a la carte. I just always think tasting menus have way too much food for me. But on the other hand, the point is to taste what the chef has to offer. So it's just my personal preference to stay away from tasting menus.THE BOOZE: Okay, honestly, I've never had any of their specialty cocktails. Sorry, no dice. However, I can vouch for the friggin' delicious wines they have! Also, I don't really drink Rieslings, but the Riesling that they have by the glass is divine! So if you like Riesling, you must try it. And the best part is, the price by the glass is not that bad at all. I think it was like $9! And generally, the waiter has kind of a heavy hand in pouring. (Remember to tip well! If you can't afford the tip, you can't afford the restaurant)THE BEEF: The first time I ate here, I was frankly not impressed. Everything was over-salted! I didn't want to be harsh. Maybe the person on the grill that evening had a heavy hand. But after repeated visits to Craftsteak, I've realized that every time I get a steak (kobe or not) grilled, it tends to be overly salty. So I've learned that I prefer to get the steaks roasted. The server explained to me that grilled means they just stick it over the grill and flip. Roasted means, they kind of sear it in a pan and then stick the steak into the broiler. Also, it seems when you get the grilled steaks, they slice up the steak for you when they bring it to the table. But when you order roasted steaks, it's the entire steak. Whatever ... I don't care that much as long as it tastes good! I've also had the braised short ribs. That is an excellent alternative to traditional steak. The short ribs were perfectly tender and fell off the bone. THE SIDES/SALADS: Haven't tried a lot of the salads, but I do enjoy the beets or the shaved fennel salads. The ingredients are fresh and good quality. As for sides, I've also learned to tell them to go easy on the salt on the sauteed mushrooms. But I LOVE the assorted mushrooms because they are great quality mushrooms. Also, a great side ... I don't know if it's just seasonal, but the sauteed corn is delish! It's got butter ... and butter ... and more butter! And onion. And just good corn. The Yukon Gold Puree is pretty good - above average, but not amazing like the corn. I would recommend sharing the sides as they are pretty large. The mushrooms could be for two. But the potatoes and corn portions are definitely large enough for more than 2 persons.THE DESSERT: Okay, I admit ... I've found what I like and I've stuck to it. Since many reviewers here recommended the cinnamon monkey bread, that's what I got on my first visit And I've never veered. So I suggest you get it too. BOTTOM LINE: The service is excellent and the food is great, if you order the right things. One of the nicest waiters there is an older gentleman from Switzerland or something around there.

The dessert was some kind of chocolate cake and a selection of sorbets (one of which was red bull flavored. \u00a0Seriously? \u00a0Red bull is nasty, it's flavor only slightly improved by vodka) \u00a0The wine paired with the steak was good. \u00a0The other two were unremarkable, and the dessert wine they paired with the chocolate cake was some kind of Sauternes, which I consider to be an inappropriate choice for chocolate. \u00a0A late harvest Zin, port, or some sherry would have been much better. \u00a0As you've probably gathered I was completely unimpressed. \u00a0I'm not the type to complain to management about such things, which is why I'm venting to you all here. \u00a0(thank you yelp) \u00a0When I pay top dollar for a tasting menu I expect something really special, high quality and creative. \u00a0This was none of the above. \u00a0I felt seriously ripped off and pist off when leaving this place and the feelings have not subsided. \u00a0If Tom had been judging this meal I think he would agree. \u00a0He needs to go check on the people running this place because they're ruining his good name. \u00a0If you're looking for a interesting and delicious tasting menu from one of the excellent Chefs in Vegas, choose someone else!", "Date": "2007-12-13", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Fay I.", "ReviewID": "zVmZ9mCN0DAZV9mau2zm-Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So it was my first time coming to Las Vegas, And I heard from many friends that the food is a plus out there.

It was expensive! Restaurant was packed, we had reservations for 9:30pm. Those without reservations had to eat at the bar. Lighting was dim, but I didn't mind. We were seated in a booth in the back, but once again I didn't mind because the place was completely full for the night. It was CES week after all...We didn't have breakfast or lunch that day. We snacked on a berry danish and smoothie from Jean Philippe in the afternoon so we could eat like pigs at night. ;)We ordered a few martini's and they were quite good. At $13 each, it's quite reasonable/cheap because 1) it's Vegas, 2) well made, 3) quite strong, 4) compared to drinks @ Sushi Samba, these were spectacular!We settled on the wagyu's chef tasting menu $130pp.I read a ton of reviews before I came here and heard how good the rolls were. They're just rolls, how good could they possibly be?? OMG! The dinner rolls were light and airy, came out warm and had just a touch of salt. I could've eaten a ton, but I didn't. We should've taken some to go, and made wagyu sandwiches with them.. =D4 Apps: Watercress and Cucumber Salad: really quite refreshing, yet very simple.Buffalo mozzarella: really liked this. I don't like cheese in general but the mozzarella was so creamy and with a touch of balsamic vinegar, it was delish!Hawaiian Prawns - seriously these were probably the best prawns I've ever had. Tons of flavor, thank goodness for the dim lighting because we sucked on the heads like Anthony Bourdain says it really is the best part. Prosciutto with Pear Chutney: nothing special.Main: Wagyu skirt steak: my friend loves ribeye because of the fat content but he said the skirt steak was actually better then the ribeye... It was quite flavorful and charred just a bit on the edges.Wagyu ribeye: it was good, even better the next day. Sides:Wild mushroom medley: delicious though a little bit too salty for meCreamed Yukon Gold Potatoes: creamiest mashed potatoes with so much butter.. I would never put this much cream/butter in my own potatoes, but they were so....good.Asparagus: grilled, something you can make at home, but goodI probably only had a slice each of the ribeye and the skirt steak because I was mainly concentrating on the sides. I don't really like steak, so my friend was eating most of the meat. Thank goodness we didn't have lunch that day because we were so full. We took what was left of the steak to go and we still had dessert coming up. For dessert we were brought out: Dark Chocolate \u00a0Molten Cake, an assortment of Sorbet, Cherry Cobbler and some Grilled Pineapple. We didn't really care for any of them. So 1 star off for that. I've had way better molten cake, but I live in nyc; we have good food whether it's cheap or expensive. The grilled pineapple - really? who would pay for that? Sorbet was okay but I had better just the other night at the Venetian. Maybe a lil too icy and not enough fruit. I don't really think cherry cobbler belongs in an upscale restaurant. I want something richer or fancier, not something I could get at a diner. We took the desserts back to hotel as well.We spent a little over $400 since we had 6 drinks between the 2 of us.

Beautiful place, fantastic service, definitely hats off to the chef. My boyfriend bought tickets for KA right in MGM near Craftsteak, and they asked us if we'd like to throw in a 3 course meal at Craftsteak for $50/person, which was supposed to be $100/person, damn was it worth it. \u00a0The place doesn't even need to use butter or tons of oil for every dish to make it extremely good, like many other places. I mean, who can't cook well if they're throwing a stick of butter in everything? They didn't even need too much sauce or anything, they had the distinct flavors cooked into each and every bite. The chef's got skill- believe me! When we went, we expected to be given just 3 different dishes per person, which we choose out of a few choices for each course. Instead, they just gave us the whole chef's taster! And it wasn't like every dish was the size of my palm like most expensive places - some were small, but some were large, and we had plenty to take home. It was definitely enough to feed 4. These were the dishes we got:Appetizer:bread - they make it themselves, and they give you 2 kinds! yummmSalad - this was just plain salad with watered down dressing :p the only dish which wasn't superb. But as if you were gonna come here just for salad!Quail - soooo delicious. Tasted like really good steak, yet it was quail!Roasted Red peppers - Considering it was just red pepper slices, it was surprisingly good.Main Course:Diver Scallops - so buttery and fresh you'd never guess you were in a desert.Free range Chicken - \u00a0Kind of bland. Okay fine the other dish that wasn't superb.Hangar Steak - thin, salty, peppery crust on the outside, cooked medium rare on the inside. The BEST dish, alongside the quailSide dishes:Yukon Puree - THE most buttery mashed potatoes you'll ever find! There was actually melted butter floating on top of the whole dish. It was so pureed it was like a heavy cream.Braised Asparagus - I've never tasted asparagus that I couldn't stop \u00a0eating. It was almost melt-in-my mouth good - cooked for the perfect amount of time, it was neither soggy or hard.Baby shiitake mushrooms - These were SO delicious. They didn't have that aftertaste shiitake mushrooms have, nor that chewy texture. \u00a0I could literally eat a huge platter full of just these lil mushrooms. Dessert:OMG they gave us 4 ice cream scoops, each a different flavor: Butter Pecan, Chocolate, Strawberry Sorbet, Kiwi Sorbet. All made from scratch.French Vanilla Cheesecake: THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!!!! You HAVE to order this. It was straight melt-in-your-mouth, SO-damn -creamy, SO rich you'd think you wouldn't be able to swallow it, vanilla bean-y and yet, not so sweet like cheap bakeries make it that it hurts your throat. If you don't order this, you're missing out. My mouth's DROOLING from thinking about it! Seriously.Fingerling Donut: rich, buttery, flaky pastry that has its own dipping sauce, which is incredibly tasty. It tasted like a donut, but denser, richer, and more buttery.Fresh Fruit: sliced strawberries and pineapples. Even their fruit was the perfect amount of ripeness and sweetness!You've got to eat here.

and they actually had plump limes as the lime juice really brings all the flavors together into one cohesive taste for your palate.During dinner I had a classic gin martini, Tanqueray No. 10 was used. \u00a0The Tanqueray No. 10 has a more full rolling flavor rather than the regular Tanqueray that, I feel hits with a hard sharp punch. \u00a0The martini was mixed well. \u00a0The girlfriend had their

radishes with a thai lime vinaigrette. \u00a0Peppery with the mild earthiness of the radish and wrapping it together with the sourness from the lime in the vinaigrette.Spinach salad with sliced red onions, sliced cucumbers, with a bleu cheese vinaigrette.Buffalo mozzarella drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, topped with diced tomatoes, roasted macadamia nuts and garnished with some toasted fennel.Grilled Hawaiian prawns. \u00a0This was really good, lemon and cocktail sauce on the side. \u00a0Don't forget to suck those heads.Mains:Domestic wagyu 10oz filet mignon and domestic wagyu 12oz skirt steak. \u00a0Cooked slightly under medium-rare. \u00a0Both cuts had very good marbling, flavored perfectly and cooked how I like it. \u00a0Very very tasty!Sides:Yukon gold puree, mushroom assortmet (four types), sauteed baby broccoli. \u00a0All were really good. \u00a0The potato puree would be the highlight for the sides as they were rich and creamy and a nice surprising twist to the normal mashed potatoes. \u00a0Desserts:Roasted pineappleIt was good, but didn't really do anything for meSorbets, Orange basil, the orange and basil really mixed well, unfortunately being so full, the basil was a little more pungent than I would have liked. \u00a0Second sorbet, Cabernet Concord grape, this was great the grape flavor was not too tangy and mixed well with the Cabernet.Chocolate ganash cake with sweet cream. \u00a0I really liked this, dark chocolate, not too sweet, the addition of the sweet cream on the side made it perfect. \u00a0Nice warm oozing chocolate center mixed with cake and topped with sweet cream.Pear cranberry crumble topped with a scoop of ginger iced cream. \u00a0Good texture in the crumble and flavor mixed with the sweetness of the pear followed by a very slight tang from the cranberry. \u00a0The ginger iced cream hits you with a medium sharp ginger flavor then mellows out as it melds with the flavor of the pear. \u00a0Works great.This was a very tasty meal. \u00a0There was enough food to feed another person. \u00a0They even packed it up for us to go. \u00a0Not only did they pack up the food, they gave us another glass to

She said it was like the best meal she ever had, and I completely agree with her. We made late reservations after a show, we got there earlier than expected but the staff was more than accommodating. They seated us way before our reservation time. The ambiance of the restaurant was so inviting, it would have been great for a large group of people celebrating and a more intimate date type situation. We chose to do the chef's menu. There were just way too many selection and this way was easier. For the chef's menu you choose from I think three types of meat, the angus beef, the domestic wagyu, and a surf and turf. The prices are set accordingly, 115, 140, and 160 respectively. Since everything is shared, you can't choose an option different from your table. (Maybe a bigger group can, but it was just me and my BF and we had to choose the same type of meat) We let the chef choose what cuts to give us and how to prepare, you can't go wrong there. They also gave us the option of choosing what sides we wanted, or just have the chef choose what he thought would go best with the main dishes. We let the chef choose and loved everything. The roasted red bell peppers with garlic was my favorite. The wagyu beef tartare was freakin amazing!! There was also a plate of various types of mushrooms, you'd love it if you're a mushroom fan. The potato puree was delicious, buttery and creamy. There was also grilled prawns, an arugala salad, and roasted corn....all were delish. Even the complimentary dinner rolls were awesome!!! They came in the baking dish they were made in and were sprinkled with sea salt. There was soooo much food, even big eaters like me and the BF had trouble finishing everything.

Boy oh boy did craftsteak deliver! From the moment the hostess greeted us until we left, service was top notch. We started with amazing cocktails and nibbled on the most tender dinner rolls that had just the perfect amount of salt on top. However, I knew better than to stuff myself with bread - a fine assortment of delicacies awaited us. \u00a0We had a wide variety of appetizers including: baby artichokes, buffalo mozzarella, Caesar salad (even the anchovies were deelish), grilled quail, frisee salad with bacon and Gorgonzola, the charcuterie sampler and last but most definitely not least, the Wagyu beef tartare. My taste buds swooned with each bite. Was it possible that each item got better and better? How would I make it through the meal? I'd have to say that the charcuterie sampler (served with some of the most amazing mustards I have ever had, including one made with red currants) and the Wagyu beef tartare were simply divine. Whew - I have to take a breather, I'm salivating just thinking about this meal again. For our main entrees we ordered skirt steak (well done) and the filet mignon and scallop surf and turf (rare.) Allow me to preface this by saying that I like my meat very very rare - I like to hear a faint moo as I chew. But since we were sharing the dish we compromised on the how well-done the steaks would be. Oh my! The skirt steak was amazing. It had a slightly crunchy and salty outer layer and was so tender and flavorful inside. The scallops were ginormous and were sweet and tender and tasted just like a scallop should. They were not smothered in a sauce nor were they overly seasoned. The filet mignon was heaven. I had forgotten what real beef tasted like. It melted in my mouth. It was perfect. For our sides we thoroughly enjoyed: sauteed broccoli, Yukon gold puree, chanterelles and mushroom risotto. The broccoli was cooked perfectly, it had a nice bite. I am constantly amazed at how many restaurants cannot prepare the simplest foods. The Yukon gold puree was like velvet. The chanterelles bursted with flavor and last but definitely not least the mushroom risotto. What a symphony! The risotto was spectacular. It was topped with an assortment of sauteed mushrooms that had a slightly crispy texture which played nicely with the creaminess of the risotto. Each grain was cooked to perfection - no gumminess or uncooked surprises.Food this flavorful does not need elaborate preparation. The freshness and quality of the food was apparent. The chefs clearly demand quality from their farmers and ranchers. I was pleased to learn that the majority of the food was grown in California, which isn't exactly local, but c'mon, Vegas is the desert, not going to expect a whole lot of truly local produce.Oh wait, I almost forgot, dessert. Most steakhouses tend to fall short on their dessert offerings; however, this was not the case with craftsteak. We ravished the cinnamon sugar doughnut holes that were served with an orgasmic Meyer lemon mousse and huckleberry preserve. The sorbets and ice creams (pear, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla bean, espresso and cherry and chocolate flake) were bursting with flavor and weren't overly sweet. The dark chocolate lava cake had a lot of rich cocoa without being too heavy. Perhaps the best part were the cookies. Crispy pecan praline cookies were served with a decadent butterscotch mousse. We broke the cookies and dipped them into the mousse.

Compared to other steakhouses in Vegas (e.g. SW, Cut) this place really does hold its ground! Yes, I did spend about $600 for two (W/O including alcohol) at the MGM Grand of all places, LOL. But let me tell you, Craftsteak is very special at any price. To start, there was just the two of us. We both ordered the 3 course 'A5' Japanese Wagyu and shared a side of potato puree, mushrooms, and asparagus. It was definitely A LOT of food! ... And I should mention that although we ordered separately, we decided to share and eat family style since we both want the rib-eye and the strip (more on this later.)---Appetizer+ Wagyu beef tartare+ Braised artichokes + Grilled quail \u00a0 \u00a0The artichokes and quail were okay. But the tartare was very good. It was topped with a raw quail egg and you get chips to eat it with. I've had tuna tartare and beef carpaccio before, but not beef tartare. It was definitely a treat.---Entree+ 'A5' Wagyu Ribeye+ 'A5' Wagyu StripAMAZING on every level. By virtue of it being genuine kobe beef, I would say that 75% of the work was already done for them. But considering the delicate nature of this meat, I think the chefs did a masterful job in their preparation. The meat was cooked to perfection and I love how they use rosemary on their skillet presentation. Quite honestly, it was very difficult to differentiate between the ribeye and the strip because both were extremely, EXTREMELY rich in texture, taste, and.. oh soo tender. They were also very generous with their cuts. I never really checked how much we were supposed to get, but I think both the ribeye and the strip was 10 oz ea.? Trust me, for kobe beef that's A LOT!! And on a separate note, maybe because we decided to share our meals, but the steaks were pre-cut for us. Sides+ Potato Puree+ Mushrooms+ AsparagusMushrooms and asparagus were okay. But the potato puree was REALLY good! I don't really know how to explain it.. it's like mashed potatoes in a miniature cast-iron kettle.. it's very delicate, tasty, and soft? ---Dessert+ I don't really care too much for dessert, but we got 2 cakes and a sherbet. It was good. But I was already stuffed.. so I didn't take more than 2 small bites of each. + Their french pressed coffee was really good though. I should have asked what kind of beans they used..---Drinks+ We had a glass of wine that the server recommended.. it was good, but I have an untrained palette for wine, so I wouldn't know any better+ Their flavored martinis were good---Decor: Contemporary, warm, inviting.. without the over-the-top glitz and glamor associated with Vegas fine dining (e.g. Joel Robuchon.) And surprisingly casual?Service: Was excellent! Our server was really, REALLY good. But then again, I think we were one of the easier patrons to serve that night..Overall, I think Collichio did a marvelous job with this one. If you're looking for a fancy steak house, this is THE place to go in Vegas. I know there's a lot of options out there, and the location at the MGM is a little far from the center of the Strip, but I think it's worth it; especially if you're planning on watching KA or an event at the Grand Arena.", "Date": "2010-05-20", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Mary P.", "ReviewID": "udS-ErL5QMePV9dj9D0esA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A waste of time and money. \u00a0Ordered the Porterhouse medium rare, it arrived cold and super rare. \u00a0Waiter chatting incessantly through out the meal, hard to enjoy the company we were with. \u00a0A poor reflection on the owner of this restaurant, as I am sure most people go there because of the owner.

I tried to resist the bread since I didn't want to fill my stomach all awhile he was eating 3 already, not to mention we ordered extra bread to-go!!

The lobster came in a mini copper pot in which i believe there were 2 lobsters cut into easy to eat chunks soaking in a buttery sauce. The pureed potatoes were so creamy and delicate tasting. Usually if you were to mash or puree the potatoes too much it will become pasty and gummy but they got the science right on making the perfect \"pureed\" potatoes! I would love to eat this if i got my wisdom tooth out was the first thought in my head. LOL The grilled maui onions were perfect compliment to the meal. Maui onions are sweet.

I feel that I might be a bit picky, but it's only because I was expecting to be completely blown away. Granted, my experience was great and my partner and I really enjoyed ourselves, but there were a few little things which irked me the wrong way. Full disclosure, our visit was December 8, 2012; just being clear that I didn't JUST visit. Anyway, moving on...My partner and I had a very early dinner reservation, owing to it being a) a Saturday night, b) the weekend smack-dab in the middle of the National Rodeo Finals, and c) the same night as the Pacquiao/Marquez fight. Needless to say, it was packed. In the end, we were glad for the early reservation because it allowed us plenty of time to eat our meal without feeling rushed for our show later that evening. When we first walked by the \"outside\" (I put it in quotes because nothing in Vegas has a real exterior unless it's a casino), I was worried it was going to be tiny. What I saw from outside, though, was merely the bar/lounge. Once inside, the place is huge. The decor and lighting is very smart and even though the tables are placed quite close to one another, you still feel you can have a nice conversation with whoever is with you.My partner and I began the evening with a sampling of their fresh oysters. Presented with a red wine minuet, freshly grated horseradish, and (if I recall correctly) house-made cocktail sauce. Oysters were incredibly fresh and flavorful. We then each had a salad: the Caesar and the Arugula. Both were delicious, but they were both HUGE. I swear there was at least half a box of arugula in my salad bowl. I ended up leaving much of the salad behind, as I was afraid of filling up before my steak arrived. Ah, the steaks... This is where I think Craftsteak really excelled (and good thing, too, given the name). I ordered the Petite Fillet. Although far from petite at 10 oz, it was a lovely and tender cut of beef and roasted to perfection. It was neither too rare or overdone, which is difficult with a steak as thick as fillet tends to be. It really did melt in my mouth. The presentation with a roasted shallot was just right. My partner went with the 10 oz Hangar steak. His steak was also cooked to perfection and was absolutely delicious. We shared two sides: Heirloom Cauliflower with Garlic Confit and French Fries with Roasted Paprika and Sherry Vinegar. The sides were excellent, as well, the french fries, in particular, being the star of the table: perfectly cooked and spicy and savory from the roasted paprika and vinegar. I felt the cauliflower, while still delicious, seemed too rich. We ended our meal simply with 2 scoops of ice cream: 1 mint chocolate chip and 1 vanilla bean, both house-made. The vanilla bean ice cream was incredibly creamy and rich, without being too sweet. The mint chocolate chip, on the other hand, was disappointing. Instead of peppermint, fresh spearmint was used for the mint cream, instead, giving it a weedy aftertaste (imagine chewing on a leaf of fresh mint for too long). We did enjoy our dessert, even if it didn't really live up as much to the rest of the meal. As for drinks, my partner and I both ordered martinis: 1 with Junipero Gin and olives, the other Grey Goose with a twist. It should be noted that both martinis came with olives, even though one was specified to come with a twist. My partner did not send his back, though. The martinis were generous to say the least. The \"extra\" was provided on the side in a tiny individual shaker and after the refill ended up being the equivalent to 2 full martinis. The wine list is extensive and also INCREDIBLY expensive. There was no note of a corkage fee, but even if it's the more standard $25, it's worth it to bring your own bottle. There were only 2 or 3 full-sized bottles priced less than $80, with the majority of the list above $100. Stick with cocktails or bring your own, unless you want to pay handily for wines you can find at Bevmo for half their menu price. Nonetheless, we found a fine bottle of California Pinot Noir for our meal.So, here comes the nit-picky part. Perhaps due to the packed house they had that night, our waiter frequently changed. It seemed there was staff members everywhere, running this way and that. It was a little distracting. The waiter who greeted us when we first sat down, was not the waiter who handed our check in the end. There was no hand-off done and no introduction to our new waitress. Instead, it changed and that was that. Overall, the portions could be scaled down a bit. I simply cannot eat 10 ounces of meat, which is the smallest steak size they offer, and since we were merely visiting, I couldn't take the leftovers to go. I know Vegas is all about \"go big or go home,\" but I hate wasting food, too.Overall, though, a great experience. We're happy we came.

Interior and setting, etc. The waiter was great at the start, but after his first check-in after we got our main courses he sort of disappeared. When we ordered wine I told them who would be drinking it, but the wait staff (not our main waiter) still went to each and every person asking if they wanted wine, each of them needing to decline. And... hey it's not a big deal but it made for a somewhat awkward situation. Considering experiences at similar style restaurants, of similar reputation, I just would've expected a more attentive staff. At another point people's glasses had near emptied and I began to refill them. A server rushed over and actually wrestled the bottle from my hand mid-pour. It was bizarre.The real issues, unfortunately, came with the food. Started with the Lobster Bisque which was ok. The Lobster was overdone and tough, but the soup itself was quite nice. I think the whole herbs they throw in are a bit much, they kind of stuck to my teeth as I was trying to enjoy a rather luxurious and pure soup.On to the steaks! I had the New York, which, hey it's a standard New York strip and so I don't expect anything insane, but it was cold when it arrived and just wasn't as good as I would have expected. My girlfriend got the rather pricey Wagyu skirt on recommendation of the waiter as the best steak they have. It came rarer than ordered, and I tried a couple pieces, it just was not a great piece of beef. Luckily she liked the mashed potatoes. By contrast a nice but local hole in the wall near our home is one of her favorite steaks, also a skirt!, and for about a third of the price. I was ok with my steak, but she was just really sad about hers. I don't really care about me, but her not enjoying a meal breaks my heart.Later on that night and the next day a lot of people were saying, \"But their side items are so awesome!\" And so we were joking for a while that it should be called Craftsides, but honestly ... the sides just weren't that good. The Robuchon style mash, sure, anything with that much butter is going to be good, but then I tried the orange colored, gloppy, Elmers glue-infused risotto. Amazingly it was the worst risotto I've had in my entire life. I was blown away how bad it was. All the other sides were good, but you know, pretty standard stuff.It was a Sunday, it wasn't very busy, but the waiter never really came back (although he was great while he was there!), and when someone came to clear our plates a server asked if my girlfriend was done with her steak, and with 90% of the steak intact I sort of leaned in and said \"She didn't really like it...\" and he said ok and walked away with it. I didn't really care to cause a fuss in front of our group of friends, but at that point he really should have let our waiter know. I could have been forceful and really demanded her steak and the embarrassing risotto be stricken from the record, but we just wanted to leave and forget about it and go out and have fun. I wish I had said something now, of course, being a few hundred dollars poorer and nothing good to show for it, but anyway... Luckily we had good friends with us and we still had a good night.I unfortunately can't recommend this restaurant to anyone.", "Date": "2013-02-01", "Author_Location": "Irvine, CA"}, {"Author": "Chad M.", "ReviewID": "ezgNfvGM_JzR_t3L0PwMtw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been here for dinner two times.

For the cut of meat, we chose the A5 Wagyu filet only.We also added the lobster bisque which is an absolute must. Large chunks of lobster and a fantastic creamy taste.We then had the tartar which was fantastic as well. Tasted extremely fresh. I could eat a pound. We then got our steaks. Bottom line, the best steak I've had and I've had steak in many steakhouses, including in Kobe. Melts in your mouth and has a lot of taste. If you don't like the taste of fat, the standard filet might actually taste better to you. I highly recommend the filet A5. The sides were mostly great. The mashed/purred potatoes were amazing and the other potato sides were very good to great. While you're eating the steak though, nothing really tastes close. For dessert we got the monkey bread, sorbet, pineapple in a cinnamon sauce, and a couple it her items. Bottom line the monkey bread is the only thing we should have gotten. Everything else except the horrible passion fruit sorbet (which my friend rightly said tasted like fish. Lol) Monkey bread is my favorite dessert. The meal, suffice it to say, was not cheap.

I'm pretty sure that's a cardinal sin in the world of steak. \u00a0It causes the meat to loose all its juices into the plate before you're even served. \u00a0Third, we had to ask the server for the salt and pepper. \u00a0A little pretentious but no big deal. \u00a0Fourth, this is a fantastic restaurant, but not a true steakhouse (see below). \u00a0Lastly, not all the steaks are prime, and at $40+ per steak, I find that hard to swallow (yes!!! pun intended). \u00a0The food was overall exceptional. \u00a0Appetizers. \u00a0We started with the fresh buffalo mozzarella, which was served with a drizzle of oil and I'm pretty a house balsamic vinagraitte, that had a little more texture than you're regular balsamic. \u00a0The mozarella was accompanied by a sort of tomato relish and crumbled cashews (I think), and was absolutely delicious. Lots of flavor and texture, would definitely order again. \u00a0Bread. \u00a0I know, who does a review for the bread??? \u00a0Well, in my worthless opinion, any staple of a good steakhouse is their bread/rolls. \u00a0Craftsteak did not disappoint. \u00a0We were served a small cast-iron pan containing 6 homemade parkerhouse rolls, seasoned with a little butter and sea salt. \u00a0It's almost worth skipping the appetizers and chowing down on some bread while waiting for the steaks. \u00a0Entrees. \u00a0Had to order steaks. \u00a0I ordered the hangar steak, medium-rare, and it was perfectly cooked. \u00a0I can't recall the last time I saw a hangar steak available on any steakhouse menu, and it was fantastic. \u00a0The cut of meet itself has plenty of texture without being overly difficult to chew, lots of flavor, very close in flavor to a ribeye, yet it looks like it was physically ripped from the cow \u00a0and placed in your plate, not a pretty cut, very masculine and satisfying to my caveman ego. \u00a0My girlfriend ordered the flat-iron steak, and it was also exceptional. \u00a0I think they marinated the flat-iron, but whatever they did it was phenomenal. \u00a0It almost tasted like some light soy sauce-based marinade. \u00a0Who knows, I could be wrong, but they definitely churched it up. \u00a0Sides. \u00a0We ordered the yukon gold puree, and it was awesome, would go great with any steak on the menu. \u00a0We also ordered the sauteed baby spinach, and it was, well, spinach, nothing special here. \u00a0Wine. \u00a0Phenomenal wine selection. \u00a0And by that I mean large (2300 choices, according to the menu), but seeing as how I wasn't going to spend $100 on a bottle, it was dissapointing to see that they only had about a dozen or so wine-by-the-glass selections (approx. 12 red and 12 white). \u00a0Dessert. \u00a0We shared the cinammon monkey bread, it was served with banana ice cream and crumbled walnuts, and it was freaking delicious. \u00a0Service. \u00a0We had some great service, absolutely no complaints in this department. \u00a0Seating. \u00a0The seating was a little odd. \u00a0We sat toward the front of the restaurant, on a couch with two small tables pulled up to it. \u00a0My girlfriend and I were on one end, and another party of two was on the other end. \u00a0It was a very loud location, with a lot of activity (we were basically sitting within a midget's throw of the bar). \u00a0They open these doors that essentially pour out into the busy and loud MGM corridor of shops and restaurants. \u00a0I would suggest asking for a table toward the back of the restaurant if you want a more intimate dining experience. \u00a0Price. \u00a0$200 for two ($230 if you include the cocktails). \u00a0I am all for paying top dollar for a great meal, but I felt that a few things were lacking quality wise and didn't justify the hefty price tag. \u00a0Primarily, I was really disappointed that the steaks weren't all prime-aged meats. \u00a0I don't think you can call yourself a steakhouse unless you have prime beef. \u00a0In Sum. \u00a0This was a very good meal. \u00a0The appetizer, steaks, puree, and dessert really blew out socks off, and made for a memorable meal. \u00a0However, a few things need to be discussed. \u00a0First, the lack of prime meats was sorely missed, and I don't think anything less than prime is worth $40+ per person. \u00a0Second, the steaks were delicious, but imagine how good they COULD be had they not been cut into pieces before getting to our plates?? \u00a0Lastly, this is a terrific restaurant, but not a true steakhouse.", "Date": "2010-04-26", "Author_Location": "Aliso Viejo, CA"}, {"Author": "Cassandra D.", "ReviewID": "yRGMRzSyd8W-SYZr5Me8Qg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had gone here for my 21st Birthday dinner!

Third, they overcooked the steak, or maybe it was sitting on the counter for so long that the steak kept cooking and also became cold at the same time..who knows, either way the steaks came out medium and medium-well, when we asked for medium-rare. \u00a0 \u00a0 We told the waiter about our unsatisfied steaks, and he took our steaks back and had them recook it without questions! \u00a0A+ on the waiter's part for taking back our steaks NO QUESTIONS ASKED...unfortunately he tried to double charge us on our bill! \u00a0 \u00a0 We also ordered sides of mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and sauteed brocolli. \u00a0The mashed potatoes were very good! \u00a0The mushrooms and broccoli were way too salty! \u00a0Our t-bone steak came out okay, but i felt like the meat was a little bit tough and didnt have much flavor...then again I hardly eat t-bone. \u00a0So we waited and waited for our two steaks to come back, the waiter swung by a couple times to tell us our steaks would be here shortly..but it took almost 25min for our steaks to come back..way too long in my opinion! \u00a0Finally our steaks came back, but this time the steaks were way too rare! \u00a0The waiter tells us he cooked it rare+ (which is somewhere between medium-rare and rare). \u00a0But, we didnt ask for rare+, we asked for medium rare...the rare+ was raw on the inside, it looked almost rare, and the inside was not even cooked (it was cold). \u00a0 Of \u00a0course, at this point we were dissapointed and didnt want to tell the waiter to take it back again (it might have taken another 20min of our time). \u00a0 We decided to eat the side pieces of the meat and avoid the rare parts..the ribeye was actually a good piece of meat, but its hard to eat rare meat. \u00a0 The new york was a little chewy, but that could be because it was undercooked! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Another thing to add to our experience here was the waiter kept dissapearing on us, we waited almost 30min for our check, and once he brought our food out, he would dissapear for 15-20min...service was way too slow here...we even asked the other waitress to get our check, but she insisted our waiter would be here shortly. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Overall, this place failed to deliver quality steaks and service. \u00a0The service was slow, they kept us waiting on food and our check, which makes a very unhappy customer. \u00a0The steaks we ordered weren't from the \"recommended\" menu, maybe thats why they didnt turn out good, but i'd expect quality food on the whole menu! \u00a0 The chefs really need to learn to time the entrees, all food should come out at once. \u00a0The steak also needs to be cooked right, which the chefs failed to do! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 Ohh one last point, when we sent back our steaks, the waiter tried to bill us twice for both the steaks, we notice'd a double charge on our bill..pretty shady by the waiter! \u00a0He tried to play it dumb when we told him, but it was so obvious he tried to double charge us for no reason...bad food and service overall! \u00a0But maybe its because we didnt order from the tasting menu, which is 100+ per person.", "Date": "2009-12-30", "Author_Location": "Mountain View, CA"}, {"Author": "Sylvia M.", "ReviewID": "n9dpnpwxkc6CAuQVGF2-OQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yes, I had a magnificent steak.

Me and the bf were seated in a comfy booth, which I requested when I previously made our reservation online on MGM's website. \u00a0Our server introduced himself and also wished us a happy anniversary. \u00a0**On a sidenote, I mentioned this detail in my online reservation and so I'm pretty sure he was aware of that detail since we didn't specifically tell him of our occasion.** \u00a0We placed our drink orders: my bf ordered a Martini and I ordered a Champagne Martini. \u00a0A lady carrying a large professional camera then came up to us and asked if we wanted our picture taken. \u00a0We said sure and for the next minute or so, I felt like we were at a photo studio with the poses she suggested we do and the bright flash going off every other second. \u00a0She told us she'd bring the photos back later for us to look at and with that she left. \u00a0Our drinks came out along with the cute mini bread loaf and butter. By this time we already knew what to order: -No appetizer since 2 side dishes and our entrees would be more than enough for the both of us-2 Side Dishes: the Roasted Garlic and Leek Gratin & the Roasted Corn -Entrees: the 8oz Wagyu Beef (medium) for me & the 10oz Wagyu Beef (medium well) for the bfBy the time our order was brought out, we had also ordered a 2nd round of drinks. \u00a0The past 2 times we've eaten here, we've always ordered the Leek Gratin because of its creamy garlicky deliciousness. \u00a0We had never eaten leeks until Craftsteak, but the boatload of butter, cream and roasted garlic added to the dish and you might not realize you are eating leeks cuz its that damn good. \u00a0 The past 2 times we've been to Craftsteak we've ordered the spinach which is good, but not great and so we settled on the Roasted Corn...it easily became our 2nd side dish for future visits. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, tasted lovely, as usual, and easily devoured. I was also completely surprised at how my champagne martini paired well with my meal. \u00a0The champagne's bubbliness cut through the heaviness of the rich gratin and meaty steak. At the end of our dinner, our server asked if we wanted any dessert. \u00a0When we said no, he kept jokingly asking us if we were really sure. \u00a0We told him we were happily stuffed and couldn't fit anything else in our bellies. \u00a0He left and a few minutes later he presented us with a small plate of bite-sized sweets and the words \"Happy Anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate. \u00a0OMG, super cute and super sweet!No sooner had he left, when the lady who took our photos presented us with different photos and an option to purchase a (cheesy) pleather album containing our choice of any 2 photos. \u00a0Since the photos did come out cute, I picked the 2 photos while the bf handled the cost. \u00a0The grand total for this pleather album with 2 photos????? \u00a0$85. Yes, $85 for 2 pictures in a cheesy black pleather album. \u00a0However, given that we were in Vegas, on our anniversary, and presented with great looking photos of the both of us together we couldn't say no. \u00a0As a 'freebie' the lady threw in 2 wallet sized pictures also in a cheesy pleather wallet carrier. \u00a0Long review short: I love the service.

Prosciutto San Daniele - Again, great portion. \u00a0A dish with about 10 prosciutto slices laid out. \u00a0 However, I was hoping that the prosciutto came with something else. \u00a0Melons, asparagus, garnishments... anything to break up just eating cured meat alone. 2. Buffalo Mozzarella, Red Pepper Caponata - \u00a0Mozzarella was very fresh and good texture/taste. \u00a0The red pepper \"salsa\" was a bit salty and didn't provide anything additional to the mozzarella. \u00a0Whole toasted hazelnuts garnished the plate, which, although were tasty, again did nothing for the appetizer.3. \u00a0Bread - Great presentation. \u00a0It came out in its own cask iron plate, piping hot. \u00a0However, there was a tad too much salt on top. \u00a0The bread was light and airy. \u00a0I didn't want to try to bite into a large roll. \u00a0However, when I tried to just eat the bread cut in half, the salty top was a bit much. 4.

Wine was on the table in minutes. \u00a0He boxed up and substituted a dessert for us that would survive the show (ie took off the ice cream and put on some yummy pastry). \u00a0THIS man knew how a fine dining experience should be done and we sat down, pissed off and negative and walked out, loving the place.And now the food. Wow, wow, wow. \u00a0After the early entree to the establishment, we really thought this better damn well be worth it! And oy vey was it. \u00a0We had the cheaper Waygu tasting menu, I the filet and husband the Ribeye - and this was simply the most sublime steak experience of my life. \u00a0Perfection in the cooking would be understatement - it was just off the hook great. \u00a0Everything else that came out was equally impressive, sides of spinach and sweet potatoes, a Lobster Bisque soup that was simply amazing in it simplicity and freshness. \u00a0The Parker House rolls they feed you are divine as well. \u00a0Anyway, hats off Tom Colicchio, as what was going to be a very bad review, has become a great one. I would go back in a second for that kind of professionalism. The prices are not for the squeamish but I am pretty sure you know that walking in right? \u00a0But for what you get, the tasting menu is a decent value.

It's place is deep in the MGM grand but not hard to find. When we go there, we were sat right away. The hostess was very friendly and asked how we were doing while she took us to the table. We sat down and looked over the menu. One server comes over and greets us and takes our beverage order. he was kind of a younger guy. then another guy comes over (a little older) and takes our food order.

I think that's awesome they partnered up their servers at this restaurant, they can be on top of things. But anyway they bring out dinner rolls. They look like normal dinner rolls with sea salt sprinkled on top. I buttered it up and took a bite, it was a little toasty on the outside and so soft on the inside and oh my that salt goes so well with the roll. I didn't want to eat anymore because I knew I was gonna get full but I did anyway haha. We ordered the Hama Hama oysters and there were a few condiment. It was amazing and so fresh. We wanted to order another half dozen but didn't. We also ordered a Caesar salad, i didn't care too much for it. My scallops were cooked perfect!

I think there was a little bit of confusion with the wait staff managing our table and two wait staffs kept asking us about water and placing our orders. But, the wait staff did do a good job in outlining choices and offered us the suggestion to go with the tasting menu, which was a really good deal for $60/person. 2. Appetizers - They were alright. I didn't really enjoy the shaved fennel that much because it was very bland. The garden salad tasted a little bitter. The quail was fantastic! 3. Entree - I thought the entrees was very good. I really enjoyed the flat-iron steak and the skirt steaks that was part of the tasting menu. They cooked the meat just the way we asked for and it came out with very powerful flavors. I didn't really enjoy the potato puree as much. I felt it was a bit salty for my taste buds. The Spinach was really nothing too special. I did like the mushroom side dish and it added a bit of a punch to our meat. 4. Dessert - We had a chocolate molten cake and a also a sticky bun type of item, which we really enjoyed. 5. Portion - Big portions. Our tasting menu could have easily fed 3 people. My girlfriend and I were stuffed midway through the entrees and we barely dented our desserts. It was sad to see such good food go to waste but we weren't going to bring it with us to the hotel. Conclusion - Big portions, big flavors, great meats, be choosy on the on sides.

Our party of four arrived for our 9:00 reservation and went to the bar until we were seated. If you like a lemon drop try the lemonhead martini (and the servings are plenty on the 'tini's!) We did the Kobe Beef Surf and Turf tasting menu (the $155 option and since we had the prima card it lowered the price to $130 a person, LOVE that card!) - and we are all still full from last night. The portions and amount of food was pretty amazing. And I am the picky eater in the group and they were more than accommodating, they couldn't have made it any easier!To start we really wanted to try the lobster bisque which isn't included with the tasting menu but we switched one of our main courses so they gave us each a small cup of the bisque to try and it is GOOD! Chunks of lobster in a yummy broth. For our first course we had hawaiian prawns (served with head on and grilled with cocktail sauce),heirloom tomato salad (olive oil and I think he said with champagne vinegar, fresh basil and salt and pepper), roasted red peppers (surprisingly good, served with garlic) & the Kobe beef Tartare (served with bread and a quail egg on top) And yes, that is just ONE course! The prawns were delicious and I love heirloom tomatoes and the salad was yummy and refreshing! For the main course we asked to try the braised short ribs (we traded these with the skirt steak) - there are not enough words to tell you how absolutely amazing, succulent, decadent, flavorful, (seriously) these short ribs are - you HAVE to try these if you go. Our Kobe beef entrees were the flat iron steak and the filet. Our other entree was the Braised Maine Lobster. Served in the shell our waiter took the time to take it out of the shell for us to make it easier. The lobster is served in a broth much like the bisque so we were really happy campers! There was so much lobster, we couldn't believe the portion size on this! They definitely don't skimp here! For our sides we had the asparagus, an assortment of mushrooms, the potato puree, and the sweet corn (the sweet corn was a table favorite - delicious!)And now desert....it was amazing to see all the options that they served us for our final course. Four different types of sorbet (pineapple, strawberry, peach and chocolate), monkey bread with banana ice cream, a rhubarb crisp with tangerine ice cream, vanilla bean cheesecake, peach pavlova, and two small plates of fresh fruit (and I might be forgetting one other desert).

it was a little tougher than I thought it would be. \u00a0It may have been because we ordered med-well. \u00a0Flavor was excellent though. \u00a0Filet mignon though, was a whole other story. \u00a0Wow....I have never tasted beef like this. \u00a0We savored every bit of those 6 slices. \u00a0The special sauce made for each of the cuts also brought out their flavors. \u00a0The accompanied mushroom risotto, asparagus, and surprising Maui onion were all so good. \u00a0Fabulous sides. \u00a0I never thought I would have loved onion so much. \u00a0We began slowing down after 4 slices of steak each. \u00a0Warning: \u00a0It's definitely a lot of food for two people. \u00a0We boxed up a lot to take home. \u00a0I was really excited about dessert, but was a little disappointed. \u00a0The pear sorbet and the cranberry crisp with ginger ice cream were probably my favorites. \u00a0The orange basil ice cream tasted a little like I had just licked a smudge of lotion off my hand. \u00a0Not to my liking. \u00a0The vanilla bean cheesecake was good, but a little too heavy. \u00a0All in all, service was outstanding. \u00a0The system of ordering could have been a bit clearer. \u00a0Food was the best we have eaten for a steakhouse. \u00a0Not stuffy or too formal for a high priced dining experience. \u00a0Decor and ambiance were pleasant. \u00a0i would go back again. \u00a0We're missing the filet...it does melt in your mouth!!!", "Date": "2010-01-02", "Author_Location": "Corona, CA"}, {"Author": "Drew M.", "ReviewID": "9tAbzzdrK4iWt0L9gFWm5Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Solid food all around. \u00a0Good wine.

Our strip did come out overdone, but we sent it back and a medium rare piece came out quickly and perfectly.As our sides, we got the mushroom assortment, Yukon gold mash, and the garlic spinach. The highlight was of course the Yukon gold mash potatoes- creamy, buttery goodness - which was raved by all other Yelpers. Among us four we couldn't finish our 3 cut of meats.Lastly, we had 6 desserts that came out. It should've been 5 but our waiter forgot our request for monkey bread and brought out another dessert by mistake. Don't worry we don't mind the extras.;)We tried a variety of sorbets, cheesecake, monkey bread, apple fritters, and their bread pudding. Surprisingly, the highlight for me was the cheesecake. It was extremely light, fluffy and creamy served with blood oranges. So yummy. My hubby liked the Apple fritters most this time compared to the monkey bread which was his favorite on the last visit.Overall, another pleasant and enjoyable dining experience with great company. This will probably continue to be our go-to restaurant for steak.", "Date": "2011-03-28", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Kimmy C.", "ReviewID": "hGxfnyKuGAqqienNTgCj2g", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Poorly organized hostess started the meal off on a sour note.

Can't decide where to eat? Sushi, Italian, French, seafood, or even a famous Vegas buffet? With so many choices, a decision can be difficult. Let me give you a suggestion: How about Craftsteak? Craftsteak is fine dining, exquisite ambience, professional service, scrumptious food, and hearty portions. Yes, you will have to drop some serious scratch and, yes, you will need a reservation. Listen, if you have even to ask these two questions then this place is not for you. I'm talking about fine dining at an elite steak house on the Strip. If you don't understand what that consists of, please stop reading this and wasting your time (The 99 cent value meal from the golden arches and the two for one buffet are down the street).Reservations were for a Friday evening at 7:15pm. Arrived approximately 7:10pm and was seated right away. Restaurant was packed. Hostess proceeded to seat us in an awesome booth in the corner of the dining room. Perfect view to see everything that was going down as well as everyone coming and going. At first glance the menu can be a little daunting, but with help from the knowledgeable server, ordering was a breeze. (Hint: Go with what they call the chef's menu) We decided on the Wagyu Beef menu-Three salads, three side dishes, two cuts of meat and three desserts. \u00a0We also had the audacity to order the Maine lobster a la carte. We decided to go this route instead of ordering the Wagyu surf and turf for one simple reason. With the surf and turf you don't get to choose your cuts of meat. The way we ordered, we got to choose our cuts of meat and still get the lobster. After placing our menu selections we received homemade rolls, which were excellent. A few minutes later we received grilled prawns. Simultaneously my girlfriend and I looked at each other and promptly informed our server we did not order that particular dish. He informed us that each table receives a warm appetizer. I hate to say it, but the prawns were our least favorite dish. Not bad, but just could have done without. The salads followed and were absolutely spectacular. We ordered: the Persian cucumber, watercress and ginger; the wild arugula, shaved pecorino, and pine nuts; and last, but definitely not least, the Italian buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts. All three were unbelievable.At this point we were very satisfied with the quality of the food and service. But let's continue on to the main course. Our sides included kale with pancetta and navy beans, heirloom cauliflower with garlic, and faro with pork confit and wild mushrooms. All three were divine. The kale dish had a real southern flavor (and was my personal favorite of the side dishes). \u00a0The cauliflower dish was not only visually stunning but also delectable (the girlfriend's favorite side dish). The faro was absolutely delicious as well! As if you didn't know what was coming next. Yes, the MEAT. We ordered the Wagyu Filet Mignon and the Ribeye. Both cuts were cooked perfect (rare to medium rare). Tender, juicy, melt in your mouth goodness.To be completely honest with you, words cannot and have not done this meal justice. Absolute culinary mastery. Except for one thing... what happened to the lobster? We never received the lobster. My girlfriend and I noticed early in our main course that the lobster was not there, but both of us decided not to say anything unless it ended up on the bill. (Maybe the server didn't hear our order correctly, or maybe another server grabbed the dish by accident and our server thought someone else brought it out. I don't know.) \u00a0But, we were both so full at this point I was actually secretly glad we didn't receive the lobster. I don't know if we could have eaten any more without bursting at the seams.Dessert, oh sweet dessert! If you have read any of my other reviews you would know I am a big fan of French press coffee. \u00a0Craftsteak has one of the best French press coffees I have had. Next came FOUR desserts: Fresh fruit, Chocolate torte with homemade cr\u00e8me fraiche and orange marmalade, Mango basil and lemon sorbets, and Cinnamon Monkey Bread with Cinnamon Ice Cream! Are you effing kidding?! Heaven on earth! The cinnamon monkey bread was out of this world. Pure bliss!Upon receiving the bill, I informed the server that we never received the lobster. He was very apologetic, adjusted the bill, and gave us the coffee on the house. Craftsteak was a memorable experience. I would love to give Craftsteak five stars, but just can't. \u00a0Five stars is perfection! If the prawns would have never come out of the kitchen and the lobster would have; Craftsteak would and probably could have achieved just that. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend Craftsteak for any occasion and would most definitely go back! 10-4 good buddy.

I went with a party of 7 so we got a variety of steaks to share. We ordered the lamb, filet mignon, ribeye, NY, tbone, chicken, and wagyu ribeye. The steaks were all were cooked medium rare with the exception of the NY, which was medium well. I got the ribeye wagyu and expected it to be amazing. Like the other review said, your expectations for a $115 steak are pretty high, but it disappointed. Did not melt in your mouth and I didn't see any marbling in the steak whatsoever. Was not tough, but tougher than my mothers aged NY strip. The dry aged ribeye wasn't that impressive at all. It was medium rare but still tough. Go figure The lamb was pretty good. Nice and tenderThe filet mignon was close to melt in your mouth, but just not there. It also needed seasoning because it was pretty bland. The tbone was cooked pretty decently and seasoned well. It was the only steak that had fat on it, which is a plus because it gave it a little extra flavor. The NY strip was by far the best. And it's kind of ironic because it was cooked medium well. It was the most tender and seasoned steak of all the choices we had to sample. The chicken was meh. It wasnt dried out, which is a plus, but it wasn't seasoned that much either. The skin was toasted and seasoned, but I guess the seasoning didn't make it's way to the meat. For the sides, we had the brussels sprouts, the Caesars salad, the mozzarella, potato pur\u00e9e, fingerling potatoes, and mushrooms. The ones that stuck out the most were the brussels sprouts and the mushrooms. They were both bursting with flavor and I definitely recommend them. All in all, the steaks we just ok.

It was our only big dinner out on our quick trip to Vegas. I had enjoyed a lunch at Craft in Century City a year ago, and we are big fans of Top Chef. Too bad the quality that Tom C. expects on that show has been left to wither at Craftsteak. It started with being seated next to a server station. Of course most everyone is since they put it right in the middle of each dining section. The back to the chair in which my dining partner was sitting was broken. It took standing up and physically trying a nearby empty chair to get any attention. It also took us some time before we realized that we were being served by a \"team\". Usually roles are clear when there are multiple servers. Here there was no head waiter, just two completely uncoordinated partners. One would ask if we wanted to be walked through the menu. We said, \"no thanks.\" Then the other waiter swung by and launched into an in depth description without asking. When asked if I wanted to keep the wine list, I said, \"yes, thank you.\" Then the other waiter came by and took it away without asking. More to the point, one of the two had no idea or ability to articulate what came with the shellfish sampler. It took asking three times to get to the fact that there was lobster, and another few questions to confirm that it was in a salad mixture of some sort. Icing on the cake: the busboy soaked us with his table rag while cleaning the table next to us. Gross. Bottom line: this is not service worthy of the reputation or the price tag. The food was a great big MEH. Here's the quick breakdown:Wagyu tartare - delicious, but not the best I've had. Prefer the traditional French bistro/brasserie preparation.Fried zucchini blossoms - terrible. Turned one of my favorite sides/apps into piles of greasy, deep fried breading. Blossoms practically unrecognizable. Ribeye - very tasty, well cooked, right on the money.Strip - fine, but not remarkable.Risotto w/peas and shrooms - delicious, perfectly al dente and creamy.Ramps & morels - ok, but uber salty.Snow peas - delicious! fresh and crispy.Au gratin - mediocreHad a Pinot Noir and a Cab by the glass.

I'm a huge Top Chef fan and CraftSteak was the first reservation I made when I decided to go to Vegas. First of all can I just say how creepy it is to stare directly at a painting of a cow with the words \"Sirloin\" written on it while I'm eating a steak. I'm not by any means vegetarian but I'm not going to go eat my fried chicken next to the chicken coop. Im sure most people appreciate the ironic art but I wasn't a fan. The old-school lights were neat. That's about it. Husband got the raw oysters, he thought they were great. I had the lobster bisque. It was just okay and the licorice herb on top might have been more complimentary if it was chopped finer. I got a big mouthful and it ruined the rest of the soup for me. The husband had to finish it. I will say, the steak was hands down the best steak I've ever had. If I remember correctly it was an aged T-Bone. I usually like my steaks seared with a nice crust but this just melted in my mouth and the drippings in the bottom of the pan made my eyes roll back in my head. We ordered the mixed mushrooms and the zucchini as sides and neither were impressive. The chocolate souffle with caramel and hazelnut ice cream was worth every penny. The service was odd. Apparently we had two waiters but I never saw the second except for at the beginning and when we were leaving and some of our food was delivered by a random third person. Our main waiter was super nice but I have a hard time with accents in loud restaurants and couldn't understand what he was saying half the time and then when I asked him what the licorice-y herb was that was on my soup and the steak, he told me it was rosemary.

My wife and I dined there on 09/30 for my B'day while in Las Vegas- we chose this steak house because we are both Top Chef fans and thought it would a great way to celebrate. Upon arriving, we were seated in a prompt manner and that was probably the best experience we had all night. In short- I was HIGHLY disappointed with our meal and experience. Our service was terrible because our waiter was awful. They use a \"team\" approach, but one guy was the main person for our service and he doesn't even belong at an Outback. He more than once tried to entertain the table seated next to us- while engaged with my wife and I, he challenged my wife on a glass of bourbon she ordered from their menu (made a bit of a show by flipping threw their 100 page drink menu at the table instead of inquiring with the bar), never told us anything about the menu, and when I asked if there were any chef specials for the night, his response was \"our menu is printed every day, so I like to think that everything is special\". He was very unprofessional and he never once talked about the steaks on the menu they had to offer!! Needless to say, I didn't order one. The basics of service were never covered. I even had to order another glass of bourbon from the bus boy after sitting without one for about 10 minutes- that's how bad it was. If you are going to charge the prices they do, I don't care if you are busy, slow, or completely dead, there is a level of service that is expected and should be executed on. Tom C talks about this all the time on his show, and maybe we got the only bad apple out of the group, but we were both appalled by at one point, upset about it.

My husband and I had the fall/winter tasting menu ($70/pp) which you have to now ask for (it was that popular that they don't talk about it on their menus anymore, so be sure and ask!) and you literally get to try everything they mention on the menu. I've never been anywhere that did that before, usually you have to choose your \"app, entree & dessert\" out of a few choices. It was great to be able to try it all! The wait service was one of the best I've had at any restaurant in my life. They kept bringing out more and more food, I couldn't believe it! Definitely a place where you get the most bang for your buck. We had 4 salads (a fennel salad, mozzarella salad, quail and cranberry salad, and a cucumber salad), 3 entrees (two kinds of steak, both cooked perfectly, and giant scallops, also cooked perfectly), 3 sides (the great potato puree everyone talks about, some awesome braised brussel sprouts, and braised mushroom medley), and two desserts (lava cake and monkey bread). I've never eaten so much in my life, but it was so worth it.

The potatoes were not cooked as thoroughly as I would have liked and rather bland, and then the zucchini was downright bad.

We both love a good steak and I am a huge Top Chef fan, so we decided that for our 10 year anniversary we would finally see (taste) what everyone was talking about. I made the reservation about 2 months ahead of time online so that was not a problem. The night of our visit (4/30), we ran into the \"cab line from hell\" so we called to let them know we were running late. They were friendly and said it should not be a problem. When we arrived less than 5 minutes late for our reservation we were greeted and told that it would be a couple of minutes. We waited over 20 minutes to be seated as they were very busy. The \"reservationless\" people that inquired about tables were told that none were available until 10:30 PM (it was 8PM at the time). Once seated in a very nice area of the dining room (don't sit in the bar unless you have to) we were promptly greeted by both of our waiters. We quickly ordered drinks and were served the delicious rolls and butter that everyone else has mentioned. They are delish- I tried to avoid eating my 3 before my meal arrived, but they were so good I could not resist (also I would have been really starving had I waited, but more on that later). I ordered that Black Cherry Fizz and my husband had a Captain Morgan (Private Stock) and Coke. Both drinks were great. Our waiter gave us a very thorough explanation of the menu, especially the 3-course section. We decided on the 10oz filet for me and the 6oz filet and half lobster for my husband, as well as the fried zucchini blossom on the side. So began the wait, and some more wait, and more wait. The staff was friendly and attentive, but nobody said anything like\"sorry it is taking so long\", etc. In all, I believe our meal did not arrive until 40 minutes after we ordered. It seemed like all the tables around us were waiting just as long, so maybe that is just how they do service there. We had not ordered any appetizers or a 1st course so we were starving. Now for the good stuff-the food was great! Both steaks were cooked exactly to order-rare and medium rare and tasted wonderful. My husband's lobster was excellent also. The only thing we did not \"love\" was the zucchini blossom. It was truly fried and a bit too greasy. The tomato aioli dipping sauce was a nice accent though. We ate every bite of our meals and so we were too full for dessert (the selection looked great).However, one of the the food runners brought us each a plate of 4 mini chocolate pies with pieces of carmelized pineapple on top. Wow- that was absolutely great. Maybe because it was not expected, but also it was a very tasty dessert and I usually only order Creme Brulee or an ice cream dessert. There was no charge for the dessert so I think that they gave it to us because I had mentioned in the online reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary. Overall we had a very excellent experience at Craftsteak. The plus side was the food. The downside was the extensive wait time to sit and to eat. We would probably only go back for another special occasion since it is very expensive (my hubby wouldn't even let my see the bill), but we knew that going in.

Did some research, from what I understand this restaurant lets their steaks set for a while before they are served. The manager says that this helps keeps the meat's juices inside the steak according to them. The only problem I see is if you let them set out in the open to long at room tempature the steaks come out to the customer cold, which was our case.

We had eight people in our party, so we were able to sample a variety of items. We had reservations at 5:45 pm and were seated promptly. Setting: the restaurant itself was very attractive and pleasant.Noise level: average for a higher end restaurant.Wait staff: Friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. Were not overly intrusive and were willing to split the bill in half, giving us two separate charges.Food: Very good to excellent. Tried veal, ribeye (both the individual 16 oz and the 32 oz, bison, hanger steak, and veal. Got the quail, Maui onions, asparagus, sweet potato and mashed potatoes. The dessert was chocolate, monkey bread, and sorbet. As mentioned overall the food was terrific. The only marginal item was the bison. Three people ordered the bison and one of the three was bit overcooked. The best item was the hanger steak, really juicy, tender, and tasty. Having been Ruth Chris, Morton's, and a variety of high end steakhouse in our local area, I think that the quality of the food (main course and sidedishes) at Craftsteak is a least one or two notches above these other establishments.Cost: Average of $80 per person-without any alcohol.In summary, if you want a really good steak and are willing to pay the price, Craftsteak is a good choice.The four stars is for the quality of the food (very high) and the cost(also very high).

If there is one word to describe the meal it would be BLAND BLAND BLAND. I don't know if the chef was out of town because it was Labor Day week-end or what, but everything was barely warm, and tasteless. We went with the Waygu tasting menu when I asked about a wine pairing they said to pick any \"flight\" of wine that was offered because they would all go with the meal. Having had many tasting and degustation menus at many other restaurants I was very surprised by this, there was always a certain wine for each course not a \"one size fits all\" mindset. We decided to opt out of the wine flights and stick with mixed drinks. \u00a0Our first course was Lobster Bisque which was thin and barely room temperture and as we started to eat that, out came the salads, Caesar, Heirloom Tomatoe, and Buffalo Mozzarella again all I can say is BLAND BLAND BLAND no taste or seasoning what-so-ever. Now I was begining to get really worried about our main course and I was right to worry. The steaks, while cooked fine were as tasteless as everything else, and keep in mind that all of this was served to us with-in 30 minutes of seating down. When you go out for a meal like this is \"supposed\" to be, I don't expect to be rushed in and out the door. There were plenty of empty tables so it's not like they were busy. Anyway, I was so dissapointed in everything that after one bite of the steak my husband and I both decided to send it back. To the restaurants credit they did take it back and offer to make us something else but we just asked for our check and left. They did not charge us for the meal, just the drinks we had.
