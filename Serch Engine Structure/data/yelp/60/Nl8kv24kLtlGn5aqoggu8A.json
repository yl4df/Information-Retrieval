However, since I have turned 21 and came upon their happy hour, I absolutely love this place! I am here like every week now due to happy hour for their food and drinks. I love their strawberry beer, so for anyone who doesn't really like beer and wants something sweet, I recommend trying it. It tastes like strawberry and you can't taste the beer. I always always get their truffle fries, not just one, but two each time I got with just my boyfriend. We also get their wings, traditional, firecracker style. It's amazing, I highly recommend trying it. We also love their sashimi. These three items, the sashimi, wings, and truffle fries fill up two hungry people! Do expect to wait for happy hour if you come on a Friday! Otherwise, Monday-Thursday is not too bad. I recommend getting there around 5:30pm so you have time to look over the menu and order. It is also not too early for dinner, since you can take your time eating and be done by 7pm! The night is still young to go out! Customer service is amazing here. All the times I have gone, I have gotten such wonderful service. Keep up the good work guys!", "Date": "2014-07-14", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Shauna S.", "ReviewID": "gOVbXDRD871qC4pcMT0KIw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Yard House probably wishes I'd take a few days to calm down to give them a review, but I'm going to be fair. Really, based on my experience last night alone, I would give them no stars, however because I was part of a large group, I will be a little more forgiving.I was part of a group of 12 (originally). They arrived around 6:15pm on a Wednesday night to get a table. I arrived with a friend at 7pm, and we ordered a beer from the bartender. That experience alone took much too long, but we laughed it off and waited with friends for a table. Around 8pm, I started to wonder what was going on, how long this would take. It was around this time that we had to add three people to our table reservation. I understand that once we added the extra people, there would be an extended wait. But we had already been waiting almost two hours. We didn't get a table until 9pm. When we sat down, my friend noticed there was a drip in the ceiling above her. It was dripping on her shirt, in her hair, and in her purse. There was a small puddle on the floor. I noticed a manager standing nearby, so I told him about the drip. He informed me that they were renovating the keg room above our heads, and that was probably causing the drip. And? He says to me, \"there is an open seat at the end of your table, would you like me to move your friend to that seat?\" Um...are you kidding? No. I would like you to do something about the drip. Eventually my friend suggested we just move the table over a few inches, which solved our problem.We ordered food, and FINALLY ate around 9:30pm (ahhhh I'm starving by this point). I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and was completely not impressed. It was \"good,\" to be fair. I had had it here once before, many years ago, and didn't remember a ginormous amount of fried onion string rings on the top of the salad. I mean, it literally looked like a whole side order, just dumped on top of my salad. It was almost disgusting how much of it there was. I removed them, and ate the salad, which was fine.My friend ordered the Poke appetizer, as she had before. When I finished eating, I noticed she had eaten everything off the plate except the poke. She said there was something off about it. Thankfully, when we told the server, she had it taken off the bill. A different manager (a female - very nice) came over to tell us that she was looking into it, and would take it off the bill. Honestly, by 1015 when we left, I was not very happy, and not satisfied. Shockingly, there were STILL people waiting for a table at that time on a WEDNESDAY night! Ugh. Not worth it. Especially with all the great restaurants on Santana Row. I wouldn't come here for anything other than a beer again.", "Date": "2014-07-17", "Author_Location": "Campbell, CA"}, {"Author": "Patricia G.", "ReviewID": "PKnR86Vx2lxfRa28aZEbcA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Second time visiting this place.

We ordered the steak and shrimp plate which they were very easy about switching grilled shrimp to a nice tempura fried one they have. I ordered a garlic noodle plate that came with crab shrimp and lobster. Honestly the seafood was good. It didn't have a string garlic taste which I was hoping and they throw more noodles on there than I'd like. But all in all pretty good service.

We got a few drinks like the timmermans strawberry beer and the honey kolsh. I really enjoyed the strawberry beer - it was light and easy. The honey kolsh had a bittersweet taste to it but was also pretty light compared to other beers. We also ordered three appetizers - fried calamari, the onion ring tower and the blue crab cakes. Huge portions on the first two - but the crabs cakes only came with two pieces and reminded me of overpriced chicken nuggets. I would have given four stars if it wasn't for the service.

Our server was also unfamiliar with the menu - being that it was our first time there, we didn't know that the strawberry beer didn't come in half yards - but apparently he didn't know that either because he came back to the table after another 10 minutes to inform us that it wasn't available in half yards. Speaking of coming to our table - he came to check and chatted with us once. He did however come by stare at us about five times without saying a word. I don't know if this is a norm for servers here but we felt kind of uncomfortable with him doing so.

We were all looking forward to it. There was a bit of a wait which was no problem we just got some drinks at the bar in the mean time. We got seated shortly after and the bartender told my friend she could transfer over her bar tab to the table. Super convenient, right? Well this is where the night takes a turn for the worst.The waitress says they can't find the tab and this is an ongoing battle for about 20 minutes or so while she and her manager look for it. The waitress tells us she gave the bar tab to the manager and the manager lost it. We offer to tell her our drinks (after my friend had already told her the name our tab was under AND gave the waitress her credit card AGAIN) so she can add them to the tab but she says not to worry about it, it's 'good karma' coming back and we don't have to pay for the drinks. AWESOME! We're stoked especially since it's my friend's birthday and that's an added bonus. However, an hour later the waitress comes back and says the manager found the tab and now we have to pay for it. WHAT? That's absurd. You can't say our drinks are free and then renege on that an hour later. That's horrible customer service. You as a manager should deal with it and realize it was your mistake and deal with the repercussions. If you say your customers drinks are free, don't come back a ridiculous amount of time later and say \"oh jk! you have to pay!\" especially on someone's birthday.This ruined our whole Yard House experience which is a shame because I grew up going to the Yard House in Long Beach, CA every year for my birthday!

It's my go-to spot for happy hour because of the awesome selection and prices (1/2 off select appetizers, pizzas, and drinks). However, this location doesn't stack up and it's disappointing to have to give it a 2-star rating. 2.5 stars would be more accurate but Yelp doesn't do half star ratings (yet). After catching a movie, I came here for dinner with friends on a Friday night. My party of 4 anticipated a looong wait. It turned out to be a a little over an hour, which is not so bad when you're at Santana Row and you have good company to pass the time with. However, once inside, we were seated at a table close to the bar and had a near-impossible time hearing each other and our waiter. I was really hoping for a booth but they were all full. Throughout the night, I felt like I was at a concert and I'm pretty sure I sounded like a broken record saying \"WHAT??\" a million times. Maybe I'm just getting old but this place is a few decibels too loud at night. I never had this issue when I went to the Yard House location in Irvine or Newport for dinner though. As for the actual service, it was alright--the place was super packed so our waiter didn't check up on us as often as I'd like--but it was definitely marred by the noise level. At least one thing is constant from location to location and that's the food. If you don't go during happy hour, it's a bit pricey $$. For appetizers, we shared the fried calamri, bearnaise sliders, and ahi sashimi. We also ordered a bbq chicken pizza and lobster garlic noodles! I especially enjoyed the lobster garlic noodles and would also highly recommend ordering the garlic truffle tries if you like flavorful, shoe-string fries. I didn't order a drink this time but I usually opt for the Southern Belle. This is the only Yardhouse near me but I'm not sure if I'll be returning to this specific location unless it's during happy hour or some random time during the week.

He downed both with no leftovers besides my truffle fries he couldn't finish.I had half my meal leftover for the next day and it was still delicious, except for the salad.

It's allllllright, and I understand that being located in an ambiance-driven strip like Santana Row can allow an establishment to get away with a lot, but the high prices and lackluster service is somewhat frustrating.Yard House is located towards the opening of Santana Row, and the inside has dim sports bar lighting complete with quite a few flat-screens. It can be dressed either up or down, so you'll get the casual sportswear as well as formal dinnerwear. They're famous for their half and full yards of beer, as well as their extensive beer selection. It's always crowded here, and the wait time never seems to be under an hour at nighttimes. They don't take reservations for weekend dinner dining, which makes no sense to me. I'd understand if they took reservations but imposed a strict deadline, say ten minutes after the reserved time or whatnot. But to not take reservations at all? We had a party of about twenty people, and the lack of being able to reserve was daunting, especially because we were doing a birthday celebration. The bar area also stresses me out to no end. There are bar seats all around, but it's always full. There's no designated place to order, so you have to squeeze in between people eating their food to try and flag down a bartender. Plus it takes at least fifteen minutes to flag anyone down, ever. I feel like it's worse when you're in your early twenties as well, since the bartenders (and waiters, for that matter) treat you as if you're not as important as the older patrons, and it takes such a long time for any attention. Maybe they've had bad experiences from younger parties before, but for an upscale place, that kind of service every single time is just tiring. The beer selection is pretty impressive, and the mixed drinks (especially mules, I think they're called?) were pretty good. Happy hour food is pretty standard, nothing memorable.

And everyone got to yard house about 45min before the hour we asked for reservations. And now it's been two hours and a half and we're still waiting outside and Yard House has not given us a pager.

The beer is exceptionally great. And the interior is nice.Almost pushing for 2 hours. I'll be back. I'm hoping when I return we will be seated......UPDATE and now our party is down to 16 people.And after complaining and complaining they are fitting 16 people into a tiny 14 seater booth.....seriously. One of the people doesn't even have a table. His sitting in the corner without a table. (They brought a huge table to compensate but trapped everyone on one side) 2 more people left. We are down to 14 people now.How irresponsible is this. The group before us (the tables we were suppose to have) have been here since 3pm! Had paid the bill and take their sweet time...Drinking Alcohol since then...it's 8:37pm now. And they have children 5 years old or so. How can those kids keep sane? I'll tell you how. By running around the place. These people are not sober how can they drive. Despite some people leaving the group is still spanned out within the three round tables so we can't be seated comfortably yet. It is now 8:47pmHad to send back a dirty cup and we found another dirty cup and didn't bother.We finally ordered food. And the party that was in our spot finally left. Manager was rude did I mention?

Our server Erica never once asked as if we needed another round of drinks or any food. We had to flag her down to ask for it. This was not a busy night because she had time to mingle with another group of guys at a nearby table as well as chit chatting with her co-workers. So after a while of eating and drinking we finished our meal AND our drinks. This rarely happens because we always get brought another round. After some time she cleared our table and did not ask if we needed anything else. By this point our glasses of beer were empty and we were sipping on water for quite some time. Normally the waiters would ask us if we would like more drinks before we finished, because it does takes a while for the next drinks to arrive, which is understandable. When she finally came around to take our order for more drinks she just took off right after, and my friend didn't get a chance to place another food order in. She was not attentive at all, unapproachable, and with no friendly demeanor. Maybe she was having an off day, but it doesn't mean she should ignore us. Eventually we found the manager and just wanted to let her know about our experience. I did see that the manager talk to her afterwards near the cashier where our table was. The waitress then decided to talk to her co-workers in front of us about it. How do I know, because they were looking over to our table as they were talking, as if we did something wrong.

Now, any great restaurant, you'd expect a wait because the demand is much higher than the amount of seats available. Fine. But when you go any day of the week, any time after 5 PM you're quoted 2+ hours, that's just nuts. Probably not their fault, I'm sure customers aren't jumping out of their seats as they chew their last bite, but there's other fish to fry here. Prices are a bit on the outrageous side. I said they have unique dishes but even so, all of them are over priced and the bill is always pricey. This could also have to do with its location: Santana Row. That place is a parking lot. Yes, it has parking lots, but they're full, so literally anywhere you drive, you'll be forced to stop within the next 5-7 feet for long periods of time. It also drives the price up.Now, since I don't believe the building can just pick up and roll away, I am a fan of Yard House. Great atmosphere accommodates good food and a tremendous beer selection.

While the staff was much better this time around (refills came before our drinks were empty and everyone was smiling and in a good mood), there were still several issues with our food that made for a negative experience. Full disclosure: I was given a $50 gift card by Yard House after my Roseville experience, which was put to use during this visit. Food consistency seems to be a problem between restaurants, because several items that we had at the Roseville location (which we patronize semi-frequently) tasted different/worse in San Jose. The deviled eggs were goopy and the fried chicken was bland and in need of pepper. The pepperoni & mushroom pizza was passable, and my vegetarian tacos were amazing, but the korean beef appetizer came out cold and was sent back. When it returned, it looked like the same entry but microwaved as the plate was hotter than the food was. An ahi steak sandwich lacked flavor and was sent back, replaced by the always-reliable Mac & Cheese squared. I understand Yard House is a chain restaurant, but The Cheesecake Factory across the way and Maggiano's Little Italy down the street both know how to put out large quantities of good food consistently. For some reason, that consistency has never been encountered at Yard House.

My friend and I were seated in the corner which was nice, because it was much quieter than sitting in the center area surrounding the bar. WE ORDERED:Drinks:1) Pineapple Express (skyy infusions pineapple vodka, malibu pineapple rum, monin mojito, fresh pineapple and mint): Really just a cool name for a pineapple mojito. Pretty decent.2) Southern Belle (jeremiah weed sweet tea vodka, lemonade, fresh strawberries and pineapple): Tasted literally just like an Arnold Palmer, but with alcohol in it. I liked both drinks pretty equally. None of them wow'ed me, but I would order them again.Food:1) Truffle fries: I thought they were pretty decent, but not the best truffle fries I've ever had. I like ooey gooey truffle cheese melted on top of my fries, but these were just like regular fries covered with shredded parmesan, with truffle oil layered on top. They were good and I ate them all, BUT I've definitely had better.2) Mac + Cheese (chicken breast, applewood bacon, wild mushrooms, cheddar, parmesan, campanelle pasta and truffle oil): Obvsly a fancier version of your classic mac n cheese. I really liked it, all of the ingredients combined really spiced up the dish!3) Angel Hair Pasta (roma tomatoes, roasted eggplant, garlic, basil, pine nuts, feta, parmesan and olive oil): My friend got this.

The wait time was shorter in reality and we all headed to the bar to grab drinks. Although tough to flag down the bartenders, I eventually got all my drinks. Guiltily, I tried the Half-Yard of Pyramid Hefeweizen, AMF, Pineapple Express (Skyy infusions pineapple vodka, Malibu pineapple rum, monin mojito, fresh pineapple and mint), Moscow Mule, and the Scooby Snack shot. My favorite had to be the AMF or the Scooby Snack shot! It was quite a night! My party was getting rowdy and I sympathized with the servers. Service was hectic that Friday night and a managerial employee came over to help as well. Most of their drinks were legit and strong and definitely the AMF was packed with a quick punch of drunk.Please try their foods here. I mean these are God's leftovers!!! The SWEET POTATO FRIES with Maple Bacon Cream Dip is simply divine. I literally ate the whole dish by myself in shame haha. Perfect crispy fries with bacon dip, yes please! SHIITAKE GARLIC NOODLES (tossed with butter, garlic & shiitake mushrooms, topped with parmesan & chives) was also very savory and umami. The consistency of the tossed noodles and accompaniments were marinated perfectly. I would definitely recommend these if you are looking for succulent appetizers!For their Main Entrees, I recommend the ANGEL HAIR PASTA (with roma tomatoes, roasted eggplant, garlic, basil, pine nuts, feta, parmesan and olive oil) and SPICY JAMBALAYA (blackened jumbo shrimp, spicy chicken-andouille sausage, red and pasilla peppers pan blackened with sweet crawfish and cajun tomato cream sauce with linguini pasta, jasmine or brown rice) -- taken from their restaurant website (yardhouse.com)There are no better entrees at Yardhouse. Everything else is a lie. The Angel Hair Pasta may not LOOK impressive as the other dishes but it tasted so beautifully melodic. The noodles and sauce were in perfect portions- not dried out or overly oily and slimy. The presentation of the dish was pristine and white. The Jambalaya was a \u00a0sweet, tangy treat offered with fresh shrimp and sausages marinated in a bed of sauces and spices. Definitely better than the Jambalaya I had at Elephant Bar. Of course, the location is in Santana Row and the ambiance is casual yet romantic. The dim lighting inside the restaurant provides the mysterious aura for a hearty meal and loving mood.", "Date": "2014-04-18", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Cindy C.", "ReviewID": "wgfa-Qx56q3BK_RTF9KAWg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Customer service is extremely important and in their case they didn't nail it this time which is why I deducted a star.My boyfriend and I had finished our movie around 7:30pm on a Saturday night so we knew what we were getting ourselves into when we decided on Yard House. The host was very sweet and told us it'll be a 2 hour wait. She told us to come back at 8:45pm to receive our pager. We came back at the time she said and was told it'll be another half hour - no problem. We waited until our pager buzzed and followed a young lady to our table. We got to the table and it wasn't even cleaned yet. She was nice enough to apologize, but they cleaned up in such a haste that I was actually kind of skeptical to even sit down at that table.The young lady said our host will be with us shortly. It was my first time here so I took a good look at the menu. They had a great selection of drinks - pretty pricey but that's expected. Our waiter finally arrived and he seemed like he was in a big rush. My boyfriend knew exactly what he wanted so he ordered his drink and food. I was still deciding but before I could even ask for my waiter's opinion, he cut me off and said, \"I'll come back later and you can take some more time deciding.\" Then walked off. It's not like I took half an hour to decide. I just needed about 30 more seconds.My boyfriend's drink arrived before I even got to order mine. I finally decided on the Half Yard of the Samuel Adam's Cherry Wheat. The smell was sweet and the first few mouthfuls were great. But once the beer got warm, the bitter after taste was quite overwhelming. We got their famous truffle fries and it was delicious! I will definitely be back for those. We also got the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. It was bigger than expected and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. The food was not a disappointment for sure. I got to see our waiter maybe a total of 5 minutes throughout the night. What was more odd was when my boyfriend went to the bathroom he came by to pick up our plates and asked me, \"Are you guys on your first date?\" Uh... kind of inappropriate considering he hadn't said 2 sentences to me the entire night... I told him we were celebrating my birthday actually and he had to ask me if I would like a birthday dessert - which I guess was sweet of him.The dessert was beautiful and it was a great way to end the night there.

However, I was disappointed on my most recent visit. My coworkers and I came on a Friday for Happy Hour/early dinner, but unfortunately missed the HH cutoff at 6pm. I had called ahead to put our name on the waitlist, so that you don't have to wait quite as long when you get there. Just make sure you don't show up late for that time, otherwise they cross your name off. It took another 20 minutes or so from when we arrived to get a table (around 6:30pm), and we ordered:-Sweet Potato Fries (w/Maple Bacon Cream Dip): Disappointing. The sweet potato fries were soggy and limp. The only thing that saved them was the good flavor of the sweet potato, and the maple bacon cream dip, which was still delicious. I wouldn't order the fries again if they were still soggy.-Pear & Gorgonzola Flatbread (Caramelized Onions, Leeks & Balsamic Syrup): Yuck, I didn't like this flavor combination at all. The moisture from the pear makes the flatbread soggy, and there was a sour taste to this dish. Skip!-Lobster, Crab & Artichoke Dip (Maine Lobster, Blue Crab, Artichoke Hearts, Four Cheese Blend w/Chips & Baked Pita): Yuck- I'm not sure how they manage to screw up a dip. It was dry and clumpy, and you couldn't taste the lobster, crab, or artichoke. Skip!-Fried Calamari (w/Spicy Tomato, Tartar Sauce): Not very good- the calamari was also soggy and limp, and there wasn't much crisp to them. I wouldn't get this again.-Coconut Shrimp (w/Spicy Green Papaya Salad, Sweet Chili Sauce, Thai Basil Pesto): One of the better dishes of the night since the shrimp was actually crunchy. -Lobster Garlic Noodles (Tossed w/Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, Shiitake Mushrooms, Fresh Spinach, Dusted w/Parmesan): Pretty good. Their garlic noodles have always been one of my favorite dishes here, and it didn't disappoint this time. Recommended!The service was a little lackluster since it was difficult to flag down our server at times, and they have different people bring your dishes to you. It would've been nice if our server was more attentive and checked in on us more towards the end. We also thought it was a bit weird that a lot of our dishes came out super quickly, but I ordered a dish to go and it took forever to get it. Yard House is still a great place to go if you're a beer lover since they rotate what beers they have on tap, and have seasonal beers available. I'd still recommend coming for their happy hours (M-F 3-6pm and Sun-W 10pm-close) since the discounted appetizers are a really good deal.

If you do, you should definitely make a trip to the Yardhouse! Yardhouse is known for their wide selection of beers on tap. All the different types of beer are located on the first couple pages of their menu. The restaurant itself is HUGE and spacious with TVs showing different sports' channels. Every time I've came here, it's busy like crazy and it gets pretty loud. The wait can be a bit ridiculous though.. I love their happy hour specials! I've been here for both dinner and happy hour. Their menu has so many options for you to pick from. It's a bit overwhelming because everything sounds so good. Food is a bit more pricier; thus, coming in during happy hour is definitely worth what you pay for. Their happy hours are Monday - Friday from 3PM - 6PM and Sunday - Wednesday 10PM - close. Domestic pints are $3.75, crafts and imports are about $4 - $7, half yards about $7 - $10, and well drinks under $5. Really good deal. Select appetizers and pizzas are half-off. Those appetizers come in BIG portions by the way!So far, I have only tried two of their beers: Timmermans Strawberry and the Gulden Draak 9000 Quad. Even though I am not a huge beer fan, surprisingly I actually liked them. The Timmermans Strawberry was basically a strawberry flavored beer. It tasted pretty fruity and sweet. However, I did wish it was a bit more stronger. The Gulden Draak is a very dark beer with an ABV 10.5%. It tasted pretty sweet with a bit of bitterness. Pretty strong in my opinion. Regardless, it was quite delicious. I'm determined to come back and try more of their beer selections!For food-wise, I have tried their fried calamari, onion ring tower, classic sliders, and BBQ bacon cheddar burger with fries. Their BBQ bacon cheddar burger was so delicious, flavorful, and juicy! Same goes for their classic sliders. Their fried calamari and onion ring towers are delicious too.

Conveniently, I had to return something at H&M anyway. Thirty minutes later and with only three people from our party, we were sitting outside perusing the menu when the pager goes off after only seven minutes! I wasn't complaining. Jaimee kindly asked us how our day was going and if we had any plans for the weekend besides dining at Yard House as she led us down the stairs on the left past all of the eager patrons celebrating Friday. We walked to the round booth tucked in the left hand corner of the restaurant where we could see (and hear) everything, including the central bar in the very middle. Pretty good seats for my first time there! Plus, we had room for six instead of the original five. Our super attentive waitress, Brittany, came by and we ordered the highly anticipated truffle fries, coconut shrimp, and ahi poke bowl. Truffle fries are sooo delicious! We ended up ordering two portions! Thin cut fries tossed in slivers of Parmesan cheese and topped with parsley/rosemary and truffle oil, yum. Tastes like garlic too ($4.45). The coconut shrimp was ok; there were three large butterflied shrimp on top of sweet n spicy sauce (~$14). The ahi had some avocado on it-- good stuff and it was less than $7. Our other friends slowly trickled in and we ordered Gardein Mac+Cheese, jambalaya, fish & chips, and parmesan chicken. It's nice to have the Gardein option for many dishes in case you can't eat meat. My Mac + cheese noodles were interestingly shaped like cones, had mushrooms, breadcrumbs, and lots of gooey cheesiness. The half portion is ~$12.45, full ~$17. I'm thankful the corner we were in had adequate lighting so pics turned out well and I wasn't falling asleep like I would've at Maggiano's or Cheesecake Factory. With all the cheering/celebrating groups around us, I finally felt like it was a real Friday. This first visit was the make or break of whether I'd be back. I've heard lots of good things but seeing the line out the door always stopped me from dining here. Service was impeccable, Brittany checked back multiple times during the two hours we were there and was calm and collected while handling several large loud groups (including one with a birthday where they were pretty tipsy). She adapted easily to all the person additions to our table and was very informative about the six beer samplers, which unfortunately is out until Monday, when they'll have a lot more options.

I was accompanied by my food buddy. We came here on a Tuesday around 5pm. I was expecting it to be crowded but to our surprise it wasn't. Both the outside and inside looks very nice. Big LED Tv's (I hope they're LED & not plasma lol) located everywhere allow you to view the game from anywhere you sit. They also play real music. While we were here I heard Journey, The Eagles, and a few 80's. Good music equals good atmosphere and a good time. I can't remember each song that was playing but every song was amongst my favorites. My food buddy ordered the Lobster Garlic Noodles. I went through the whole menu and couldn't decide what I wanted. I kept coming back to the Lobster Garlic Noodles but I didn't want to order the same because we always order different dishes so we can try each other's food. So I finally settled for the Lobster Garlic Noodles too. The Lobster Garlic Noodles was amazing. It taste as good as it looks. The spinach, mushrooms, and chives go well with the shrimp, lobster and the garlic noodles topped with parmesan cheese (ask for extra Parmesan cheese). A well balanced dish. Perfect size portion and it fills you up. A bit pricy but well worth it.With our order came sweet potato fries which we didn't order. We got our servers attention and asked if we had someone else's order. He said that whoever brought us the sweet potato fires made a mistake. He could take 'em to the kitchen and most likely be tossed in the garbage or we could have them on the house which we did. The maple syrup sauce that comes with the sweet potato fries is very addictive. You just can't stop eating it. You'll probably end up asking for an extra sauce.Before we ordered real food. We had dessert first. It was her idea and she ordered the Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. Served over a pool of caramel and sprinkled nuts, sits the cheesecake with powdered sugar around the plate topped with a scoop of whip cream and mint leaves for decoration. The cheesecake wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be. It appeared to be fluffy which made it easy to dap into the caramel and powdered sugar. A little bit of everything in every bite. It was also happy hour so got the Hawaiian Sunset Martini. For my taste, it wasn't really all that. Our server was very nice and attentive. Checked up on us regularly. My water never went down because it kept being refilled. The staff was also nice. They greeted us from the moment we set foot in to when we left.I'll definitely come back again soon.

The calamari was pretty good, crispy, oily and came with marinara sauce and tartar sauce. I loved the spinach dip and I really liked that their chips were thick and salty. I don't like the cheap-y chips that anyone can grab at the grocery store. I absolutely loved their concept of the California roll. It came out very pretty and looked like a cake!! I also liked that their version had a little kick to it to set them apart. As for the margherita pizza, I wasn't all that fond of it.

They have a beautiful restaurant in a great location, granted parking may be difficult and requires a bit of a walk, but still great location. Inside, there are plenty of seating with variety. You can sit at a table, bar, bar table, round table, and booths. They have beautiful art work and the restrooms are pretty cool. So, there are definitely plenty of things to keep your eyes amazed and loving the experience. The bar is incredible. For a microbrewery, they sure have a lot of other beers other than theirs on tap, which tells me they really want to please their customers and it's true, variety is the spice of life. I think visually, the bar is very mechanical. You could see where all the pipes lead and the colors are pretty metallic, which I do feel is somewhat of a disconnect there and lack of cohesion because the restaurant is very luxurious and modern. The drinks do take a while to come out to you, so be prepared to wait around 10 mins if you're not sitting at the bar.As for the food, it's very good. They have probably the best chicken nachos anywhere and the onion ring tower is toe to toe with the blooming onion of Outback Steakhouse. I do suggest only coming here during lunch hour and late night because everything on those specific menus are a bargain! The service is just kinda blah. The hosts are pretty bland. You don't get that warm welcome you do at a Cheesecake Factory, it's more like a hello and welcome from an Applebee's lol. For the most part, all the employees are just okay, but I wish I could light a fire under a lot of them to put some excitement on their faces.

The one in Santana Row is the fifth location I've visited. The YH, regardless of where it is, always has a massive beer selection, decent food (their appetizers trump their entrees) good staff and plenty of opportunities for people watching - these are the reasons why I love them. I went last night (Friday) at around 9:30 and they were packed. They don't take reservations but you should call them on your way there so they put your name on the list - worked for us. We were seated 5 minutes after we showed up. Niceeeeee!Atmosphere:Cool. Clean. Loud. That's how all YHs are. I think it's also the reason most people come back. It's weird, it's one of the only places where you can wear either jeans and a tshirt or business casual and not feel under or overdressed. Their atmosphere welcomes all! Food:I've dined at YH plenty of times. Stick to their appetizers. Most of them are great except for the artichoke dip with crab - I don't believe cheese and seafood make a good couple unless you're talking about a tuna melt. Drinks:Biggest selection of beer you'll find this side of the Mississippi and a full bar with top-shelf liquor. The bar is huge - the signature elongated oval bar every YH has. Try to find bar seating if you're looking to mingle with strangers and make new friends.Service:Always the same - good to great but not amazing. The servers are cool, they don't overly check on you asking how everything is going every 10 minutes. They're always nice. I've never had an issue with YHs service at any location. Price:Not bad at all. Last night my date and I shared an appetizer, she had a pint of beer and I had two Sapphire and tonics. The bill came out to be $38 before tip.YHs is a great place for big parties, first dates, people watching, sports fans and beer enthusiasts.

But instead it was served with crispy flat bread (guess I should've read the description). Anyways I thought that the spinach dip was just alright I think that the dip itself is a bit greasy and having it with the flatbread made it a bit greasier.

After a while, all the guests arrived, but I was basically full. Despite that, I managed to eat half of my turkey sandwich and being the rest home.Based on my two experiences, I suggest going for the appetizers because it makes a good compliment to the good company and the sports scene.

Happy hour is Mon-Fri from 3-6 and late night on Sun-Wed from 10-close! BBQ pizza: My favorite thing to get here. It's half off so a whole pizza is about $6!! I love the bbq sauce that they use, it reminds me of an asian taste and it just makes the pizza taste soooo good. Chicken Nachos: Another favorite to get here...and its HUGE! Generous portions of guac/sourcream/chicken/beans. Hawaiin Poke Stack: Great portion as well. Comes with 2 pieces of wonton chips stacked with poke and slices of avocado. Highly recommend if you want something that isn't too oily. Spicy Tuna Roll: This was okay, I got sick of the tuna after a while and there was a bit too much edamame compared to the rest of the dish on here as well. Spinach Cheese Dip: This is soo good as well. Comes out hot and fresh and you can always ask for more chips if you run out! There's also such a wide selection of drinks I can't even begin to say which I've tried. But remember that you can always sample drinks before you get them!

I had recently turned 21 so my sister took me out for drinks after dinner on a Wednesday night. I love that their happy hour is so late because we were able to have our dinner without rushing ourselves and make our way to Yardhouse. Service: Luckily we were seated within 5 minutes and I was surprised at how many people were around on a Wednesday night! Regardless we were seated at a nice booth. We had to flag down a waiter because there was so much going on around us that we weren't even sure that our waiter knew that we needed to be served. Once we asked a waiter, our actual server came over right after and walked us through the menu. She even recommended her favorite drinks and food which was really sweet considering how many people she was probably tending to on this busy night. Our drinks and food came out very promptly and she came by to let us know when last call was too, which was helpful especially if you're not sitting near the bar. Drinks: I had the Southern Bell (jeremiah weed sweet tea vodka, lemonade, fresh strawberries and pineapple) which was a really sweet, lemonade tasting drink. There was VERY little alcohol which was fine because the lemonade was delicious and I just couldn't stop sipping on my drink. I also loved the fresh fruit in the drink as well, they added great flavor! My sister ordered the Strawberry Fields martini which was a little stronger, but from what I remember I enjoyed my taste of it! Food: We ordered a chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream to go with our drinks. Pretty much like a normal pizookie but better because it was a brownie. The brownie was cooked perfectly and was soft and gooey too--heavenly! I will definitely be returning! I loved the vibe of the place--it was upbeat, had great music, and I had a great time. It also wasn't too loud, so you could have an actual conversation. This is a big plus, especially if you go with one other person, you want to be able to hear them!!

Won't be coming back.Off all my experiences at Yardhouse, from my days when I lived in Irvine to now when it was brought to my hometown, I've never had such a negative experience after facing such a discriminatory act.Came here about a week ago when our party wanted to watch the Superbowl. I called a few days before just to check on the seating process for the big day. I was told that for a party of 6 or more, a majority of our party had to be present. The day of, only 4 out of our total party of 9 were present at first, as some folks were running late. We were told to wait but that there was no guarantee that we would get a table unless ALL of our party showed up. So they told us to wait. And so we waited. And waited. And waited. After a great amount of time waiting we were finally seated. HOWEVER...once seated, we noticed a party seated at a large table next to us with only 2 people. They were waiting for the rest of their party to show up too. And yet, they were seated WAY before us. Within an hour, the rest of our party showed up and yet this supposed \"large\" party next to us still remained at 2 people. Their whole party didn't show up until HOURS later. REALLY?!! FYI, we were a group of diverse people while this other party was, well let's just say, more privileged looking.We spoke up to the manager, mind you a white male, about this unfairness. When we mentioned that it was racist he rolled his eyes and completely ignored us. What person in their right mind would ignore a customer?! Obviously, he would. When the host, another white male, overheard the conversation, he stated that people lie all the time about their numbers for large parties. Hmm...I wonder what type of \"people\" he was referring to. Let's just say nothing was done about it. Plus, we couldn't help but notice that other privileged looking large tables around us composed of smaller parties. They were seated in large booths when there were only 2 or 3 of them. And that a bunch of other \u00a0possible large parties near the door were left waiting. I'm sorry but I refuse to come back to a place that lacks employees who aren't culturally competent, especially if it's management.

The most recent being for a group of 14 last week. I really can't remember much about the first lunch, but it went well enough for everyone to want to go back again. They have every type of beer you can think of on tap which is nice. Their menu is a mile long and is similar to the Cheesecake Factory in the way that it makes it hard to choose what to eat. But at least you know there should be something for everyone.I set up our reservation and ordered our appetizers ahead of time so those of us who arrived at the restaurant on time could snack on something while waiting for the stragglers to show up (+1 start because only 50% of your party needs to be present to be seated). I never understand why people can't get to a group lunch on time. It's not like it's a dinner reservation and we can take our time (not that I condone being late for dinner reservations either) But we do unfortunately need to go back to work at a reasonable time.We had two orders each of the California Roll, Calamari and Crab Cakes. They were all delicious and averaged about $12 each. The CA roll isn't a typical sushi roll but a large serving formed with a ring mold. You end up slicing it like a pie. Interesting concept and tastes fine, but with a group sharing it turns into a mess.As for my main mean, I had a caesar salad and half roast beef dip sandwich. Both were really bad. Really, really bad. The salad had a TON of grated parmesean cheese mixed in the dressing and tossed in the salad. Maybe it would have helped to order the dressing on the side. But there was just so much cheese it created an awful texture and it was really off-putting. The roast beef was very lack luster and flavorless. It also had a really unpleasant texture and the au jus was just missing something. I took a couple bites of both and then just pushed it aside.Lastly, I ordered two mini dessert samplers with mini serving of lemon souffl\u00e9, peach apple cobbler and chocolate souffl\u00e9. I didn't like any of it. Unlike the Cheesecake Factory, this place does not bring their A-game out for dessert.

I had heard that this place has delicious food and was a little skeptical because it seems more of a bar, but I was definitely proven wrong. I've been here once with my coworkers and I just went here last night.Foodwise, let me start out by saying that I love the way the menu is broken up. They have an entire vegetarian menu for all you veggies out there, along with little symbols of what is under 600 calories and vegetarian items throughout the menu. It's also broken up by pizzas, burgers, sandwiches, house favorites, seafood, and more. They list out all their beers and have a TON to choose from - they're known for their beers, incase you didn't know that. When you look at the bar, you'll see a huuuuuge row of them all on tap which is pretty amazing. Anyway, on the menu itself, they have a list of \"skinny cocktails\" which I love - I've gotten the pure cosmo martini, and all the cocktails under there are 150-200 calories. The first time I went with coworkers, we came for happy hour after work and ordered a bunch of beer and appetizers. For happy hour, they have a lot of really great deals and you can get a bunch of cheap stuff. I forgot the prices, but it's so well-priced and we got a ton of stuff and it was only maybe $20/person, including drinks.The second time I came was with one other friend for dinner, and we had a hard time deciding what to get because the menu is massive. Their selection is just so amazing that it's difficult to narrow down what you want (because you really want everything!) but we ended up sharing: the poke tuna tower (so delicious and is highly recommended by them!), chicken strips (these were good, but not anything special), and the chicken enchilada stack (so so so yummy - we weren't sure how well they could do Mexican food and were pleasantly surprised by it). There were so many other things I wanted to get on the menu but I'll have to save them for other times.The staff is really nice and friendly. Even on a Friday night with millions of people here, they have the place very under control. The nice thing is, we were able to call in advance and put our name down without being there which was clutch. I love the setup and vibe of the place.

We must have gone through at least 3 servings of truffle fries, and I could probably have eaten 3 more. *Spicy Calamari - Some calamari went by to another table, and we knew we HAD to have our own batch! That other group knew what they were doing, because that calamari was lightly battered.* Hawaiian Poke Stack - I'm always a fan of poke, especially when drinking. It always seems a perfect balance to alcohol, not sure why!* Turkey Burger Sliders - Okay on taste, but a little dry.* Chicken Garlic Noodles - I thought these were also just okay.

Not a huge deal but kind of annoying when you want your drink and everyone else has theirs already. The food ... oh my god, I was pleasantly surprised I ordered the Pepper Crusted Gorgonzola burger and it was SUPER good! Another person in my party ordered the Shepard's Pie and the thing was the size of a medium pizza! As with most Shepard's Pie's, it's mostly pastry but even taking that into consideration, this is the biggest single serving of Shepard's Pie I have ever seen and I was told it was really good. No complaints on the rest of the food either. Since I was there at 2pm in the afternoon and driving, I can't say that I was able to try too many of their beers. I did enjoy the House Honey Blond though. Overall, I was happy with the service, food and beer and the most important thing is that my son had a good birthday.

He apologized, said it was obviously a mistake ($73 for two beers and appetizer?), the signature on the receipt didn't match mine, and I'd be refunded in full in about 5 working days. Okay, no harm done.About a week later, I'd not gotten the refund, but I did get a call from the general manager who identified himself as \"Bobby\".

Because happy hour exists. -No matter when you're here, order the tomato bisque.Happy Hour & Late NightMonday - Friday 3pm - 6pm Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - CloseDrink Specials:Shortys $2.25 - $4.50Domestic Pints $3.50Craft/Import Pints $4.25 - $5.00Goblets $4.75 - $5.50Half Yards (M-F, 3-6 only) $7.00 - $10.00Well Drinks $4.25 - $4.75House Martinis $6.25Specialty Drinks $2.00 offWine By The Glass $2.00 offPlus: Many 1/2 priced appetizersThe drinks are pleasantly strong, the beer selection is overwhelming, and I've found that the food is mediocre, with the exception of the tomato bisque.

It was really nice on the inside, so modern and pretty. The hostess didn't seem really friendly she just stared and said \"how many people.\" Okay,wait. Um, thanks for the smile.When we got seated our server came and immediately asked us if we wanted anything to drink or if we wanted to order any starters. We decided on the fried clamari as our starter. Thank you god we got a nice server. When he came back with our drinks we were ready to order. My mom got the FIsh &Chips and I got the Garlic Lobster Noodles ( I wanted to see what all the rave was about). Fried Calamari- The fried calamari was pretty good. It wasn't oily at all, and the two dipping sauces they gave you really helped enhance the flavors. We got two different kind of sauces, tarter sauce and I believe mozarella sauce. Either way the calmari tasted good and even better when I dipped it in both the tarter sauce and mozarella sauce. I didn't really notice it was oily until I got to the bottom of the basket, but even when I reached the end there was only a small amount of oil.Fish &Chips- I don't know if my mom really enjoyed the Fish &Chips. While she said it was good she only ate 1/4 of the fishes they gave on the platter. The fries they gave with her fish were out of this world \u00a0they gave her a lot of fries and I kept picking off her plate because it was so good. Okay,back to the FIsh.. I got to taste the fish and I thought while the fish was good, the batter on the out side was to thick. I would really prefer it with less of the batter.Garlic Lobster Noodles- I wanted to see what all the rave about these garlic lobster noodles were about. This plate was pretty good, I don't know if its good to a point where I would get it again, but it was pretty good. I loved the shrimp and the lobster on this plate. My personal perference of the noodles were that they were seasoned why to much. My mom really really really liked my dish, I couldn't finish it after eating only half and she finished it for me. She liked my lobster noodles, she said it was different and good.My first experience at Yard House was fairly good, I would totally come back and give it another try. If you didn't notice by now my mom and I got the calamari, fish and chips, and lobster garlic noodles, all of those dishes were seafood. :) Next time when I come, I'll be sure to try pasta, burgers, crab cakes, and anything else that catches my eye.NOTE: My mom and I came in at around 12:30 and there wasn't a wait.

COUNT ME IN!I've always loved Yardhouses happy hour menu just because it's good food for cheap. Around 10pm, my friends and I met up at Santana Row to start heading over. Since it was too busy, we were able to get a table for 4 without any trouble.Our server quickly helped us out with our drink orders and I decided to get a Hawaiian Sunset martini since it was on the happy hour menu. Soon after our drink orders were place, we went ahead and ordered our food. Since I was craving seafood, I got the Poke Stack along with the chicken garlic noodles with no mushrooms. While my other friends got gardein pizza, barbeque chicken pizza, pear gorgonzola flatbread and chips with guacamole. While our food was in the process of being made, our drink orders came out. I was excited to have my drink since it looked so yummy. The Hawaiian Sunset was a drink that consisted of Cherry skyy vodka, pineapple malibu rum, dekuyper island punch and razzmatazz. This literally is the best mixed I've ever had! It straight up taste like candy and the alcohol taste is so subtle (I hate the taste of most alcohol). The HS drink will also leave you a little buzzed too, at least for me lol. 10 minutes after, our food finally arrived! I was so excited to eat since finals were over and that I haven't eaten all day. Anyways, I was super excited to eat the poke since I've been craving it for weeks! After the first bite of my poke stack, I realized I was going to hate the entire thing. For some reason, each bite was super bitter compared to the last time I got it. I think it's because of the daikon (which I clearly don't remember it being it there.) I'm pretty sure they switched out the bean sprouts for daikon recently. Though, the ahi tuna was fresh tasting, the daikon in there just ruined the entire dish for me. As for the chicken garlic noodles, it never failed to satisfy me! The noodles were cooked on point and had a nice buttery texture to it. The edamame added a nice chewy crunch to it and the chicken was yummy as usual. Though all my friends and I got our own plates to eat, my friend Lucy gave me one of her pear gorgonzola flatbreads to try. The physical look of the flatbread kind of reminded me of Pizza Antica's pear pizza that they have on the menu. Sadly, it didn't measure up. The bread had a weird texture to it, the pear wasn't sweet and the entire flatbread was just bland. Bummer that the food didn't taste too well this time but I'll probably comeback and avoid certain items on the menu or take out certain ingredients. Other than that, I'll be back!PS: Definitely order the Hawaiian Sunset!

The service can lag a bit when the place is packed, but the enormous beer selection more than makes up for it.

If you stick with the basics you probably won't be disappointed. I've enjoyed the burgers, sandwiches, soups and fries, but didn't particularly like the calamari and found the California roll kind of bizarre. Instead of a traditional sushi roll, the California roll comes as a big rice cake that you need to eat with a knife and fork. It tastes more or less like a typical California roll, but the presentation is strange and a bit off putting. I definitely recommend a visit to Yard House for the beer selection alone.

We say no, and barely 5-10 minutes later, another table of 6 get sat a table away from us. Okay...so how are they going to order their food if THE KITCHEN IS CLOSING?!

Highly recommend the fries - SO good! I could barely keep from shoveling them in my mouth (ummm drunchies, much?) Another thing that I was seriously impressed with was the sheer size of the menu. I mean, my god, the first 3 pages were just beers! It was almost overwhelming, especially because literally, everything on it sounded amazing. Also, with such a diverse menu (everything from pizza and wings to Asian fusion) - I can't imagine anyone in your party would have difficulty finding something to suit their taste. With that being said, Yard House is GREAT for GROUPS! Prices are set right at the cusp of pushing the slightly pricy level, but are ok to where you'll feel ok ordering. Props to them, as they can just barely get away with charging $8 for some yummy sounding craft beers. Lastly, thank goodness they have happy hour, and I love that it starts up again at 10.

For someone who is looking for some American grub and beer, this is the spot for you. \u00a0They have over 100 beers on tap (s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com\u2026) for you to choose from.

However I really didn't care too much for the turkey meat, which was a bit bland and on the dry side.The highlight was the Pineapple Express, which is blended with sky infusion pineapple vodka, malibu pineapple rum, monin mojito syrup, fresh pineapple, and fresh mint leaves. Wow, this drink was quite refreshing and delicious. It had me ordering a few more after the first one. =PScene:Atmosphere is too quiet with elevator music, making this place not geared for football fans. For starters, Yard House isn't open until 11:00am, while football kickoff is 10:00am. Normally you can hear the main game, but instead you hear elevator music in the background. Also there is no real excitement here during the games. Don't get me wrong, Yard House is a really nice place for the casual drinker or someone walking around Santa Row. This is just not the place for someone who mainly wants to watch some football games.Summary (3 Stars): Yard House is a good spot to hang out with friends to drink beer and eat food.

The entrance overlooks the bar and lower dining room area. All areas are stroller- and wheelchair-accessible. The acoustics were good during my visit and the place looks like it could get loud when busy. The ceiling is a wad of shadowy fire sprinkler plumbing, duct work, speakers, and Unistrut. There is a scattered array of televisions.At the bar on the first visit, there was a good looking male+female couple, each with a jumbo, turbine-engine-case-shaped beer glass. The woman wore a tank top, khaki shorts, and a just-back-from-Burning-Man tan. Not that I was looking. (Lucky couple.) \"What do you call those drinks?\" I asked my server. \"A Yard,\" she answered. Imagine a tall glass with a capacity two point five time your bladder's. They drank two each. Their immediate future would include peeing and giggling. If I were not driving, a Yard would've been on my tab. I wonder, \"How the heck do you shoehorn those glasses into the dish machine?\" The menu has a wide variety including vegetarian items and some items identified as under 600 calories. Most menu items have neither of these markings. On my first visit, I tried the ginger-crusted Norwegian salmon with garlic mashed potatoes, (US$27). Order this and I think you'll be pleased. Next visit, I opted for the Cuban Pork Dip sandwich, (US$14). It's made with crispy, thin Cuban bread. I wanted to try this baked product once even though authentic Cuban bread is usually made with lard. The sandwich arrived with pencil-thin french fries fanned out like an agave in a paper-lined, stainless steel cup.

My friend and I opt to hang out around the bar area until a spot opened up at the bar top. Luckily, we managed to order some beer as we were waiting and honestly, I don't even remember how long we were waiting, but it didn't seem that long until a spot opened up. We were too busy chatting and people watching to even notice how much time had passed. It was probably half an hour to an hour?Well anyway, I got to try the following beers that night:- House Amber Ale- Anderson Valley Boont Amber Ale- Timmerman's Strawberry- Lost Coast Apricot Wheat- Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat- Delirium Tremens- Spaten Optimator- Great WhiteIt was really fun trying all of the beers. My favorites were the ambers, Timmerman's Strawberry, and the Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat. The Timmerman's Strawberry didn't even taste like beer, it's fermented in a way that made the predominant flavor strawberry. I honestly felt like I was drinking strawberry soda, it was pretty cool! The Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat was also fun to drink. My friend had me take a sip and told me to tell her what I thought and I honestly thought about Fruity Pebbles cereal--no joke! I also want to talk about the Delirium Tremens. It was a very complex spiced Belgian strong ale that I didn't like very much, but I had to try it because it's logo was an elephant. I love elephants!Yeah, I know...I did a lot of drinking, but that actually wasn't all we drank. I also tried the Southern Belle, Tuaca Berry Blast, Pomegranate Press, and the Strawberry Fields. The Southern Belle was similar to the Southern Punch that I tried the first time; however, it had vodka instead of rum and it had a lot of chunks of strawberry and pineapple. The other drinks and martinis that I tried were no bueno. They were either alcohol-laden or tasted like cough syrup.We also shared an order of the house favorite, mac and cheese, and an order of chicken lettuce wraps. I can understand why the mac and cheese (yelp.com/biz_photos/MRlH\u2026) is a house favorite. It is the best mac and cheese ever! It had earthy mushrooms that complemented the smoked bacon, chicken breast, and cheese so well. The finishing touch of toasted bread crumbs was amazing! I wish I could say the same for the chicken lettuce wraps. The wraps were just too greasy and I'm usually not a fan of butter lettuce.The next time I went, I went on a Saturday afternoon and the wait was 40 minutes. I didn't try any new beers, but I got to try the truffle fries, onion ring tower, and the walnut pear salad. Everything was absolutely delicious! The truffle fries were super thin, but tender and moist. The beer battered onion rings (yelp.com/biz_photos/MRlH\u2026) were great with the chipotle and ranch dips. The walnut pear salad came with fresh pears and the mixed greens were drizzled with bleu cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. The candied walnuts added texture to the salad, which I liked.This has got to be one of the longest reviews I've written in a long time, but Yard House deserves it.

I guess happy hour it is!We arrived Yard House around 5pm? \u00a0There was a good amount of traffic inside the restaurant. \u00a0This was my boyfriend and my very first time to actually sit down at a Yard House. \u00a0Notice they have a huge amount of beer on tap in the center where the bar is located! \u00a0They have booths lining around the restaurant and with tables filling the middle section. \u00a0We were brought to a booth that overlooks the street right across from Valley Fair.We sat down and took some time with the menu. \u00a0Since it was happy hour, I believe ( if i dont remember wrong), appetizers were half off. \u00a0They also have a large selection of beer (needless to say). \u00a0The beer menu was so attractive that I took more time deciding what to get to drink, instead of what to eat. \u00a0We finally settled with 4 dishes of appetizers, which happen to become way too much!The Crab and artichoke dip with pita bread - served with about 10 slices of pita bread with chips accompanying around it. \u00a0The crab dip was delightful and not too heavy. \u00a0This was one of my favorite. \u00a0The following picture shows food half eaten up : yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026The chicken nachos - OMG! This was huge! (thats what she said..haha) \u00a0We did not expect to receive this huge plate of nachos if they were called appetizers. \u00a0However, the plate was filled with nacho chips with a generous amount of sour cream and guac. \u00a0Salsa and beans were incorporated for flavor. \u00a0The dish was not spicy at all, but very flavorful. Liked it! yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026The crab cakes - served in an large plate with 2 pieces. \u00a0The presentation of this dish was very elegant. \u00a0The crab cakes was a tad bit disappointing because I thought it was a bit too dry. \u00a0However, if you cut out small pieces and dip it into the sauce around it, it will taste better. \u00a0texture-wise, I think it needs some work, but overall, not bad. \u00a0yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026Lastly, we also ordered the buffalo wings. \u00a0The dish had at least 10 wings in there with ranch sauce in the middle. \u00a0There was also some celery and carrot sticks on the side. \u00a0The buffalo wings weren't bad. \u00a0Afterall, I love my buffalo wings with ranch sauce! Plus celery stick with ranch? yum!For drinks, our table probably ordered over 5 different beers, which included the Black Velvet ( guiness + champagne). \u00a0If you have not tried this combo, give it a go the next time you're there! Our friend loved it. \u00a0They also have a bunch of wheat ale if you're not a fan of hard stuff, but you like bluemoon. \u00a0Servers are real nice and friendly. \u00a0They take the time with your orders and your food some all at once. \u00a0Thank you Yard House for such a wonderful first time experience. \u00a0I am already planning on coming back with more of my friends.p.s. if you're not interested in dining, the bar definitely fills up around 6pm!", "Date": "2011-08-09", "Author_Location": "Millbrae, CA"}, {"Author": "Malley D.", "ReviewID": "ZmQrpTdsoKPyZPmDDLM3mg", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This place is AWFUL!!!

The rest of the food is decent, but nothing particularly special. The biggest turn off about this place is the excruciating wait times which could take hours. I've given up many times trying to get a table here and just end up leaving and going someplace else. There are plenty of TVs here to enjoy the game.

Grab something to drink and maybe some popcorn. Ready? Ok..So unlike everyone else and their mom, I have never been to the Yard House ever. And what I mean by that is, I never went to ones in SoCal. Haha. I was pretty interested in trying it out since I've heard so much about it, so I got a chance last night (the Monday right after their busy opening weekend) to check it out with some of my friends.I called in twice that day, to check if they had a waitlist and what they expected the wait times to be throughout the day. They were quick to pick up the phone and I believe had more than one person answering calls to accommodate everyone.Note 1: They will allow you to call in ahead to be put on the waitlist 30 minutes ahead of the time you come in if you have a party of 6 or less. If you have a party larger than 6, you have to come in and talk to the manager in order to be put on the waitlist.We had a group of 10, so one of my friends gets there around 8pm and was told the wait was about an hour and a half and tells him to come back to check in and gives him a buzzer.Note 2: It will be faster if you don't mind being split up into 2 tables. I would recommend going here will a smaller party of no more than 6 because their booths can hold that much and you probably can get seated sooner.We didn't mind waiting or walking around Santana Row, so we did that and checked in after an hour and then waited around outside and eventually got seated around 9:30 but our group was split into two tables, but they were side by side.Our server was really nice. The food comes out quick! Unfortunately they were out of a lot of taps, but it was ok bc we were still able to try a couple things.Here is a list of what I tried that night (might seem like I have a large appetite, but don't forget we had a party of 10! Had plenty of plates to share. ;) )Courses:Loaded Mac and Cheese: Really good. I especially loved the mushrooms in this dish! And this was big enough to share for 3 people per plate.Appetizers:Spicy Tuna Roll: This aint no roll, this is like a huge tartare! Chicken Lettuce Wraps: Yummy and served with 3 different kinds of dipping sauces.Crab Cakes: Comes with 2 cakes, and they are crispy on the outside and they don't skimp on the meat! This came with some sauce on the plate and some mango salsa. Probably one of my favorite dishes of the night.Poke Stack: I say this is good size for the happy hour price, but I think the poke from Hukilau is better. Also comes with a good amount of julienned carrots, bean sprouts, and some avocado on the side.Beers/Drinks:House Honey Blonde: Standard light beer. I wouldn't order it again though, probably would get a Hef instead of this.Young's Double Chocolate Stout: If Guinness and Dark chocolate had a baby, this would be it.Delirium Tremens: Has a good taste in the beginning, but definitely had a kick in the end. Strawberry something: Reminds me of Capri sun. An alcoholic bubbly strawberry Capri Sun. If that sounds good to you, try it! I liked it.Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat: A refreshing light beer. Would probably order this again.Pomegranate Press: Really good. Fruity and light, but this is probably one of those creeper drinks you will feel after a couple.Southern Punch: Super good also! Another fruity mix.Although service was pretty solid throughout the night and food came out surprisingly quicker than expected, at the end they did take a little while to give us our bill. But listen up: They have no problem splitting the bills. At one table of 6, we split the bill 3 ways, and in the beginning we shared 2 plates of Mac and cheese. The server was able to split the 2 plates of Mac and cheese 3 ways! That is AWESOME. Makes it much easier for the rest of us who lack the want or ability to do math after some drinking.In the end: The food, service, and drinks were really solid. They have plenty of space at the bar and a lot of screens to catch something to watch or sports. I don't know if it's worth the 1.5hr + wait, but then again, you're in Santana Row, and you have plenty of places to check out and space to walk around to kill time. This place kind of reminds me of a much better BJ's. I would definitely come back for happy hour though. I think the price points there are very affordable for the amount and quality of food that you get. (The Monday right after their opening day, happy hour didn't look too crazy busy.

There should be a rule that everyone who goes there for the first time get a half yard. It's equivalent to a little more than 2 beers, and it just looks cool like the skinny flask with a bulb. How can you go to yard house and not have a yard stick right?Food:I think the truffle oil fries are overrated. But if you want to try it, you can order it on the side of a burger and they just charge u a little and u get a cup full which is more than enough.My favorite dishes there;-Garlic noodles!!! So addicting. Good both as appetizer or entree. -Jambalaya: waiter recommended it, it's awesome-Surf and turf burger. Soooo good! For $15, it has lobster and a burger patty with asparagus in it. Such a delicious combo!!!!-Lobster crab dip: delicious but it comes in a huge plate so be wary, it's better for bigger parties to share-Truffle Mac n cheese- pretty good. It's different Today we also tried desserts- mini lemon souffle, macadamia nut cheesecake, and kona ice cream. All were decent but really really heavy. I think that all the food at yard house is pretty heavy (unless u get a salad... But who does that????!) it's cool to come here to drink beer and eat, but the food isn't exceptional, the lines are long and I think it's pretty noisy. At like 7pm, they dimmed the lights too.

The ahi roll was good, but it was literally a big chunk of ahi tuna surrounded by avocado and edamame. My salad was not a salad at all, but mixed veggies (corn, tomatoes, celery) and bacon with avocado on top. It was good, but not what I was expecting. I also tried the sweet potatoe fries, which we pretty amazing. I ushually like a spicy mustard sauce, bute YH offers a more cinnamon flavored dipping sauce. YUM!

I probably WON'T be coming back here for about a year. Part of 12. We came at 3:30pm on a Sunday and they said \"Hour and a Half wait!\". We thought that wasn't bad at all so they took down our number so we could walk around Santana Row till our table is ready. Hour and a half passes. We called Yardhouse to see the status of our table. They said \"Sorry, the big group that is still at the table just ordered another round of beers. We're assuming another 45 minutes.\" Ok Ok.. We all agreed that its understandable that people MIGHT want to drink more (duh). 45 minutes pass... We call in and they say \"Party of what? It will be a hour to a hour and a half.\"SO.. We go over to yardhouse. I think they gave our table away (I think). We waited for another hour when they insured us that our table was NOT given away... After 3 hours they finally tried to \"bargain\" with us and sat us right by the front door where other people kept trying to sit down because they thought it was the waiting area. Whatever.. 3 hour wait fine.. whatever.. If we knew it would take us 2 hours to get our food we would of left after the first call when they told us to wait another 45 minutes.Food was cold, burgers were soggy AND beer never came out. We didn't leave yardhouse till 8:45pm when we initially got there at 3:30pm.The only reason why I'm giving this place something other then a 1 star is because the management was pretty on top of everything.

I was expecting to love the food here after reading the reviews but this place is a little over hyped. I got the avocado burger with cheese along with the truffle fries that so many people have raved about. The burger was too well done and was just OK. There was a lot of fresh avocado on it though. The fries were shoestring fries and I've had much better fries elsewhere. The truffle oil just made the fries taste oily. I also got the gobstopper cocktail which was sweet and tart. That wasn't bad. They have a very extensive list of wine, beer, and cocktails. The lady next to us got the sea bass and it looked so good that even my husband said that he'd like to try that next time and he doesn't really like seafood except for eating the clams in clam chowder. This place is an Asian fusion place that also has lots of different kinds of good old American comfort food. They even have Jambalaya. They have an eclectic mix of Thai, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese food. I should've gotten one of their more exotic dishes. We also got the onion ring tower which is kind of on the small side for the appetizer. The onion rings are on a steel rod and were just OK. The prices of the food here is fairly inexpensive. My dish cost around $12.00 I think. This place is new and located right in the corner of Santa Row facing Stevens Creek Blvd. Parking is hard to find so like I said, the earlier you come here, the better as Santa Row is usually even more packed later in the day.

Honestly, I thought it was pretty funny, but I'm pretty sure somebody would take that the wrong way, such as crappy service skills. Also, the server helped my table out, but he didn't really take a liking to one of my friends and I feel that he intentionally skipped on refilling her water but asked the rest of my friends when her half-empty glass was right in front of him. Furthermore, before all of this happened when I attempted to be seated for a table of five, the hostess told me to wait patiently, but I felt that they were also acting \"chill\".

One of the things I missed about living in SoCal were the restaurants, especially this place. 3 years later, at least one restaurant decided to follow me back up north. Well, Five Guys eventually made its way here, but thats another story. I got into the soft opening by emailing corporate headquarters and asking for an invite. They online rep emailed me back shortly, and even honored my request to add a +4 to my name for their guestlist. The private event lasted from 5-8, and I regret showing up at 7! Bah, but I had a good experience for my first soft opening party. After checking in at the entrance, the hostess handed out 2 free drink vouchers per person, which was good for at least til 830pm. The space inside is pretty reasonable, just like the other Yard Houses that I have been to. But wow, people were all over the place. Waiters were everywhere offering samples of their appetizers. I got to try the chicken penne pasta, blue crab cakes, Hawaiian pizza, korean bbq beef, and creme brulee. Best part was being able to take as much as you wanted. I've only had their sandwiches and burgers here, but all of appetizers I sampled were cooked just right. Honestly, my favorite was the creme brulee, and prior to last night, I've never had it before. Later on when the restaurant was open to the public, I had a turkey melt. Wasn't too greasy, a little spicy (which was nice), and \u00a0a generous serving of french fries. The only about getting a lot of samples was already having a beer in your hand and not having a table. I'll get to the latter in a bit. Having over 100+ beers on tap, its truly like being a kid in a candy store. My first drink was Leinenkugel's sunset wheat. Its my favorite beer of all time, probably because it tastes like fruity pebbles. For my second drink, I asked for a recommendation for someone who likes Blue Moon and sunset wheat, and the bartender suggested a Speakeasy beer, which is based out of San Francisco. Liked the taste, but it was a subtle version of what I was seeking. Anyway, 2 beers down, 120-something to go. So as I said earlier, place was packed. I probably waited over 2 hours til I finally ended up at a table, but that required a lot of roaming around to see if people were leaving. You know, just like looking for parking when you're at the mall during the holiday season. I did however, enjoy the service. Friendly waiters, reasonable service, and attentive bartenders made the experience of waiting for tables a lot better though. Judging from the way things went, I plan on being a regular here.

But the waitress said, you should get in by then. \u00a0Then we decided to wait. When we sat down, it was 6:00pm. It took me about 5 minutes to look at the menu, and when we were going to order happy hour's menu, we were told it was over already. And we told the waiter what we'd been told when we signed up to wait. Then the waiter asked who said that to us, we didn't pay attention to that waitress' name. Later, the supervisor came up, and spoke loudly to us that nobody here would promise or guarantee what time you could get a table, no way. It was like we wanted to take advantage of it. Despite how we explained, that supervisor (she) kept saying blah blah loudly. We got very mad about that type of attitude and decided to leave. And I WILL DEFINITELY SHARE THIS STORY WITH ALL MY FRIENDS, FAMILIES AND COMPANY COWORKERS ABOUT 200 ~ 300 PEOPLE. Don't and NEVER choose here for happy hour or party lunch/dinner or any company activities. At lease for my side, they do lose the business already.

Being located in Santana Row, the feel and decor of this location is more trendy and high tech. You can see the metal tubing to the beer tanks upstairs and there are tons of TVs all around. This place is always packed- so don't come unless you are ready to wait at least 60-90 minutes! & forget about waiting at the bar... those slots are always full too. However, I do enjoy the food more than your typical brewery or chain restaurant, and the menu for alcoholic drinks & food is so extensive I never get bored! The best improvement Yardhouse has made is serving Gardein vegetarian \"meat\"!!!!! They have fake chicken & beef so no longer do I have to choose between 1 of 2 vegetarian items on a menu or pay the full price for something that has the meat taken out. I can have anything I want & sub in my vegetarian protein! Their Gardein \"chicken\" is tasty, & they grill it wonderfully. My favorite dishes here are the garlic noodles, deviled eggs, truffle fries, & the BBQ \"chicken\" salad.", "Date": "2013-01-16", "Author_Location": "Austin, TX"}, {"Author": "Ashley T.", "ReviewID": "aNnp8BLVqo_H4Z5J6u0pVQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The star of Yard House is BEER!BEER, BEER, BEER! What other reason do you have to come here? Seriously?I've tried about a dozen of the beers. I can't remember them all by name but what's the point? Im not done trying them all.. And well if I saw the menu, I know which beer I last tried. I love their brown ale, rogue hazelnut brown nectar! I recommend you to try it if you like dark beers and hazelnut. Another one of my favorite beers is a blended beer, eclipse. It's a combination of blue moon and guiness stout. It looks pretty cool in a half yard, there's one distinct layer of blue moon and another layer of guiness, but when you drink it you get the mix of both. Fruity beers aren't on the top of my list but there are a few good ones and I've tried a lot of them because... my friend's like them a lot.-The Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry is delicious, they usually run out of this. Taste like blue moon with blueberries.-Another one that is quite popular is Timmerman's Strawberry that taste like strawberry cider. They won't serve this to you in the half yard because it has a higher alcohol content. -Lost Coast Apricot wheat, it taste like a sweet wheat with light hints of apricot. -If you like floats you should try lindeman's framboisewith vanilla ice cream. Taste like raspberry soda float and it will get you buzzed. -My favorite fruity beer is probably going to be Rose Gaarden, it's a blended beer that combines hoegaarden white and lindeman's framboise. Everyone think's it taste like a fruity pebble beer. Their food is usually too salty for me. I do love that they have a whole vegetarian/vegan section. I have my days where I like to eat vegetarian. -Shrimp ceviche spoons are one of the few things I like to snack on here, fresh and zesty.Small portion enough for just one person.-Seared Ahi Sashimi was a disappointment compared to the one I tried in Vegas. It was way too salty and the texture was really dry all of the times I ordered it.-Chinese garlic noodles are good but over salted. I usually share this, it \u00a0is made with thin noodles, shitake mushrooms, garlic, parmesan cheese, and oil. -Onion ring towers are a must, they're probably the only things on the appetizer menu that is made without excess salt.-Blue crab cakes can be skipped. They don't use fresh blue crab and it taste more like a croquette than a creamy crab cake. -If you order the california roll, it's probably something you aren't expecting. It's a single california roll blown up to the size of your fist. If you really like california rolls, you'll like this. It can get bland and gross after a while. Ask for sriracha if you like spicy-Hawaiian poke stack is okay, generic poke stack. It's a deal during happy hour.- The classic ranch appetizer salad is probably my favorite salad to get. The classic ranch salad has the whole shabang, not just iceberg lettuce and ranch dressing. Who drinks beer and eats salad? ME! It helps rehydrate me after drinking all those beers.-Veggie truffle oil mac and cheese. THUMBS UP! Rich cheesy goodness with fragrance of truffle oil, topped with bread crumbs. Share this, you won't be able to finish it. Oh and don't forget a beer. It's a heavy dish.-Veggie boneless wings are really good to snack on. It taste like the real thing. I swear. I get buffalo sauce and it's kind of salty but that's okay if I have an ice cold beer by my side.-Ahi sliders are very interesting and a must try. I felt like it was a bit salty, like everything else on their menu but the sliders were still tasty. When I took my first bite, I got a big burst of the juicy tomato and ahi tuna. It was so good, but when I got to my third one I was full. They come with a side of shoe string fries.Sorry for the long review, I've been here way too many times. Since I've been here so often, I concluded that their hospitality is outstanding but the waiter always goes on a long haitus. No matter what server you get. If you want your beer fast, just walk up to the bar and pay there. Otherwise, expect to wait 10 minutes for just your beer to come around. I usually come during happy hour and the wait to be seated is usually 20 minutes. Dinner time calls for a longer wait... 1-2 hours. Their happy hour is a total steal half off beers and select appetizers!", "Date": "2011-09-15", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Nicole D.", "ReviewID": "HPCxwDTqLwgL6lg2P5hddw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came in to grab some appetizers at the Yard House after strolling along Santana Row last weekend.

I've been a regular at the Pasadena Yard House since maybe 2004. I'm glad it finally opened in San Jose. My friend and I found ourselves in a huge crowd Saturday night. My friend, a marketing guru, told me that Santana Row enjoy the most foot traffic in the entire Silicon Valley. Little wonder this place was so packed on the opening weekend. Fortunately this place features a ginormous space and a huge bar, so we actually managed to find two stools to sit on. The staff was definitely on top of it all the time. Comparing to Rosie Mcanns, which we had just come from, the bartenders left themselves no slack to refill your thirst. There was no sign of Grand Opening Chaos. A well organized launch is tramendouly important, as most SV entrepreneurs are well aware.Yard Houses always have pretty interesting food. As anti-Asian fusion as I am, I actually don't mind at all a splash of Asian flavor in their dishes. I actually didn't eat at this new one, but I peeked over to some other people's food, and they look sensational.This of course doesn't solve Sanata Row's traffic and parking issues. Someone probably didn't forsee the incredible popularity of Santana Row, or overestimated South Bay's otherwise sterile nightlife, finding parking around here usually takes longer than driving to this place.

Poor waiter, he came by to ask me if I was satisfied with my Jambalaya and I decided to put my poker face on and tell him how everything was just horrible!

Your time is up.Yard House is centered in the perfect location facing Valley Fair and for all driving down Steven's Creek Blvd to see.** Just know that you'll wait at least 1-2 hours for a table, and because of the fire capacity, even if you have a table, if you leave, you might not be able to get back in (I had to wait in line 15 minutes to re-enter my own tables). Think of it like a nightclub, though no ratio required like Vegas :) **The service was mixed. My friends were told their table would be there in about 1.5 hours, but it took one party an hour, the other party 2 hours, and another 2.5 hours. The waiters and staff are very friendly and 5 stars to them, but one table it took one whole hour to get our beers and shots, another took 10 minutes. That's semi-ridiculous. The food did come fast, fresh, and tasty!Truffle fries - $3.95 for buttery, truffle infused string fries that are really good if you like the greasy, sweet type of fries. Expect to visit your cardiologist after though.Beers $4-7- over 150 on tap with yardlongs and the sort.Mojitos $9 - barely any alcohol, don't order cocktails here, they are really watered down and made quickly because of the huuuuuge lines at the bar, get shots / beers instead.Mac n Cheese House Special $17 - delicious! Truffle mushrooms, wild bacon, white meat chicken, a blend of cheeses. Oh my it was good in small quantity, I shared it with a friend and it was really good, though not quite worth $17.Thai Spicy Chicken Pizza $12 - my new goto dish here! I'll be back for it. 11 inches long (so good for 2 people with 8 slices) flatbread pizza that has really good thai chicken and spices on top. Put some tabasco on it and you're good to go.Definitely check it out, though go early, save a table and walk around Santana Row / Valley Fair while you wait.I wouldn't come here in the evenings like a lounge though as the non beer / shot drinks aren't that good and the line is long and you can't dance and the music isn't great either.

I've been hearing many comparisons of BJ's to this place but BJ's doesn't even come close in the quality of food nor the copious beer selections (130 on tap!) here. I'm not a huge beer fan but if you fruitier flavors, try the strawberry or blueberry ones. The venue is also huge and the ambiance is quite nice and fit for everyone.Came here for lunch on a Friday and the wait wasn't too bad considering it had just opened and we had a group of 8. However when we got there, we learned that although you cannot make reservations, you can call in advance to be put on a wait list for groups of 6+, something we will keep in mind for next time.The food is solid quality but a bit on the pricier. My friend and I split a lobster crab artichoke dip appetizer which I HIGHLY recommend. I've never had seafood in my artichoke dip before. it came with some tortilla chips and lots of pita triangles as well. Everyone's appetizers came out in a timely manner but the reason I won't give this place 5 stars is because of the loooooong wait for food. Had \u00a0we known the wait for food was so lengthy, we probably would have not even sat down. Most of the people ordered burgers, sandwiches, or salads and while they were all very good, it took about 45 minutes before all of the food came AFTER the appetizers arrived. Another qualm I have with the service is that they would not cut our burger in half even though my friend and I wanted to share. Their reasoning for that? \"Our chefs want to focus on the presentation of the entrees so they don't want to mess it up by cutting it in half.\" Well I mean it's a freaking burger, how presentable should it be?! We got the avocado swiss burger and it was basically slices of avocado, melted swiss cheese on top of the patty, with all the veggie fixings on the side of it (refer to my picture). Um, okay? Some 'presentation' that was... \u00a0Don't get me wrong, the food was tasty but the wait for food was a bit ridiculous and how they refused to cut it in half. I can forgive the fact that they're newly opened but had it been an established restaurant of a couple of months, that wouldn't sit well with me and I'd be more inclined to give them 3 stars instead.

Did I just wait 30 minutes to be disappointed.

Again, globlet size available only. To my surprise, it wasn't bad at all and it was very good. Tart, sweet, and like raspberry cider.-Truffle fries: DELICIOUS and probably the best appetizer on the menu! Think thinly sliced fries with truffle oil, tasted like garlic fries topped with \u00a0parmesan cheese. I think I can eat a whole bowl to myself. Portion size is quite small, but what can you expect for $3.95?-Calimari: breaded to perfection and came with marinara and tartar sauce.

Skip! - Chicken Garlic Noodles: chicken, asparagus, spinach, shiitake mushrooms, tiny pieces of \u00a0tofu, parmesan and edamame.

Going to any place known for beer, I tend to order beer-battered anything, so I went for the beer-battered fish and chips. The fish was perfectly fried and you could actually taste the beer batter. The french fries were okay, a bit disappointing, but I ate them anyway. The boy ordered the chicken strips with fries and he loved the sauces that came with the strips, his favorite was the honey-mustard.Our friends split a salad and a burger and they seemed to enjoy both. The boy's roommate ordered the blue crab sandwich and he loved it, he said the crab was very fresh.Service was great! Our server was very attentive and knowledgable about the different beers that they had on tap and always kept our drinks filled and asked if we wanted another round.I don't know about the other dining options in Santana Row but Yardhouse is a great choice.

Birthday dinner on the row.We arrived at 6:30 p.m., and even for a weeknight, the wait was out the door (although there isn't much waiting room inside anyway). \u00a0We were seated within 30 min., which was pretty decent taking into account the massive hype. \u00a0Also, waiting in Santana Row isn't that bad with so many shops and hangouts to kill time with. \u00a0Initial Vibe--------------Me and seven other dinner guests were seated on the mezzanine level of the restaurant which, while still considerable noisy, was less noisy than the lower level where the bar is. \u00a0We met our waiter, who was amiable enough.Starters and Something Yummy-------------------------------------------To start, we ordered the chicken nachos and the firecracker wings. \u00a0While the portion of the nachos was pretty huge, the flavor and uniqueness was pretty lackluster, something almost reminiscent of drunken late-night home-made nachos. \u00a0The firecracker wings, on the other hand, were amazing. \u00a0The order came with 8 crunchy and tasty wings on a bed of red cabbage, which I really could have done without.Main Course and Big Confusion--------------------------------------------We moved on to entrees. \u00a0Here's where things started to get dicey. \u00a0We were greeted by a new waitress who would be taking over while our waiter was on break. \u00a0Also, friendly enough. \u00a0I ordered the bearnaise burger and subbed the fries for sweet potato fries for a little extra. \u00a0Overall, the portion was good and the burger was cooked to pretty nice medium rare. \u00a0However, although I received my food, I couldn't say the same for some others at the table. \u00a0Amid some confusion from our table, our waiters, and the kitchen staff, four of our dishes had been lost, only one of which finally made its way to the table.So count it -- 3 dishes missing. \u00a0We alerted a waitstaff, who let us know she would alarm our waiter/ermm waitress, or whoever it was that was waiting our table. \u00a0When we didn't get a response for about 10 minutes, we tracked down another waitstaff. \u00a0Our original waiter came to our table to let us know that he had heard that all of our food actually did arrive and that we are all taken care of and dandy. \u00a0Not the case. \u00a0Another seven-ish minutes pass by and we're told that our food, although made, was left in the kitchen because of a lost order ticket. \u00a0Out comes the manager to ask if we'd like those dishes remade. \u00a0But it's now 8:30, an hour and a half since we first sat down. \u00a0No, we don't want those dishes anymore. \u00a0Dessert and a tart aftertaste-------------------------------------However, we are comp'ed with free desserts for each guest at the table, minus the birthday girl, who's already accounted for. \u00a0I share the sampler with a buddy (not that exciting) but really like the fresh-baked brownie with a scoop of ice cream. \u00a0Imagine a brownie pizookie, if you're familiar with BJ's: same tin-dish, same layout. \u00a0Our waiters are pretty intrusive now after the case of the missing dishes, checking in about every 5 minutes. \u00a0We try giving the hint that we'd like some privacy, but alas, our attempts continuously fail. \u00a0I dislike an absent waiter, but an intrusive waiter upsets me even more, repeatedly killing the vibe, conversation, and merriment of the table.In the end, we spent a good 3 hours at Yard House and save for a few gems in the menu, the overall experience left me with a bitter aftertaste. \u00a0The food was a solid 3 with a few hit and misses, but the service left a lot to be desired. \u00a0I'm not completely calling quits on this place, but I hope that if I do come back, I'll have a fruitier finish.", "Date": "2011-08-02", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "carissa w.", "ReviewID": "lwecETvEZL07vZ-4MPRhlQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I always always always get good service here....well until a couple weeks ago.

The steak came with mashed potatoes that looked like it was slightly baked (it had a browning/slight crisp to it like it was put in the oven). with a side of green beans. Overall a good dish.

During the 45 MINUTE WAIT I was looking at the novel of a menu they had. There are soooooo many options! But the menu seemed like BJ's but with an Asian fusion feel. Prices range around $8 to $40 depending on what you're feeling like. There's something for everyone. There's even a vegetarian section. It took me forever to pick something from the menu. Did I want beef? Pasta? Seafood? I was dizzy from reading everything. O_o And even once I was done with that, there's also the EXTENSIVE beer list. I went for the porcini crusted halibut and washed it down with their strawberry beer. =) The halibut had a DELICIOUS porcini and white truffle oil cream sauce with it. I dipped everything on the plate with it: mashed potatoes, fish and bok choy. And I'm not usually a fan of beer but this strawberry beer tasted more like a cider than anything else. You could really taste the strawberries!And what about dessert? Of course! I tried their Kona coffee sundae. Yum. The thin cookie that came with it was the best part. Don't know what you want? Bring a few friends and share! =) I tried part of my friend's steak sandwich. It was disappointing to say the least. It was dry and lacking flavor. So I guess the entrees are hit or miss.

My boy toy and I sat at the bar to avoid the 30 minute wait. Bar service was okay in the beginning, but still not as prompt as I preferred. As our dinner progressed, service slowly deteriorated. I ordered the chicken garlic noodles and my boyfriend got the surf and turf burger. Food came out, my chicken garlic noodles was good at first but then became too oily. I also did not like how they used ground chicken, it was weird eating chicken crumbles in a pasta dish. My boyfriend's plate was a piece of steak with shrimp; IT WAS NOT A BURGER. We were a bit baffled since he clearly ordered from the burger section of the menu. We politely informed our server Sarah (girl with a asymmetrical a-line, who desperately needed a trim) and she rudely said that, that is the surf and turf. We then said that we ordered a burger and she made up some bizarre excuse that the burger and the steak were both called \"surf and turf,\" even though our tab showed the steak as \"steak and shrimp!\" She totally gave us the impression that it was all our fault. It's like HELLO; we dont work here, we don't know the menu and if there were any confusion, it was her responsibility to clarify it with us. She then rudely took his plate away without an apology or even an explanation as to what she's going to do. My boyfriend then had to wait another 20+ minutes for his burger. I highly doubt that she even put in a rush order for it. The burger was also overly salty. After almost half way done with my garlic noodles, I noticed a piece of hair buried in the noodles. \u00a0I then informed another server (not Sarah since she was useless, rude, and incompetent) and that server politely asked if I wanted something else and told me that someone will be out shortly to speak with us.

He admitted she was wrong and that there is no such steak called \"surf and turf\".

Oops!So when I saw that Yard House was opening in Santana Row which is what I call my second home, I was seriously excited and couldn't wait. My friend an I were even looking up their menus a couple days in advance. I went last night on a quad-date. After reading the reviews on here, my boyfriend and I decided to arrive at 5:30pm put in my name and grab the buzzer for a party of 8 to hopefully get seated by 8. When we got to Yard House, the place was jammed packed. I spoke to Cat who took care of parties of 6 or more. She was extremely nice. The wait would be 4 hours. (not happy!) She told me since the parties who called in ahead didn't have their buzzers yet it left me ahead of them on the list so hopefully my party would be seated a bit earlier. She also mentioned to update her as more people of our party came.**Fast Forward**Our buzzer finally vibrated at 8:30pm. EXCITED! The place was nice, dark and loud. The tv was placed right on the wall at our table and of course the guys were happy because it was a hockey game on the screen. We were greeted by our waitress (forgot her name) and she took our orders. She was extremely nice and sweet despite the fact that one of our friends we met there was hitting on her. So the orders! Drinks:Snake Bite: It was good! It wasn't similar to the one I had while studying abroad in London but it still did satisfy my craving!Sampler: Two of the guys ordered the sampler and according to them it was not great. Food:Lobster, Crab and Artichoke Dip: ORGASM IN MY MOUTH! If you go this is a must order. The dip came with tortilla chips as well as pita bread. And yes, it did have lots of lobster and crab in it. They definitely did not skimp out on it.Chinese Garlic Noodles: It was good but after awhile the taste gets too overwhelming and makes you want to stop eating. I'm not a fan of mushrooms but if you are, it has plenty! Sweet Potato Fries: Yummy! Just the way I like it. Not soggy, thin and crisp. Bacon Burger: My boyfriend ordered this and he said it wasn't so great. \"Just like any other burger.\" It came with a side of fries which was a bonus because they were long, thin and crisp. Towards the end of eating, one of the guys had to go outside to take a call and after he wasn't allowed back in. Supposedly, the guy at the door yelled at him to get back in line thinking our friend was lying when he told the guy that he was already at a table. SERIOUSLY DUDE? The guy finished his dinner and all he needs to do is grab the bill, pay and leave. We told the girl at the door who was giving out buzzers that our friend already has a seat at the table. but she didn't believe us. Finally our waitress came and was able to bring him back in. And believe it or not, when he entered....he was given a wristband. THIS IS NOT A CLUB ALRIGHT?! Please get off your high horse and treat your customers better! By the time we left it was 11pm with a long line outside waiting to get in. All in all, I think this place is only packed because of the hype and it will eventually die down in a couple of months.

The negative thing that happened while we were eating was the fire alarm seriously went off for a good 15 minutes. The manager did come around to explain the situation, but it was whatever. I swear I heard the ringing of the alarm even after it stopped. The second time I came here, I took my parents for Mother's Day. We probably waited for at least 35 minutes.

On February 15th, I finally went to YH for my 21st birthday and it was lovely experience.Perhaps I'm easy to please, or the exceptionally price and delicious food they offer during on their Happy Hours, or the charming and witty staff that YH is known for. Oh heck, I'll say all of the above are what makes Yard House so special. My boyfriend and I went right at the beginning of their happy hour, so there was no waiting at all. However, as we sat throughout the two hours there, I noticed increasingly more and more people came for their HH and dinner. This made me extra glad that I got there early. So to start off, my bf got this beer that he will never forget (and he hates beer) and I got my first legal drink, Pomegranate Press Martini, it was sweet, fruity, and sweet at the same time. Next, I ordered Ahi Poke, Shitake Garlic Noodles, Gardein Wings, Fried Calamari, and Truffle Fries. Each dish were fantastic and the portion size is like an entree. I enjoyed every bit of the food with a big smile on my face. \u00a0Finally, as we were finishing up our entrees, our server brought us the dessert menu. And for me the bday girl, I got to choose one of their mini cakes with vanilla ice cream for free! My bf got the same but it was STILL decently priced! Out came the dessert and we heartily ate with open smiles while still finishing the last of our drinks. As sunlight dims into night time, the aura in the restaurant turns into a dark, cool, and sophisticated vibe. With everyone around us all having a good time like us, I couldn't help but eat a little bit more happy.Our total bill came out to be less than $45. For FIVE entree sized appetizers, two drinks and a dessert. My bf was surprised to find it so cheap, I couldn't agree more. Besides, our server was great and prompt with greeting us all the way to presenting our check. You would think it's unbelievable to get this type of deal in a place like Santana Row.

It's perfectly crispy and the portion is just perfect. The only con would be the price. $16.85 for chicken and rice is a bit pricey for me*shitake garlic noodle was ok. Not enough mushrooms I think. It did get a bit dry after a few minutes. Nothing special*truffle fries are a must!! It's a great snack while waiting for your entree or just munching while you're having a drink. I get it every time*gardein spicy Thai chicken pizza is ok. I didn't like the long strips of chicken. I wish they had chopped it so it would be easier to eat. Surprisingly, the pizza was just bland. I think they left it in the oven too long cause the sauce was too dried up. *gardein sliders and fries are absolutely delicious!! The portion is perfect. They give you 3 sliders with diff meat options and a side of fries*chicken nachos = must have!!! I ordered this with two coworkers and the 3 of us could hardly finish it. It has everything you can imagine on it. It's an absolute must try. I couldn't finish my entree after finishing this appetizer. So beware! Sharing is caring!*grilled cheese with tomato bisque was a little disappointing. The grilled cheese was a bit burnt and too salty for me. The tomato bisque is delicious though! Although I don't think I could finish a cup of it. A bit creamy but still great. Their beers and wine is pretty good. They have an entire menu for both.

I know it is not easy to be nice to everyone that you serve especially at a busy hour, however, as a paying customer, I expect decent service.  As we left the restaurant and were walking away, I heard someone yell something about skipping the bill from behind. I did not know it was intended for us. Our server ran past us and stood in front of us. He said \"did you decided to skip on the bill tonight?\" in a very rude manner. He had the check folder open and pushed it towards my friend's face. By this time, other people were staring at us. At that moment, I thought 'my God, someone took our money and now we are accused of not paying'. I took the bill from the server's hand and checked. Money was there under the printed check. Server said \"oh\", took the check back and left us. If he said sorry, I did not hear it and neither did my friends. I thought I would let him know how I felt. I managed to say \"dude\" as he walked away from us and never looked back.He was quick to accuse us rudely and loudly for others to hear. When proven wrong, he was just as quick to walk away without a proper apology. I was embarrassed by the false accusation and people staring at us and I was also embarrassed for having my friends go through such unpleasant experience at the restaurant.All my life, I've never been to a restaurant that treated customers like criminals.

Why? Well...I've come back here several times since my initial review and the service has seriously taken a huge hit. While still friendly and affable, it's gone slower than a snail's pace. Accuracy has gone out the door.Arrived here for a friend's post bday lunch celebration...ok, it was closer to 7pm. We were seated pretty quickly - under 30 minutes. SCORE!Our server greeted us with a friendly smile with the servitude to match. Can't get that much in the Bay Area nowadays so we were thrilled. However, things went downhill massively fast after that. We ordere appetizers that took 20 minutes to get to us, but when it did they were all stone cold; barely above lukewarm. We had to return 2 of them and when we received our allegedly newer appetizers, they were also stone cold/barely above lukewarm. We decided not to quibble.Main courses arrived! Yay! I got the mac and cheese, hubby got the pot pie and sadly, I forgot what our other friends got. Hubby's food was steaming hot - it looked fabulous and tasted great. Although it looked like the puff pastry wasn't browned long enough because it was a very pale shade and the layers under were just barely cooked....and then we got to my food. Stone cold. Like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. The cheese sauce had coagulated and started to thicken in a way that was not appealing. The freshly sprinkled cheese on top looked like it had seen 15 minutes already and was about to expire.We'd have definitely complained, but our server was nowhere to be found. I take that back, she was flying around so much that we couldn't flag her down. Plus, I think she was miffed about us having complained earlier. It's not her fault, is it?They have runners, but it seemed very slow and a bit disorganized which was a very marked difference from the other YH I've frequented and from when it first opened. I think this location needs to be retrained because they clearly can't keep up with the demand of a busy, fast paced restaurant.When the YH gets it right, it's great - it's what keeps me coming back, but I don't want it to turn into another BJ's for me.

I wish there were more Belgians, and the domestic selection had more craft beers, but it's still an amazing selection. Your Bud Light drinking redneck friends will find something, as well as your friend who can't stop talking about the barley concentration from when he made his own beer.3) Fun environment.

I love how they categorize their beers so that it is much easier to find a new beer to try while knowing its taste is similar to one you like. Being a fan of citrusy and orange spiced beers, I decided to order the Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat. I thought Blue Moon was my favorite beer but have now discovered Leinenkugel's is even better!! Between the food and conversations, I also ordered the House Honey Blonde and Lost Coast Apricot Wheat. These two were also delicious as they have subtle tastes of honey/apricot. After all that beer, we decided to order some food. I was more then excited to try the spicy tuna roll as its presentation looked beautiful. It was basically layers of seared rare ahi, edamame, cucumbers, and a generous layer of avocado. A soy sauce based sauce and squirts of siracha surrounded the circular layer of deliciousness. It looked beautiful with all the colors and layers.. And for only $6, it's definitely a steal :)I also tried some of the boneless buffalo wings but have to say it's mediocre. It would have tasted a lot better if the outer layer was more crispy. Instead, the buffalo wings were soft and squishy. The buffalo sauce was good but the texture of the wings were not that great. For the price and large beer selection, I would definitely come back for happy hour! We left around 6pm and by then the place was already packed. Many people just stood around with their drinks as there were no more spots open at the bar/tables. Be warned, it's hard leaving this place without wanting to try numerous beers on tap.

From the reviews, it seemed like this was a pretty popular place and actually hard to get in, but we were lucky and it was a bad weather weekend where no one wanted to go out to the bars. Since it was past 10 pm, they had us get wristbands to get drinks at the bar, which was no big deal, and we got in just like that even though we had a pretty big group (6 people).It was semi-crowded inside (maybe about 80% full), but lots of people were already on their way out. This place has a crazy awesome selection of beer. TONS of beer on tap. From domestic to imports, this place has something for every beer lover (and even some cocktails for the non-beer drinker). As I said in another review, I'm not a huge beer person, but I can appreciate the finer beers (aka not the Natty Light/Budweiser types).My friend picked up a Firestones Ale, while I tried one of their specialty lambics, the Tellermans Framboise (they had strawberry ones too which his cousin's sister got). My friend's cousin got a pear cider, while her fiancee picked a Leffe Blonde. We all seemed to like our drinks (and there are definitely non-beer drinkers in our group). After wandering for a while (tons of people had the half yard, which is basically this huge glass that is half a yard long), we decided we would sit down at a table and chill for a bit.It wasn't too difficult to get a table at all. After sitting down, we decided to order some food and ended up deciding on some chicken tenders, their truffle fries, and some calamari. The food came relatively quickly and it all looked pretty reasonable. There were maybe four chicken tenders, which we all shared, which came on top of a generous serving of thin cut pencil fries (which were really done well). The truffle fries were tasty and fried perfectly and covered with Parmesan shavings and herbs (some of the best I've had). The calamari was well... calamari. Nothing special, but nothing awful either.Had a great time here; the only thing that we had a gripe about was the fact the waitress kept coming to our table and asking us if we wanted to order more drinks/food (like every 10 minutes). I think for a table our size, our table wasn't netting her a bunch.

Cooked with bacon, chicken, and truffles. Very tasty and I am sure horribly unhealthy, but its just so yummy.

We were told the wait would be 3 hours so we just got a round of beer at the bar n went to cheesecake factory. The best way to get a bartender's attention is to wait by the cash register. The female bartender totally ignored us, probably bc she was mackin' on her two male customers. I went over to the next cash register and the male bartender recognized us immediately. My friends aren't into beer, so naturally we ordered the girly ones: leinkugel sunset wheat, timberland strawberry, and aproicot hef wheat.

We arrived a t6:25pm and were told the wait would be 45-hour, but it was actually 20 mins wait. I guess better to over estimate rather than under estimate. My server was rather annoying because she kept on checking up on us while she was busing other table. I'm almost positive she did that on purpose to get a quick turn around. I had the surf and turf burger which was excellent. Lobster and artichokes! YUM. My brother Thai Chicken Noodle. Bland as fuck. Avoid that dish. Avoid the lettuce wraps too.

Seeing as how I come to Yard House quite often, I never really thought of doing a Yelp review on them and, on a random trip for lunch to the San Jose one, I decided to just do one.Right off the bat, I'm gonna give it five stars just for the beer selection that Yard House offers. EVERY Yard House you visit has AT LEAST 120 beers on tap so if you say you can't find a beer to drink, I'm gonna be a little inclined to call you a liar haha EVERY beer I have tried I have not disliked and always found very interesting as the beers I end up trying are very different and unique and not like your typical Bud Light flavor profile. The BIGGEST thing, literally, that makes Yard House what it is, is they're option they give to people to serve ALL 120+ beers in half-yard glasses....yes...that's right....HALF-YARD glasess as you can probably see from the pictures that other Yelpers have posted. Quit thinking about it and just get one, you won't be sorry.....or....maybe you will be...depending on how you look at it =P hahaOn to the food...for being a place that has 120+ beers on tap, the food choices are very gourmet and give off the \"high class\" vibe that you would get from other high end places, but still keeping the comfortable ambiance that you're looking for. My co worker and I came for lunch, as I mentioned before, and I wasn't in the mood for a main entree, so I settled for a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger with truffle fries (See Picture). The burger was delicious! Moist, tender, and never lost its flavor. The BBQ sauce was served on the side and had a very unique flavor profile because, of course, it's made out of rum. The truffle fries were delicious as well...crispy, great notes from the truffle and not too overpowering...proved to be a great balance with the burger.As I said before, I've been to Yard House for dinner quite a few times (Understatement of the Year haha) so I've also had a few dinner dishes, which I feel need to be honorably mentioned:(Mac + Cheese)2 - Really tasty and can't really go wrong with Mac & Cheese...it's like your typical Mac & Cheese on steroids.Southern Fried Chicken Breast - My absolute FAVORITE dish at Yard House! Very well balanced, very tasty, and the textures of the mashed potatoes, the crispy chicken breast, and the bourbon gravy are a perfect match.Surf & Turf Burger - I didn't have this myself; however, one of my good friends had it and had swore up and down about being very tasty and flavorful. The lobster and beef made for a perfect combination.I can't say enough good things about Yard House, the people that have given Yard House bad reviews are probably based on bad service or a bad experience, but the times that I have been there, which have been quite a few, I have no complaints!

It wasn't as flavorful as I would like it (I guess that's what the light sodium soy sauce they give you is for), not enough ponzu sauce and I don't really like the sliced avocado on the side, I liked it more when it's mixed together with the fish. I also don't dig the overflown beansprout and carrot shreds with sesame oil (personal preference, some people may really like it). I LOVED the ahi steak sandwich though, so good! The ahi steak was cooked perfectly with the center being raw still, the caramelized onion adds the perfect sweetness to the sandwich, bread was perfectly toasted (very greasy though) and the tomato/spinach(arugula?) balanced out the heavy-ness of the sandwich. I opted out the fries for steamed vegetable, which is just your typical snap peas, broccoli, and carrots- nothing too special.

Seemingly huge range of beers on the menu.Can i say how i drooled over the menu (available online)... it all sounds YUM but the truth of the matter is that most places that serves that variety of beer usually considersfood a lower priority. it's like beer goggles - the more you drink the less you noticethe food isn't really up to par - you'd order anything fried to soak up the alcohol anyway!However, with no alcohol at the table, my perspective on the food here was unclouded...passion fruit ice tea (not bitter at all, quite refreshing as ice teas go)shrimp cerviche spoons - delish. There's 4 little spoons and I would have easily been able to eat 2 plates of these by myself.The shrimp was fresh, the flavors balanced just right between the lime and mango for sweet and tart flavors. With a fewstripes of crunchy tortilla chips on top, this was a perfectly balance bite for those who likes fresh seafood.appertizer ceasar salad - pretty standard ceasar salad, however the extra cheese cracker bites added a bit of interesting textureand flavor.Ahi Tuna appertizer - delicious citrus-gingerish sauce. This was yummy and my friend and i fought over the last bites.Jambalaya - yummy yummy. This was by far one of the best interpretation of jambalaya i've had. Granted this dish is got somepretty strong red pepper flavors and gets a bit greasy in the end, but lots of seafood, lots of flavor. I'd definitely order againYard house has some mini size desserts and full size ones - I think it's a great idea. Especially when shared, even when my friendand I were so full, we still ordered a mini dessert each to finish the meal without overeating (well, without SEVERELY overeating).the mini lemon souffle - yummy, airy and definitely lemony. it's like a fluffy light version of cake and i inhaled it along with the 3 raspberries on top.mini creme brulee - this one is interesting - you'd definitely have to love bananas. They put sliced bananas on top and torch itso the top of the banana is caramelized, then you get the creme part, but on the bottom, it's got melted chocolate chips.However, the chocolate chips were no longer 'melted' at serving time. I think they could do even better by quickly torching the bottomto remelt the chocolate chips, then torch the top for the sugar glaze, then serve it. All in all Yard House offers a decent variety for the picky eaters (non seafood, non meat, etc etc) - lots of decent beer choices (I'llhave to come back to try and follow up with an updated review). They have half size lunch portions as well as mini portion desserts, whichhands down wins my heart (I am one of those ppl who loves to try the flavors of a lot of different food but isn't so happy having 1 single huge heaping plate of food). I would order everything again - and definitely crave the Ahi Tuna appertizer as well as the jambalaya. For the amount and qualityand variety of food I shared for lunch, the price is decent (also considering this is in Santana Row). All in all I would definitely recommentthis place if you want decent food in a casual but clean environment. (I hope it stays this way even after the restaurant is no longer so 'new')I hear there's lines on weekends so your best bet is to come on weekdays if you really want to try the food.

Now I've been to the Yard Houses down south, and you can just walk in and grab a seat. It is quite the opposite here. At Santana Row, you're looking at a 2 hour wait no matter the day or time you're coming here. There will be a horde of people waiting outside/inside just clamoring for a place to sit. What saves you from all of this is just walking to the bar to grab one of their huge assortments of beer. Now with a place named Yard House, you're sure not coming here for the food. You're here for those ridiculous amount of beers that they have on tap. From your mainstream beers to the micro-brews, Yard House has enough beers to get you drunk for a month. The bar area is pretty decently sided, but don't let that fool you. You're still going to have a rough time getting a spot to stand/sit and most likely, your group is just going to hover to the nearest patch of empty space in the area. Nonetheless, the prices are pretty reasonable. If you're a true bad ass, you can opt for the yard glasses and go to town. Obviously this place is popular as hell since there's no other big hangout spot in the area. The closest I can think of would be downtown San Jose. Thus, for all the drunkards, this will end up sucking your funds away. I'm sure by now, all the other businesses are feeling their alcohol money being sucked away and towards Yard House.One thing that does also suck is that since this place opened, it's becoming increasingly impossible to find parking, even in the 6 story lot.

You can walk around Santana Row to kill time before you get a seat or head to the bar in the middle of restaurant.In terms of food, Yardhouse takes the \"shotgun\" approach and offers a wide variety of American fusion items.

It came with two giant blackened shrimp, spicy chicken-andouille sausage, crawfish, pan blackened red and pasilla peppers, and a cajun tomato cream sauce. It could be served over linguine pasta, jasmine, or brown rice. The jambalaya had a nice spicy kick to it that wasn't overpowering.

The service was awesome, our server came back to check on us to make sure everything was great without being too overbearing.

The way they designed the bar is incredible! All the beers on tap are in the middle and once you lay your eyes on it, don't be surprised if you see a bright light shine down and hear angels singing...it's that good. We didn't wait too long for our table for lunch, and sat near the bar area. Our waitress was very friendly and normal, and let us take our time to order. She also let the cooks take their time to make our food...because it took ages! I know in America we get our panties in a twist when food doesn't come out right away.. But I am not one of those people. I am happy to chat and wait for my food to be made... but even I was feeling like it was taking way too long. I didn't time it or anything, so I can't give you numbers, but just don't go here when you are starvin' marvin.. or you will get cranky waiting. I ordered the 1/2 sandwich and soup, with a side of sweet potato fries. The sandwich was 'meh'. I would have preferred the crab cake on it's own considering the bread was twice the size of the crab cake in between it. Who wants all that extra bread? I also had the French Onion soup which was delicious, but the fries were not that impressive. I am picky so some people might like really crispy sweet potato fries, but they just didn't have great flavor. I would go back for an evening happy hour after 10 and for dinner.

Unfortunately, the boyfriend and I tried to have an upscale beer lunch. If this is your goal, don't go to The Yard House.So lets start with the pluses. Everything we had that was drenched in butter or deep fried was delicious. Second, I love that they have little beer sample trays which as someone who is forever learning about beer is really fun for me. Third, beer floats! I've never had one of these before and they are actually really delicious. I'm going to credit the yard house with my discovery of these, even though I'm pretty sure I can get them elsewhere or even make my own. Now with the negatives in handy bullet points!~Ahi Tuna Entree was severely overcooked and poorly prepared. They basically served me was a medium rare ahi steak, when I was expecting what you get everywhere else when you order pan-searched ahi, which is raw tuna with a slight butter singe on the edges so you can stick sesame seeds to it. I understand this may be a liability thing as The Yard House wants mass market appeal, but, yeah, just gross. Also, don't drench your mistakes in soy sauce!~Any place that is charging upwards of $25 for an entree needs to have professional wait staff, not just a bunch of college kids who would rather gossip by the POS terminals, then wait on their tables. \u00a0Our waiter didn't even ask us how everything was or offer us a desert menu?

The taste that is left in your mouth after the after-taste is definitely strawberry, but the after-taste has a coin/metal taste to it. How do I know? Just trust me. I've only been here twice and would like to try a new beer every time I go, but they have such a wide selection I'll probably have to choose one from each category/brand. Food: I shared an ordered of the Hawaiian Poke and New York Steak Salad. The poke tasted fresh & would get it again to share, but I've definitely had better. They served it with steamed bean sprouts and sliced carrots. A little weird pairing but being a fan of both veggies was good to me. The meat on the salad was cooked to perfection. I like medium rare but the meat was cooked to medium so it stayed juicy and was still flavorful. There were fresh potato chips in the salad??? I usually like crunch in my salad but the steak was heavy enough so having something fried in my salad was not very appetizing. Perhaps ask to have them on the side or to hold them. \u00a0Price: $$$.

They did not skimp on the avocado which made me so happy and it was sliced thin which made the process of eating the delicious burger easier.

I was wrong. \u00a0A plus is that the menu is extensive and caters to diverse tastes.SERVICE (pretty good)Generally, I have had satisfactory customer service at Yard House. \u00a0Hostesses seem to be remarkably efficient in handling waits. \u00a0In my experiences, servers were fast, even when the place was packed. \u00a0My experiences at the bar have not been as positive. \u00a0I have found the bar staff to be less attentive and less friendly than the staff as a whole. \u00a0I once had a memorably negative experience when I was intentionally ignored by a bartender.ATMOSPHERE: (good)The layout and atmoshpere make Yard House a fun place to be. \u00a0Over-sized tables and chairs are comfortable. \u00a0I do wish the televisions were bigger; they aren't proportionate to the enormous room. \u00a0I often have difficulty reading text on the televisions.MISCELLANEOUS NEGATIVES:Often there are long waits to eat at Yard House; waits can exceed an hour. \u00a0Even seats in the bar area can be hard to come by.I have experienced lines for the restroom that rival those you would find at a sporting event -- no joke. \u00a0The men's restroom has 2 or 3 toilets and 2 urinals. \u00a0I think this is insufficient for a beer/wine/liquor establishment with a capacity of over 500. \u00a0To me, one of the benefits of suburban chain restaurants should be their ample restroom facilities.Yard House serves 24-ounce beers in 3-foot tall bongs they call \"half-yards.\" \u00a0The use of these half-yards as drinking vessels is a gratuitous spectacle that I don't appreciate. \u00a0The half-yard is difficult to drink (one practically has to take it off the table and put it in his lap to sip).Apparently, management has adopted a practice of showing every available sporting event and not changing channels even when there is substantial interest in a particular event. \u00a0I discovered this recently when I was at Yard House when a Raiders game was being aired. \u00a0My group and a whole lot of other Raiders fans were in a section where the televisions were showing Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Buffalo Bills (or some equally inconsequential game). \u00a0According to the waitress, patrons are encouraged to tell the hostess that they are interested in a particular event, and the hostess will seat them in areas where that game is being shown... if not, \u00a0you run the risk of sitting in the \u00a0section where the loser bowl is being played. \u00a0Why does Yard House even play uncompelling games with non-local and low-market teams?

The menu is insanely huge so you'll have to come back here multiple times to try out everything. My favorite dishes were the jambalaya and the truffle fries. OMG! The truffle fries are so good! I could taste the hint of truffle oil, and they were super thin and crispy. Just how I like it. The jambalaya is the best I've ever tried at a restaurant! There were a lot of pieces of crawfish and shrimp. I was so happy they didn't skimp on that. I hated the ahi tuna stack. It was just disgusting. The sauce it was drenched it was bitter and bad. The crab cake was also bland and needed salt. Since this place is a chain, I have to really go by what I know. I've tried the Irvine one and the Los Angeles one. This one by far is the smallest restaurant of the three. No wonder there is such a long wait. I don't know why they couldn't have thought of making it bigger when they were building it.

Most of it, I wouldn't call fine dining or rave-worthy, though its a gallant attempt at sophisticated cuisine for a place that is thematically just a United Nations of Hops and Barley. Personally, so long as there's a Mac&Cheese (made with chicken, smoked bacon, truffle oil!) in front of me, I'm bueno. Keep the beers coming...And there's that.Regrettably, the beer selection here isn't as various or numerous as at other Yard Houses. (The online menu vaguely says \"130-250 taps\"; the Santana Row site is at the lower end.) Thankfully there are a few favorites and go-to brews on hand here (and at most of the YardHouses I've been to), but there are some better bars for exploring/appreciating beer/s.But the most unfortunate aspect of this particular Yard House is how inundated (afflicted?) it is with [a certain ilk of] people because of its location. Business-wise, I'm sure they're making money hand over fist. That's good and I'm glad that they're successful because - in full disclosure - I know people that work there and it'd be awesome if they're benefiting from the high traffic, but gone (and maybe never-was?) is any semblance of the fun and chill YardHouse experiences I got in Chicago, or San Diego, or even the Vegas locations.

Unfortunately there are just too many things to try and I don't live quite close enough to make a weekly trip there, so I spread my wings to other areas of the menu.

Why do people wait 2 hours for this place? And why was I one of those people? SMH. I've heard everyone rave about this place and when Yard House finally made its Northern California debut, I was definitely intrigued. Then I heard about the outrageous wait times at this place and I was quickly turned off.But one fateful Saturday night brought me here for dinner. I was having dinner with some of my San Jose friends and I suggested that we go here for dinner, since this place is so hyped up; I consider myself a hype-monger, who seeks to try only the newest and the hottest \"ish.\" I stopped by Yard House at 6pm to put my name down on the wait list. I was quoted a wait time of 2 hours. Goodness gracious. Normally I would have said \"eff this\" and gone some where else to eat. But I was sort of set on YH, so I put my name down and just went shopping at Valley Fair Mall for 2 hours. Fast forward to 8pm and my table is finally ready. This place reminds of BJ's. They have a similar decor and seating arrangements. Let me preface my review, by saying yes they have a lot of beers on tap, but honestly their beer selection is pretty mediocre. You can pretty much find any of those beers at a Whole Foods or a BevMo. If you are a true brew snob, get ready to be disappointed.But if you are someone who considers themselves a non-beer snob, there are some good things about this place. One thing that YH does well is that it gets a lot of my non-beer drinking friends to actually drink beer. They forgo the fou-fou cocktail drinks and indulge in the elixir of the gods, beer. Plus beer served by the half-yard is a nice touch as well.The food here is not bad. The portion sizes are pretty huge; think Cheesecake Factory or Applebee's huge.For starters, my friends and I had the onion ring tower. The name pretty much describes the meal. Onion rings arranged in the shape of a tower.For my main entree, I ordered the crab crusted swordfish. This dish was alright. I felt that the swordfish was a little too overcooked for my liking, so the fish turned out dry and stringy. But ignoring the texture of the food, I thought the flavors were great. The fish was topped with a lemon grass white sauce, which was both citrus-y and creamy. I was huge fan of the wasabi mashed potatoes and thought this unique combination worked well together.I sampled my friends' entrees, which included the mac and cheese, fried chicken breast and the lobster garlic noodles. I was huge fan of the mac and cheese because it was littered with pieces of bacon and chicken. The fried chicken was especially crispy and worked well with the helping of mashed potatoes and gravy it was accompanied with. The lobster garlic noodles is a good dish if you love comma inducing and extra buttery carbs, oh yeah and seafood; the garlic noodles were topped with large chunks of lobster and shrimp.For dessert, I had the chocolate souffle. This was a pretty decent dessert. Thank you for the YH staff for paying me to courtesy of topping off my dessert with a birthday candle and spelling out \"Happy Birthday\" with cocoa powder. Thanks again. Overall, this place is alright if you want to get a beer, but the wait time is pretty outrageous. Wait till the hype dies down and then this place will be a lot better.

The booths in the far wall sat 10 of us comfortably (we were all fairly petite), so next time if I come with that many, I'd ask for 1 booth so the wait would be shorter.From my friends I tried their Truffle Fries which were really good, Ahi Tuna sliders which were bomb, and the Blueberry beer had a light fruitiness to it.Personally, I shared an Avocado Swiss Burger w/ Sweet Potato Fries and the Turkey Pot Pie with a friend and washed it all down with the Strawberry Beer/Cider thing (sorry forgot the name). The burger was a perfect medium rare (just the way I like it), but the fries were mediocre. The turkey in the potpie was moist and the crust was bomb. The strawberry beer was really good.

What I like about the place is the many beer's they have on tap and the verity of taste. My favorite beer is the: Youngs double chocolate stouts with Wyder raspberry cider! It a mix that was made when I first went to this location. A waiter had brought it up to me and said no one has tried it before and I thought I'd give it a try and that turn out really good. This drink has stuck with me ever since. OH AND BTW they did add this mix onto the menu but they put a framboise in the mix instead of the Wyder that does make a price difference since the framboise is more they don't do it in the half yard. So if you want the drink in a half yard I suggest getting what I get. \u00a0It is pretty bomb because its strong and then gets light and fruity!Food wise: I like the truffle fries and the mac and cheese but mac and cheese can be a bit greasy once it cools off.

The portion sizes for the half off appetizers were very generous. The draft pints were about $4.25 each. The service, however, left something to be desired. Considering the fact that we arrived at 3:15 when the restaurant was half empty, it took WAY too long for our drinks to arrive. We were presented with menus immediately, but it took 10 minutes for a server to come around to check IDs and take orders. Also, the beers took at least another 10 minutes while my fried food appetizers took another 10 minutes! I can understand the delay when there are people waiting 30 minutes for a table, but now when the restaurant is experiencing a slump in business. Service was rather unobtrusive, and by that, I mean that we were never really visited to be asked about service. None of this really bothered me because we weren't in much of a hurry, taking about 2 hours to finish off 2 pints each, but I would be annoyed with this pace of service if I had waited more than 30 minutes to be seated.I will return for happy hour, between 3 and 6pm on weekdays, but probably not during peak hours.

That was pretty awesome.Anywho, lets talk food and drink. I'm not much of a beer drinker but I ordered the \"Timmerman's Strawberry\", which tastes like a carbonated strawberry soda only except it made my cheeks turn a little pink (yes, I am lightweight when it comes to alcohol).

The toppings on the nachos were typical: beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, guacamole, sour cream. If you come with a group of 4, I would say to only get one order of that to share. I had also ordered the \"Truffle Fries\", since before I came here I checked on Yelp to see what I should try and what the hype was all about; these fries reminded me of the garlic fries you would get at the carnival. The potatoes were pretty much dried out and seasoned with garlic powder, salt and some green herb. Nothing really memorable.Last but not least (don't judge me, I was sharing all of these with my boyfriend), I had ordered the \"Classic Mini Sliders\", which consists of 4 mini sliders & a small regular fries on the side. These mini sliders were decent, they kind of reminded me of the sliders you would get at Burger King. Overall, I spent $46 (tips not included) and gave this place a 3 star.

There where 3 ladies at the front, one of them was helping some customers and the other two just looked down at their computer of whatever is under the glass top table. Is it so hard to ask for a \"Be right with you\" or \"She'll help you in a sec\"? At least look up and smile when people walk in. What is wrong with customer service?Once we got someone to walk us to our table, they were super nice! Our server was great and gave us tons of suggestions. We sat at the pub style tables. The place is nice, much bigger than I expected. Steely decor with black accents and colorful paintings. I was surprised how many people drink during lunch. Hee. Anyways, the food was average, nothing to write home about. We got the truffle fries to share and I ordered the blue crab cake hoagie with a side salad. My friend ordered the full hoagie. The weird thing was when he asked if it came with a salad, he was told that it would be an additional charge. Why couldn't he just swap the fries for a salad? I don't think salad costs any more than fries does it? And why weren't we told that a sandwich comes with fries when we ordered the sandwich? We had an overload of fries. I think servers should be able to let people know. The truffle fries were indeed good with some slivers of what I think was Parmesan cheese. The hoagie was ok. The lunch portion only has one crab cake which wasn't that big or moist but had good flavor. It didn't have enough bacon, avocado, swiss, or tomato, and you could barely taste the cajun a\u00efoli.

The garlic noodles were surprisingly delicious and had tons of veggies, flavor and texture. The mac and cheese was very fancy and had tons of wild mushrooms and truffle oil- a very different take from what you expect mac and cheese to be. The drinks were delicious and very well prepared.

I'll write a bit about my initial thoughts and hopefully update my review later on.I dropped by on the first Saturday night they were officially open. It was about 10:30-11pm and still fairly crowded probably due to grand opening buzz. There was a bit of a line outside but I think it was more for ID checking rather than waiting. In fact we didn't even have to wait at all,a s once we got inside a hostess offered to take us to an open table. However, when she arrived at the \"open\" table there were people just being seated there. She looked confused and then said we can wait for the party in the next booth to leave, and they looked like they were about to pack up and go so we said ok. She told us we could sit at a table to wait and we did that. After maybe 5 minutes those people did leave, but no waiter came by to move us into the booth. We flagged one down and he said he didn't know if we could do that since it wasn't his section. He then asked another waitress who also shrugged her shoulders. It seemed like they both didn't know what to do so they decided to just ignore us. After a few more minutes we asked again and he said he could do it but if anybody asked to not say it was his idea. Great...Our server eventually showed up and I asked her for recommendation on some menu items. It seemed like either she couldn't hear me well or she didn't know what I was talking about until I pointed specifically to the menu. Her descriptions also weren't very helpful and she used really vague words. I asked about one of the beers they had and she just used the keywords that were printed on the menu for that type of beer. I understand that they have 130+ beers on tap so she probably hadn't had a chance to try everything yet, but I do remember at all my previous trips to Yard House the waiters were more than helpful recommending something new for me to try.

Arriving early paid off and I got second on the list for the large parties. The wait would have been roughly an hour and a half. So I took a pager and went on my merry way to walk around the mall and the rest of The Row. Once a little more than half of our group was inside, I checked to see if something had already cleared up. We got a spot near the entrance, which was fine so anyone who came later could locate us right away. As for the food, it wasn't bad. I probably shouldn't have had high expectations to begin with since this place is more known for their beers than anything else. Such a ginormous selection that if you don't know what to drink, you'll need someone to help you out, be it a friend or one of the servers. Had pints of both Shock Top and Hoegaarden since this location didn't serve Abita Purple Haze (boo). Had a swiss burger and substituted the regular fries for truffle fries. Never had truffled anything, so I was really excited for these babies. I did like them, however, I felt that it was a tad too greasy for my taste. If I'm ever back here again, I'll probably order them as an appetizer to get a second opinion. But I'll try another item instead of a burger.My thoughts on Yard House? Definitely the place to go to if you're a beer lover. And not a bad place to hang out with a few friends, as bigger groups provide a long wait.

Disclaimer: I've only been here for Happy Hour (day and night) and dinner on a Thursday night. I don't know how weekends or lunches go.Well, I'm glad the hype died down a little bit. When it first opened up, this place was rolling in crowds. It would take about an hour to get seated, but now I can walk in right when Happy Hour starts and get a table. They have a similar seating system to BJ's, but there's plenty of space and a huge bar right in the middle. The venue is low lit, almost like you're eating in a Hollister clothing store, but gradually lightens up the closer to closing.Happy Hour (M-F 3-6pm; Sun-W 10-C) consists of select appetizers and all pizzas for half off, and about $4 for their crafts and imports, $3.50 for domestics, well drinks under $5, and half yards for between $7 and $10--among other things. Let me just say, you can never go wrong with their appetizers. Their Chicken Nachos plate is ridiculously huge and can accommodate 2-4 people probably, but then again you have smaller plates like fried calamari. But everything is pretty much good on their chosen selections. Chicken Lettuce Wraps are huge, hella wings, and a good amount of onion rings on the tower. Their pizzas are medium sized but are built mainly for one person. It'll look like a lot, but that thing can fill up, trust!And if you want fries, Truffle Fries are your calling.Drink-wise, they have a mighty fine selection of beers on tap, neatly organized on their front few pages of the menu. Most people's favorite would probably be Sunset Wheat (White Ale). If you haven't heard of it, yikes. Their stronger beer is labeled. Try their Stone Arrogant Bastard Ale.Anyway, this is a good place to catch up with friends or go for an occasional night out to drink.BUT. I hate how they rush you out before midnight. I work at a restaurant and am never allowed to force people out of the building. First, they close their kitchen at 11pm, so if you're not at a table by then, you're not getting food. Bar closes probably around 11:30. Then the lights gradually turn on, servers expedite the bill to their tables, then if you're still there by 11:55, management comes walking around and telling you that you have to leave! I don't like the hospitality at the end of the night! Don't get me wrong, the servers are probably some of the best, very sociable, consistent and precise (Rex, Bernardo, Jessica, I see you).

Saturday: whole different story, the wait at 6pm was a 4 hour wait and thank god I was here friday to tell my friend to go early and get a table. He did just that and still waited 2 hours. finally seated I ordered the Southern Fried chicken ***** that gets a 5 star long with their Mac & Cheese OOOOOOH Yea will have to come back for both!!! I thought the atmosphere was great could have been a bigger establishment but oh well. Its not a club its a sports bar, so if you want to party not the place to go.

Now onto the food: Guacamole and chips - hard to screw up but definitely enjoyedGrilled Artichoke - oh how I love the artichoke, and the dipping sauce is so devine! French dip sandwich with a side Caesar salad - the sandwich was thinly sliced with no fat on it which equals melting in your mouth yumminess! As for the Caesar salad, it wasn't your typical Caesar dressing but it had a nice twist to it. Chicken Nachos - loved the two green and red tomatillo sauces, and the guacamole wasn't an extra charge! Two thumbs up! We got this both times!Thai chicken Pizza - didn't care for it, too sweet for my liking. Outer crust was goodBoneless buffalo wings - the chicken was really crispy but not very breaded, absolutely loved them and they had a bit of a kick to them as well. Four cheese pizza - the two bites I ha I enjoyed but it was gone before I could have a whole slice. Definitely liked the cheese one over the Thai chicken one!

For our appetizer, we eventually ordered the Lobster, Crab, and Artichoke Dip, which was really good! I loved the baked pita that came with it!

I had the spicy tuna roll, which has a thick layer of creamy avocado on top of another thick layer of chopped seared ahi tuna that's seasoned very well with soy sauce and sesame oil. This is definitely the portion for two. The shitaki garlic noodles were also delish! It was also seasonsed perfectly with the right amount of butter and parmesan cheese so it was not overly greasy. I LOVED the shitaki mushrooms in the noodles, which were cooked perfectly and you could taste the flavor of the shitaki in the noodles too. Again the portion was big enough for two.The Korean sweet BBQ beef, also an appetizer dish, was also huge, with lots of sweet, tender BBQ beef on top of a generous portion of steamed rice. With all of the above one wonders why the need to order the main dish???And we sure did not need to order any main course. MAF got the caesar salad with grilled chicken. Agian, this was a huge plate and after completing the above BBQ beef plate he could only finish half of his salad!The place is huge too and at at night you can see through the glass windows the views of part of Santana Row and the mall on Stevens Creek Blvd accross the street.

Service was a little slow getting us drinks and food, it is a very large restaurant and they are serving many at a time, but there were no bread sticks or chips or anything to tie you over while you are waiting.To make the night easier we did valet service $8.00 + tip, put our names in well before we were hungry and went shopping. The wait time was 1 1/2 wait to be seated and it was pretty true to it's time. This was a Saturday night. We also previewed the menu and knew what to order, so when we were seated we placed our orders right quick. I totally recommend the peppered filet mignon so good, and my husband had the steak and shrimp which was devoured. We had drinks that were just okay and the desserts and coffee were also just okay. Overall great night, great dinner and we walked out at just over $100 but we splurged.", "Date": "2013-11-02", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Richard B.", "ReviewID": "5pqPZQEAIwGt4M1mQ0wAEg", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just sent this to the YardHouse websiteHi, I was just in this location to take my brother here for the first time after we went to Santana Row for Christmas shopping. He was so excited to check It out. It looked like it just opened at 11 because there wasn't many people and the bartenders were still stocking the bar. We sat up at the bar and was approached by a bartender, given menus and was told she'd be right with us and went back to stocking. We sat there for about 10 minutes with no acknowledgment at all. I noticed another bartender working on the computer or something. He looked over at us a couple times without coming over go check on us. We got up and walked to the host stand because I wanted to speak to a manager to let them know my disappointment. They told me the bartenders were the managers, so I told the host that we were sitting there for a while and didn't get any help, waters or our drink order, nothing. I've been working in restaurants for about 15 years, and I never complain about something like this, but that was not right at all. They should take care of guests while stocking the bar.

There wasn't a wait for our table which was awesome & the food came out quickly...but our server was ehh... Maybe he was having a bad day? So I noticed that we had DIRTY dishes on our table. We asked for new plates, which he did bring out, unfortunately he failed to take the dirty ones back with him. \u00a0 We had to TELL him to take the dishes back because we weren't going to use them. Quite embarrassing and pretty gross. Based on the experiences that I've had here so far, they are either a hit or miss. Most recent visit I was charged $130 on my card when it should have been $30. Noticed this as I was looking at my checking account. I had to call the manager and talk to him about what happened. Apparently our server charged the entire bill on my card when it was supposed to be a split check. Didn't really make sense because I signed for $30 including a cash tip so it was kinda sketchy that he charged the whole bill on my card afterwards. Kind of makes me wonder what would have happened if I didn't catch this \"mistake\".

This update review is just to update some of the food that i have tried here at the yardhouse, - Chicken Nachos- Super bomb! Try it, i know nachos are simple but this nacho is simply delicious to mee. Great with beer!- Cheddar Bacon Burger- This was a really good burger that was cooked medium and was soo nice and juciy! Great with beer!- Appetizer Ribs- These ribs are flavorful but there was a lil too much sauce for my liking of these ribs.- Chicken & Avocado sandwich- This was a simple sandwich and i thought tasted like most chicken and avocado sandwichs i have eaten. They use a wheat bun which i think would go more better if they used a better bread but what do i know because i aint no chef so that's just my opinion.I've been here several times with newbies that wanted to check out the hype so i wanted to add that the service the most part is good but depending how packed it is your service can be badddd.

As far as the dishes, the turkey pot pie is HUGE. 2 people could split one. Same for the grilled romaine appetizer salad. Their portions tend to be large. Not as large as Cheesecake Factory, but close. Food is better at Yard House though...there's no comparison. Other things I'd recommend are the Chicken Enchilada Stack, Ahi Poke, Truffle Fries and the Onion Ring Tower. If you like pastrami their pastrami sandwich is pretty good as well.Service has been decent every time I've come here too. Just avoid the dinner hours and you will be fine. I've sat at the bar area a few times and the service is good there as well. The bar area gets very crowded though, and unless you come early, it can be very difficult to get a seat, especially during happy hour. Forget about finding a seat at the bar at dinner time. You will be lucky to find a place to stand. You will probably have to wait 10-15 minutes for a bar seat during the weekend afternoons though.I had to deduct a star because of the ridiculous wait time. I noticed them being VERY inefficient at turning around tables. Many tables were sitting idle for a good 20 minutes before a new party was seated. That no doubt added to the wait time. I also witnessed a couple people squat at a table as another group left..sitting at the table with their drinks before that table got bussed. They even got served food while they sat there. None of the staff noticed (or cared) which is weird since it was a party of 3 sitting at a table big enough for 6. It was also weird since I noticed staff kicking people off other tables that had been bussed.If you come, make sure you avoid the Friday and Saturday evening time. The wait is 2 and a half hours at a minimum then. Plus, by the time you finish eating dinner you won't be able to order dessert because the kitchen will be closed. They usually start shutting down the kitchen about an hour before closing so be aware.The wait is usually 30 minutes to an hour at other times. They will not accept call-aheads if it gets too busy either. If you insist on dining during dinner hours, your best bet is showing up BEFORE 6PM and putting your name on the list.

For a dish that included a lot of my favorite ingredients (shitake mushrooms, edamame, asparagus, etc...), it wasn't very good or flavorful. It almost tasted like nothing. Granted, Xanh doesn't really put anything in their garlic noodles to make it a stand-alone dish, but I still love the flavor much better.

On top of that, I just get a cool vibe, it's generally always a good time hanging out here.Off the happy hour menu, I ordered the Chinese Garlic Noodles, which is similar to the Chicken Garlic Noodles minus the chicken and asparagus. I asked for no cheese and my dish came out a bit more buttery then it should've. Maybe they were trying to make up for flavor? The food was cooked well though, minus the buttery-ness and I love butter so of course I finished my plate pretty quick. My friends all ordered REALLY tasty looking dishes. My friend had a chicken marsala that I tried and fell in love with. The happy hour menu is pretty good. If you go during lunch/happy hour, you're spending a typical price for lunch. I also ordered the goblet size of a strawberry flavored beer that the waitress described to me as more of a hard cider but has a higher alcohol content then the beer. I really enjoyed that drink. I believe it's a really popular drink. I'll update this review when I think of the name.Overall, I enjoyed myself as well as the food. I would definitely keep the same drink for next time and change up my meal and try something new. All my friends had a great time as well. For now, it remains 4 star.

I ordered a caesar salad, which was excellent - perfectly seasoned and dressed with homemade croutons and homemade parmesan chips - and the (Mac and Cheese)2 - campanelle noodles with cheddar and parmesan cheese, chicken, smoked applewood bacon, some earthy mushrooms, and truffle oil. Pretty good, but not amazing. The pasta was a little oily, but overall the flavors worked well together and the dish was satisfying. Our server was great as he helped me pick my dish after I asked him for recommendations (they have an extensive menu), checked up on us every once in a while, and our glasses of water were always full.

Their Hef was alright, I ended up going with a pint of their Leffe. They also sell their beers in what they call a \"Half a Yard\" which are these big big tall glasses that are about 2.5 pints. I then flip the page and again overwhelmed by so many menu items that all sounded delicious. They seemed to have everything! We ended up ordering the Garlic Noodles, Crab Cakes, and Ahi Crunchy salad for appetizer. You can add and of their soups for only $2.95 with an entree so we also got some Clam Chowder. The garlic noodles and Ahi Crunchy was memorable! Pretty good in terms of taste and flavors. The Ahi was a little bit salty for me but still good nonetheless.For entree, I shared a Parmesen Crusted Chicken served on top of Mashed Potatoes. This was also pretty good, similar to Gordon Biersch's. Their entrees are pretty huge and good to share. For dessert, they brought me out a birthday surprise Chocolate Lava Cake which I devoured in minutes. That was yummy for sure!It was fun.

We first went to the one in San Diego almost three years ago and have been hyping it up ever since. How often do you come across a restaurant, a chain nonetheless, with good food and well over 100 beers on tap? Yeah, pretty much never. It left such an impression on us that there were even some emails to corporate, politely inquiring, not begging at all, as to when they would open in the Bay Area. When word finally hit that one was coming to Santana Row, we were ecstatic, even though it's hardly among our favorite areas. The original plan was to go opening day, right at 11 am, but feeling uninspired, we didn't make it there until early evening. As expected, it was a madhouse and we were crazy enough to wait two hours just to experience our local Yard House. What was my ever important opinion, you ask? Well the beer list, with 130 on tap is impressive, but our tastes are far more refined than they were a few years back. Still, there are plenty of options and our table was content with the Young's Double Chocolate Stout, Mirror Pond Black Butte and K\u00f6stritzer Schwarzbier that we ordered. The food is what really stands out and is the main thing that will bring us back. One of my favorites is the garlic noodles. For an appetizer at around $7 you get a massive plate of flavorful carbs. Maybe the whole chain aspect skews my opinion, but regardless, I'm a fan.Our stay wasn't terribly long because having waited forever, we were just ready to try it out and get out of there. It was incredibly hectic and loud, as to be expected. I'm looking forward to going again soon maybe on a random weekday off. I would say when it dies down, but in my experience I don't think it will anytime soon.One major difference that I noticed is that this location only has happy hour once a day and not twice like the other locations I've been to. Maybe that's a company wide change, but I really think they ought to bring that to this location.

I talked to the manger and he was able to seat us a few mins later.We got seated and waited another 30 mins before the food came out, but that was understandable because we had so many people i knew it would take a while for the food to come out. The food was average at best, Not worth 2 hours and 30 min wait. The best part was just spending time drinking beers with my friendsMy favorite beer at yard house is \"White Lighting\" its the only beer i get. As for the food my order:-Truffle Fries - Super thin fries with herbs and shredded parmesan-Pastrami Sliders- 4 sliders and comes with thin crispy fries-Hawaiian Poke Stack (HH)- Chucks of tuna, carrots and bean sprouts.

It is the new hip place to go to in Santana Row and it is always super full. They don't take reservations and the wait here is at least over an hour+ during peak hours. I suggest not coming here with large parties because the wait might even be longer! The lighting inside is pretty dark with dim lights and, loud music and loud people. A really nice place to watch games around the bar area. There are flat screen tvs surrounding the bar and all over the restaurant so you can never miss out! The customer service here is pretty good here. Our first server, however was a total beezy. Now, I'm not gonna name any names here because that can be hurtful, but not only did she look like she had too much botox, every time we tried to ask her a question or order food/drinks, she would cut us off and not even acknowledge us in a very rude manner with rude remarks and attitude. I mean, I understand it's super busy en all, I would get pretty tired running around all day, but that's no excuse for the poor service. I'm sure there are other people out there who would appreciate and have fun if they had your job. Anyway, our second server came along to take over our first servers shift and was just so sweet, attentive and helpful that we forgot all about the rude server from before. She recommended different types of beer for us and even gave us a couple of samples. She would be running around constantly checking up on us, making sure we got our order and if it wasn't here yet she would go check and see whats up. There are too many beers to choose from at YH.. I suggest maybe starting out with the 6 packs because they give you 6 shots of different beer and can probably help you figure out what you like and what you don't like -- if you don't already know. Great place to hang out, chill, get drunk at, but the food is questionable. Do not order the macaroni and cheese. It was flavorless and oily to the max. I tried a couple of appetizers -- the truffle fries,sweet potato fries and devil eggs were good. I'm not too big of a fan on the main course dishes, although I've heard the garlic noodles were bomb.

I don't mean an obnoxious beeping in the background, I mean an ear-splitting screech of a fire alarm. It went off every 15-20 minutes for the better part of an hour.

After all of that, she accidentally brought me the non-vegetarian version of the wild mushroom mac & cheese. My companions said that if they were just going to toss it, they'd eat it, but apparently this registered with the waitress as charging us for the wrong order as well. If we'd realized that was what she was going to do, we would have let her just take it away. (Were they going to give it to someone else? That's kind of disturbing.) I've had this sort of mix-up happen before at other restaurants, and the waitstaff have definitely left the erroneous dish for my companions before without charging for it because it's not something they can serve to another customer anyway, so I was miffed about that.Once my actual dish came out, it was okay, but the mushrooms were over-crisped, in some cases to the point of being kind of hard; I suspect that perhaps these were re-hydrated wild mushrooms that didn't get fully re-hydrated. From my friends' account, something similar was going on with the mushrooms in the non-vegetarian version, so this may not have been the best dish to order during a busy time.I'm not sure if I'll come here again after the spotty service and meh food (although I concede that the truffle fries are a winner), but I have several friends who like beer, so I'm not ruling it out just yet.", "Date": "2013-04-04", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Lan A.", "ReviewID": "F3I3hgpKqEYpcigjPVS-UA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great service, delicious garlic noodles, pear and cheese flatbread, veggie chicken wings and chocolate souffle.MMM-good!!Love the darkened, metallic retro interiors too!", "Date": "2013-08-13", "Author_Location": "Santa Clara, CA"}, {"Author": "Anuran C.", "ReviewID": "VeluE-zFH7mRH9Qa7f6h9g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great atmosphere, great food.", "Date": "2013-08-13", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Melissa P.", "ReviewID": "xKs_EHnjINon5V9TOXaZBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well worth the wait.

I decided to go during happy hour on Friday starting at 3 and damn was it still sooo busy. There wasn't a wait for a regular table but if you wanted a high table, you had to wait. And there was definitely no place to sit at the bar. This was right at 3 too.We got there and had to wait about 30-40 mins for a high table around the bar but I thought it was worth the wait because we got to sit there the entire time without anyone pushing us out. Our waitresses were really \u00a0nice in letting us do that. When we got our table, I ordered their Timmerman's Strawberry and my boyfriend for their half-yard of Racer 5. I loved my beer. Being a girl, it was super fruity and just a slight hint of bite just to remind you it was a beer. The Racer 5 was too bitter for my taste but my boyfriend loved it. We also ordered the Spicy Tuna roll which wasn't a roll at all but more of like a circular tartare. It was pretty good. Definitely bigger portion than I wanted cause we got kind of sick of it after a while.Our second round, I got another fruity beer, Lindeman's Framboise. This one didn't taste like beer at all. It tasted like raspberry soda or something like that and it was delicious. My boyfriend got 21st amendment brewery's Brew Free or Die! IPA which he said was similar to Racer 5 except it was less hoppy. We also got an order of sweet potato fries and a margherita pizza. The dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries was the only weird thing. I didn't like it because it was too sweet to dip with sweet potato fries. It tasted like maple syrup but again my boyfriend liked it so it's a preference thing. The pizza was super good. And cheap because of happy hour.So they offer a lot during happy hour, I think it would only be worth it going there during happy hour because 4 beers and 3 dishes, it wasn't too bad of a bill.

Pizza was awesome as well....thin, loaded with pepperoni and mushrooms. The Clam Chowder soup was very good as well. I ordered a 2nd beer and asked her to surprise me with another one.

I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. She wanted to try it out since she has never been here before and it was my first time as well. I started asking people about their experiences at the yard house and everyone told me how good the food was. So I was excited to try it out. I went their excited thinking I'm going to have a good time with some of my favorite people and I left so disappointed. Don't get me wrong I had a blast with my friends but the food I should have passed on. I am going to start off with the positives. The service was pretty good. It was really busy that day. We had dinner on a Sunday. The server was fairly attentive and would come every so often to see if we needed anything. I also liked the pineapple express drink that I ordered. It was yummy. I loved it. Now on to the negatives. I really disliked the food. I didn't know what to order and I finally decided on the New York sandwich that came with a side of sweet potato fries. Not only was it pricey but it was so disappointing. My sandwich had not flavor what so ever. I asked the server for a medium steak and it came out more well done if anything. The sweet potato fries didn't impress me much. They were cold when they reached our table and they were nothing spectacular. I would have rather enjoyed McDonald's fries because at least those fries are good. These were not. I didn't even finish my food because it was so blah. This place is so over rated.

The wait as I understood it, was close to 2 hours, which is rather absurd for a Thursday night IMO. I understand we had a big party though, so I won't dock them too much for that. Once we were in, they had to sit us at 2 different places, a table and a booth next to it. We ordered drinks, then food, and had the truffle fries, which were as good as they say. I've had them before but not from here, and they lived up to the hype. Only gripe here is that for a table with about 9 of us, we asked the server how many orders was enough, and he said two, and then came out with these small baskets of fries....two wasn't even close, we could have finished 4 in all likelihood. Service was good considering the large amount of people in our party and how busy it was. Got the Belgian sampler which is a small glass of 6 of their Belgian-styled beers. Most were pretty good, all have high alcohol content. Their regular sampler had Sapporo in it....what the heck....seriously, Sapporo? Had the Spicy Jambalaya with pasta, liked that they offered with pasta or rice. Jambalaya was good, better than other places I've had it...actually spicy and not just tomato sauce. Lots of crawfish and sausages, and 2 jumbo prawns on top. Only issue was the portions vs. the price was a bit high. Got the Clam Chowder with that and that was definitely fresh-made, it didn't taste canned at all, which is quite refreshing. Atmosphere is very, very loud and it is very hard to hear people in there without borderline shouting, even if they are next to you. Not a place to go if you're looking for a quiet night out. All in all a good experience but I'd only ever come back if the wait was much less.

I'm of course going to give it another try but hopefully my next visit will earn it a 5 star rating.My friend ordered the french onion soup which tasted delicious except for the fact it was barely luke warm. So she asked if they could just heat it up and of course they did. Which only melted the cheese a little and the temperature was still the same as it was when served. When it was first served the cheese wasn't even melted. She ordered the ahi crunchy salad which was the star of the meal between both of ours. It was light, fresh, and full of delicious flavor. I'm a huge fan of ahi and the only change I'd make is requesting the dressing on the side. Otherwise I want to go back so I can have this instead of my original order. I had gotten the chicken pot pie and it was impressive big the flavor didn't wow me. Crust was nice and flaky, the inside of it wasn't the same as you'd see in normal pot pies. It looked like there wasn't enough sauce as other pot pies always have had. The fillings overall was good but not my favorite.

Right behind our server was Yard House Security that told us we needed to leave before we signed the check! \u00a0Security stood at our table like we were doing something wrong and needing to be monitored. May I add that it was only 30 minutes after we were sat! \u00a0I have never seen nor been treated this way at a restaurant! \u00a0I have worked many years as a server and you NEVER make a guest feel that they need to leave. Don't they have some side work or cleaning that needs to done? \u00a0He still stood over our table until we left saying nothing. I felt harassed. I will never go back to that Yard House and the 100 people we worked with the next day we told them all of the horrendous service we received! \u00a0If people were looking to leave early, then they should have not sat us. Upon leaving, I noticed that there were many tables with dirty dishes. Shouldn't they be focusing on cleaning the dining room instead of kicking out their guests? I believe in word of mouth service and upon telling our colleagues, many people have told us that they experienced service issues as well! \u00a0Yard house corporate needs to get involved! \u00a0This is unacceptable and appalling that they stay in business. \u00a0This pertains only to this location. The Roseville one has exceptional service and other colleagues that said the ones in SoCal also have much better service.

Its literally the most popular place in Santana Row/TOWN! Granted they do have an awesomely large variety of beers on tap and super happy hour menu. Yet, the grotesquely long lines on the weekends completely discourage me from ever coming on weekends. They don't do reservations after 8pm if your group comes after that time, be prepared to wait 2-3 hours to get inside. As for food, I only come here for happy hour since the other dishes on the menu tend to be more expensive, I've only tried the jambalaya which was spicy but good. As for happy hour, we always end up getting the ahi poke stack, ahi tuna, garlic noodles(yummy!) the hawaiian poke stack (fried onion rings) and we love their truffle fries with maple syrup dipping sauce! Their pizzas are pretty good as well and sometimes we get the yardhouse half yard beer(equivalent to 2 1/2 glasses of beer) only offered during happy hour 3-6pm. Yardhouse has late happy hour from 10-12am but they dont offer half yard discount. Overall, this place is great for hanging out with friends, watching sports and its one of the hippest places in Santana Row. I highly advise that unless you wanna spend a long ass time waiting in line, be sure to come here only during early happy hour or before happy hour starts. Anticipate 45 minute wait time.

Sure I bet there's tasty foods you can come here for on that birthday dinner with your 12 friends but if you ain't gettin' beer, you're missing a big chunk of the experience (and not the lambics and ciders mind you!). I like the yard house because the beer selection is off the hook. The food: well, it really is just your usual either overpriced or upscale (however you wanna look at it) funky fusion. But the beer! Well, they charge the right amount (about 6-7 for a pint. You're a fool if you order one of those tallboys of anything but the bud...even then you're still a fool. This ain't vegas, son!) and you get a really amazing selection of hard to get beers. I had the ommegang Belgian blonde, the Kostrizer Dark, Lost Coast great white, and I think a repeat of one of these. The kostritzer was great: light weight, chocolatey yet smokey body, with a clean, effervescent finish that left no aftertaste. Awesome for a dark I might add. But this isn't \u00a0a beer review! This is an institution review! Cool place: nice vibe, great decor (in terms of seating and table design), very friendly staff (as you might expect of the cheesecake factory of beer gardens). Crowded as hell (quite literally I bet!) but if you're not there to eat, the bartenders are about as efficient as you want them to be: johnny on the spot before and after order. Friends I came with ate stuff and a snagged a taste but it really is not too special. Like I said: Think cheesecake factory with 100 beers on tap. So in summation, I like this place but not for the food: the beer and the spot on service made me a happy camper.

So much for great service for it's first month of opening. This place gets overly crowded during happy hour and meal times. The normal wait time now varies from 45min to 1hr. The food is good, but there isn't really anything special about the food that would make you rave about it. After all, this place is best known for the beer. Apparently, there are over 150 beers on tap. (Every time I ask a server how many beers are on tap, they would each give me different numbers. They really need to know their stuff if they're going to work in a high end area) No matter where you are seated, you will always have a view of a TV with any sports game that would be currently showing. They almost always only show sports. I've had the Timmerman Raspberry beer (or strawberry? Can't quite remember) and a chocolate beer with a scoop of ice cream in it. Both were very good and different. Truffle fries are good for tasting while you sip on your beer and wait for your food to arrive.The Country fried chicken steak on top of mash potatoes is actually something I normally order when I come here. It's really tasty, the chicken is moist, the mash potatoes are done right with corn in it, and the gravy is to die for. It's a big portion so I always end up taking leftovers home (but that's normal for most of their dishes.) I also had the Korean BBQ appetizer.

I had ordered a plate of garlic noodles and split a burger with my friend. The patty in our burger was salted in a very uneven manner...some bites were pretty good, others were extremely salty. This goes for the garlic fries too, super unevenly salted. And this was confirmed by everyone who tried the burgers, so it wasn't just our luck. My order of chicken garlic noodles was very oily, as well as my friend's mac&cheese, which is supposedly one of Yardhouse's more popular dishes btw. However, in honor of my friend's birthday, she did get a free souffle with vanilla bean ice cream--which I thought was the only close to perfect item that any of us had tonight. Otherwise their food was not evenly season, super oily, and overpriced. I could have easily gotten that same measly plate somewhere else for way less than how much I paid here. And for the burgers, I would have gladly chosen The Counter in the same area or saved my gourmet burger needs for Umami. Service:Our waiter was super friendly, he always came to refill our waters. He was very patient and very detail-oriented. I pay a lot of attention on how many times a server comes around to check up on his/her tables and that's how I determine the difference between a less than or equal to 10% tip and a 15% tip. But our food took quite a while to come to us...and when we paid with cash for part of our bill, we didn't get any change. We wanted the change to see how much we should tip since we were there with a group, splitting the check is always a hassle.

Except for my last experience... SHOUTOUT to one of the worst waitresses I've ever had, JASMINE. Not only was she rude & unprofessional, but she had the worst attitude. I was with a party of about 13 & already she started the night off complaining b/c before we were sat, some of our group had already bought drinks at the bar. Sorry we didn't know you're not allowed to buy drinks from the bar & take it to the table once your party has been called?!? I really think she just wanted it on her tab for a bigger tip, but she claimed it was because she had to \"MONITOR\" our alcohol consumption. Whatever, that wasn't really a big deal yet.. So, the last 2 members of our party come back from the bar, Jasmine's face drops & here comes the attitude. She glares at the birthday girl & exclaims that we're not allowed to buy drinks at the bar, yadda yadda yadda... & my friend tells her \"why are you even looking at me, I don't control what people want to do\". As Jasmine is saying her speech again, she brings out some wanna-be ghetto attitude & raises her hand while she talks swaying it back & forth in front of our faces. OH HELL NO. DON'T EVER RAISE YOUR HAND BACK IN FORTH IN YOUR CUSTOMER'S FACES. If there was really a big issue, she shoulda brought her manager to handle it instead of tryna cop an attitude. Not only, did she ignore us after our orders were taken, but she would be very short with our group & not once did we ever see a smile or hear a genuine word out of her mouth. I also see her walk to the front table and start to talk smack about our party b/c she is clearly rolling her eyes to the hostess upfront & pointing with her head in our direction. LASTLY, THIS IS THE DISGUSTING PART: Once everyone's food came, (my fries came towards the end), I ask her for a side of ranch & she says ok. I see her walk to the other side of the table where my friend is sitting eating his burger & fries & she asks if she can take the ranch (assuming he wasn't using it or didn't use it already). Then she picks it up, walks back to my side of the table & gives it to me. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!? \u00a0She couldn't just go to the kitchen & get my a fresh, new side of ranch?? I understand that he's my friend & I even coulda just asked him to give me some of his ranch, but she is a waitress & that is probably one of the rudest, most UNSANITARY things I've ever experienced. By the end of the night, we spoke to the manager, BOBBY, who was very understanding. He was genuinely concerned & disgusted at how we were treated. He agreed to take off the gratuity AND provide the birthday girl with a complimentary dessert trio. Thank you so much Bobby for handling the situation with poise, respect & consideration. With that said, I as well as my friends will be back to Yardhouse in the future. The service (except for this time) has always been top notch with some of the friendliest servers I've ever seen. The food is excellent & the happy hour can't be beat. The beers are unique & the atmosphere is exceptional. I just hope to see that the waitress Jasmine has an attitude adjustment or can receive some training as to how to treat her guests.

Overall, this probably has the best quality food for a sports bar with a wide variety (e.g. not just chicken wings).

The size is huge and the Balsamic dressing is amazing.-Big venue with lots of TVs.-Upper level is filled with kegs piped down to an oval shaped bar with 360 degree access.-Prices are competitive for food quality. Burgers are around $10. Sandwiches are up to $15 or 16. Entrees can be more for more expensive steak and seafood cuts.Cons:-Lots of TVs, but no sound from the TVs (Minus 1 star). They pump in music all the time. Even during big games. I really wish they had a way to listen to games. This is a deal breaker to come during a big game. It makes it a lot less of the \"sport\" in sports bar.-Also can get quite noisy during happy hour and dinner. It's not a spot to have a conversation with a large group.Other items:-The menu is HUGE. It's deceiving because a lot is beer and drinks. The food selection is still pretty large.

Yard House corporate called me this afternoon, and offered me a gift card to re-visit them. A new review will be up soon! That being said, I am impressed with Yard House's quick response to my review as well as the measure they have taken to fix this. The incident last night is probably more of a one-off rather then a reflection of Yard House's full attitude._______________________We got the worst of service last night. That being said, it was not my first time to Yard House and I had experienced much better. In fact, my group and I were there earlier this week (Monday night) to celebrate a friend's birthday and we were wonderfully served by Jessica. She was great throughout the night and we were so impressed that we decided to come back Thursday night for another friend's birthday. BIG MISTAKE.First, the wait. We had to switch from a party of 6 to 8 as more people were joining us. When I told the hostess that, she told me very rudely to stand in a corner and wait for the manager to come talk to us. Ten minutes later and still no one talked to us. I went up to her again and asked for details and to my surprise, nothing had been done and I was still on the small table list! I asked for them to switch my name to the big table list immediately in front of me instead of waiting for someone to come talk to us (I don't know what the policy on that is and why is that) We ended up waiting an extra half hour in addition to the original hour they told us. (we got there about 630 and got seated about 8)That in all was still acceptable. Yard House is a busy establishment, we know. We were willing to overlook that in anticipation of celebrating my friend's birthday and the wonderful food and service that we got like Monday night.Boy, were we in for a surprise!The moment we sat down at our table, our server, Krystal (I think that's how you spell it) did not even greet us or smile. She asked us what we wanted to start with, just like that. Mind you, it was a big party and some people had not even settled down yet, let alone open our menus. She kept rushing us what we wanted to order. I ordered a half yard cider and since only me and another friend were drinking, she kept walking around us to make sure of that, LIKE WE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED. This was particularly felt when I asked for an empty glass to pour the half yard to myself, she kept insisting to check the ID of whoever was drinking it. I told her it was me and she rolled her eyes like she did not believe me.We were not happy then but still willing to overlook that since we were a group of people over and under 21 and understood the concern of our server.Whatever happened next was the worst. Our server kept hovering over our table and refilled water even when we did not ask her to. Every time she refilled our water glass, she would slam it down in front of us. It got so bad that droplets of water flew onto my friend's food. When we told her that we did not want our waters filled anymore, (as we wanted to avoid a scene) she went ahead and filled it anyway (and again, rolling her eyes) and proceeded to slam plates of our food onto our table.Also, when my one friend who was drinking had finished his half yard and ordered pints instead, the waitress refused to serve him until he chugged everything down. He did not want whatever that was in the half yard anymore! He wanted a new one. She could have just taken the glass away but instead, she said she would not serve him until he finished it. Talk about attitude!With that being said, I made a complain to the manager and he was nice about it. I told him that we could not eat in peace with someone walking around us all the time and slamming things onto our table. He told us that we were being closely watched as we ordered 2 half yards and 5 empty glasses. NO? we had 2 half yards and 2 empty glasses for me and my friend. Talk about miscommunication. I was very angry at this point and told him if he wanted, he could conduct a breathalyzer check on us. So much for trustworthiness. He apologized again and agreed to change our server, but it was too late. At this point, we were all too upset and just wanted to leave. The manager said that he would do something to \"make up for the birthday boy\" and a birthday souffl\u00e9 was served to us. This is not our first birthday spent there and we happen to know that this place gives out free souffl\u00e9 to everyone celebrating a birthday. No big deal.When we got our bill, gratuity was included. We wanted to ask to take it off but such an unpleasant dining experience just prompted us to pay and get out of there as soon as possible. I forgot my scarf when I left and had to return to get it, I saw our original rude and mistrusting server grabbing our tip instead of the new server. While doing so, she was rolling her eyes again and talking smack about us to her other servers. I know this because she kept pointing at our empty table while making rude gestures.", "Date": "2012-11-16", "Author_Location": "Cupertino, CA"}, {"Author": "Victoria L.", "ReviewID": "r2gKjJI9UmmqZJgmTkhauQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TYRONE IS THE BEST WAITER THERE!

One quick tidbit though: it is important to time yourself accordingly. On the weekday evening I went, my friends and I were informed by our server they'll stop serving food at 11pm and promptly close the entire restaurant at exactly midnight. So, yes, there are particular limits to all the good times. However really, don't let that deter you from visiting - from the moment you enter, the contemporary modern design dotted with an industrial feel captures your imagination; yes, the draw is definitely for ambiance and for the reflectively better rock music blasting from the speakers. What about the food? Well, the Asian/American inspired fusion mix from the menu leaves a favorable impression on the pallet, and it's priced right. Especially if you go during a Happy Hour excursion, where they offer parts from the menu at half-off. As for me, I liked the Grilled Ahi Tuna Steak Sandwiches, with the onion relish; to me the decent portions on this delectable dish, when washed down with a Shocktop makes for something of a fulfilling experience.

I decided to order the chicken lettuce wraps, which sounded really good! Unfortunately, right when I was about to spoon some of the filling into my lettuce cup, I noticed a bug on the piece of lettuce. It was like a fly or little black bug. I told my waiter, and she brought another stack of new lettuce. I thought, ok, this time it should be clean. Unfortunately, I was wrong! I found another bug in my new stack of lettuce. I told the waiter again, and she seemed a little annoyed to have to go back and bring me another stack. She never even apologized for the bugs in my lettuce either time, she just said \"Oh.\" I would've appreciated it if the waiter at least apologized, and it would've been even nicer if they were able to not charge me for that appetizer. I'm glad my third stack of lettuce didn't have bugs in it. At least I know the food is really fresh and organic if there's still bugs on it haha The second time I went, I was glad to not find any bugs in the chicken lettuce wraps we ordered! We also went during happy hour, and I have to say the food was really good. The spicy tuna roll and hawaiian poke stack are amazing, very healthy too! got the ham & pineapple pizza, btw their pizzas are huge, and some sliders which were juicy and flavorful.

But it's a restaurant with a very extensive bar. 113 beers on tap that's great. Hey Alcoholics this place has good food for you. Fellow foodies, this place is good for a good time with booze. Come here for the booze. So what else was it? I let go of the fact that the place is new and should be packed so waiting for a table is forgiven. I can even forgive the hostess almost brought us to a table for the wrong server. Well the third strike was the wait to get are food and beverages.The servers didn't know which table to drop off our food. My group watched a food runner with our food walk around our table searching for the table to put the food on.While that was humorous I was hoping they would have been better prepared with a table number to go to. None of the food runners seemed to know where to go. The drinks came at irregular times which was surprising. Timing is a factor when a restaurant is working and when we get things at different times the friends have to wait out of courtesy to the other friend before we can eat or drink.A high note were the Truffle fries, very good. And the crab artichoke dip was okay. But I didn't care for the Seared scallops orzo tomato pasta with truffle jus. My friends can agree with the fries and dip but they didn't care for the Jambalaya or the Chicken Maceroni and cheese with truffle either. That stacked the bill for sub par food with excellent beer.Lesson learned. I will be back for sure just for beer and the truffle fries. I will probably try the other appetizers but never again an entree. The desserts were decent but I wouldn't rave about them.

It was good the first time, but the second visit....I really don't know how to explain it. I left as a very unhappy customer in regards to customer service. My friend took me out for a late birthday dinner, and our orders was very simple. We only ordered two main entrees. We did not order any drinks, appetizers, or even desserts. Let's put this out there right now that I am very understanding and sympathizing person. I know it's tough working in the food industry and dealing with customers especially when it's busy. However, how could you possibly screw up our only two dishes??!! My friend had fish and chips and I ordered a gorgonzola burger. Our waitress took down our order as if she knew the back of her hand. The food took awhile to come out which I was okay with. Once it came out, I took a bite without looking at my burger because I didn't think she would screw it up. \u00a0After my bite, I saw a big green bell pepper with the beef patty. \u00a0Before I tried to wave our waitress down, I want to make sure that it was NOT the burger I ordered. I never had a gorgonzola burger, but I clearly remembered that there are mushrooms in it from the description on the menu before ordering. It took a long time for her to come. When she finally came, I told her that it was the wrong burger. She even confirmed it with me a few times when she first took our orders, and she even said the name of my burger before looking at it. After looking at it, she went to check. She came back apologizing that she entered my order wrong. I am like really? you didn't bother double checking what you entered especially when it's ONLY 2 ITEMS? She asked me if I would like the kitchen to make my original order. I told her it's okay because I didn't want to waste food. (Luckily, I can eat peppers.) Then she told me that she will speak to the manager to give us complimentary desserts or take my order off the bill. As I was eating the wrong burger, she apologized once again when pass by our table to cater other tables. She didn't check with us or anything the whole time we were there. I did not enjoy that burger at all. I could barely finished it because it was not good. When she finally gave us the bill, I asked my friend if I can see it. And you know what? she didn't do anything to compensate for her mistake or give us an update from her manager. We ended up paying the bill but she wouldn't pick it up even though she passed by our table 5-6 times. It was really frustrating!! When she finally picked it up, we waited forever to get it back. Also, we were annoyed by other customers who were standing and leaning on our chairs since we were placed near the bar. The whole \u00a0experience was horrible! with customers leaning on your chair, your waitress messed up your order and didn't do anything about it, and didn't come to \u00a0check up on us even though she passed by numerous times. She's probably think that it's better to provide her attention to large groups at the other tables since they will be tipping more.

When I walked in and had a great smile and a \"Hi\" for whoever was going to greet me, I was welcomed with 3 hostesses/waitresses who were talking about their personal business and had 3 unhappy/unpleasant looks on their faces. And the response I get was, \"Four? There's a wait.\" Ugh! Awful. Two from out party decide to go check out the bar and to get a beer. We waited 20-25 minutes for a table when we saw a whole bunch of dirty, empty ones around. When I went to retrieve the other two, I find out that not one bartender or employee had approached them the entire time they were sitting at the bar, nor did one even come close enough for them to waive them down. Terrible. If you're going to run a huge place like that, make sure you have an attentive staff please. The menu is huge and takes time to look through, kind of irritating when you've never been there and want to look at everything they offer. The truffle fries were absolutely amazing, gotta love that truffle oil. Thank goodness something good came out of this. Mac & Cheese was undercooked, rubbery, and dry. The vodka pasta with shrimp was alright but lacking in flavor. I ordered a fish dish recommended by our waitress (who was nice) and the fish was grossly overdone, made it extremely dry and inedible. Poor beautiful fish. I was then approached by a manager who apologized many times and asked if I wanted it off the bill. I told him I was taking everything the fish was on but \u00a0not the fish and it was placed on the bill anyway. $30 for mashed potatoes and veggies, geez. The manager also told me I should have said something sooner when they might have gotten me something else.. like I want to order something that when it arrives everyone else is done with their meals. There was a lot of food anyway, I didn't need \u00a0to order something else.

We randomly decided to out to dinner and one of us recommended this place. I quickly went on yelp to see how the reviews and I hesitated to go cause it only got a 3.5 stars. But then she kept insisting that it's really good. So we arrived here around 8:40, got our name on the list and the hostess told us to check back again in an hour. So we went around Santa Row and came back to the restaurant again 9:30 and we got that one pager thingy and waited another 20 mins until we were seated. It was a really busy night since people were watching the Sharks game and then the baseball game afterwards. Anyways, they have a really big extensive menu and it was overwhelming to decided what to eat..or drink..they have a huge wine n beer menu too. So we ordered: Fruit Beer: BBC Strawberry Blonde; This was good...it has a very strong strawberry taste..just like strawberry juice. You can't really taste the beer at all.Cherry Limeade: This drink is just like the same anywhere...fruity..but it was a tad sweet for me.Classic Sliders: Mini-hamburgers..this was what my friend liked the most..but I thought it was just normal..nothing really special about it. I think the pork sliders I have at Fuzio tasted alot better. New York Steak and Fries: OMG...the steak was soooo juicy and the butter that they put on top of the steak makes it soooo good. It just melts away in your mouth with the juicy steak. We got garlic fries along with this and the fries tasted like the truffle fries at Alexander's Steakhouse.My friend ordered this and I had a piece and I just loveee it..I would definitely come back here and get this next time.Jerk Chicken with Shrimp Stack: This dish was just okay for me..I tried the chicken..it was good..but nothing to hyped about. I didn't try the shrimp, but my friend said it was pretty good. Seared Ahi Steak Sandwich: This is what I ordered..and OMG..It was delicious. This also came with the same truffle fries..I could only manage to finish half the sandwich and shared the rest. It's hard for me to really decided if this is better or the steak is better...I just love both dish soo much. The sandwich has a very good sauce with it, with a big piece of seared ahi tuna steak..you will love it!Mini Apple Cobbler: This was what we ordered for dessert and it was the perfect way to end the meal. The apples were hot and sweet at the bottom, while the peach is kinda sour above..topped with crumbs and a scoop of caramel ice cream..best way to end the meal!The total for all this came out to be 101 w/o tip. Overall, I really enjoy the food here and the service was superb for us. Our server came and check up at least 4x during our meal to make sure we don't need anything, and by the time the check comes..he was pretty quick with it. I would totally come back here again..I probably will next week! It's totally worth the wait!

Yard House doesn't take reservations unless you have a party of 10+ and it must be made before 4pm the day of (picky, picky..).. I arrived promptly at 8 and was not seated until 9:20.. I know that Friday nights are usually very busy for restaurants so we wouldn't be seated right away, but compound that fact with a newly opened restaurant and the wait time will easily double or triple.. This place is kind of chaotic because there were 20 people waiting inside by the entrance, another handful of people waiting outside the entrance, and large groups of people waiting downstairs in the main dining room by the bar watching the Warriors game on one of many TVs that they offer.. They have an awkward table right by the entrance that seats about 10 people, and the reason it could get weird is because you have the people still waiting for tables within an inch or two of you while you're eating.. The same story goes for the raised tables that surround the bar.. We had drunk and eager Warriors fans resting their drinks or their arms on our table while we were eating.. Something positive about this place is the impressive number and display of their TVs though.. They are all positioned very strategically so that everyone gets a great view, and they have about 3 or 4 different programs on (mainly sports) so guests can choose which they would rather watch no matter where they're sitting..Now on to the food.. We had the calamari as an appetizer and between the 2 of us we weren't able to finish it all but it was very tasty! I had the ahi crunch salad for dinner and my friend had a custom personal sized pizza.. My salad had a very very strong flavor profile, so strong in fact that the ingredients seemed like they were fighting each other for attention.. I'm not sure what it was but it was overwhelming and difficult to enjoy.. I think this salad would have been much better if the flavors were a little more subtle.. The seared ahi was overly seasoned and I had to cut off the seared parts because they put so much pepper on it.. The strong taste of the pepper rind combined with the competing flavors in my salad were just unbearable.. I didn't get a chance to try the pizza so I have no comments on that and I didn't get the bill so I'm not sure how much it costs either haha [:Probably the coolest thing I saw at Yard House was their 1/2 yard (?) of beer that was layered with a honey-colored beer on the bottom half, and Guiness resting happily on the top half.. I've never seen this density trick done with beer and it was so beautiful I almost wanted to take a picture of someone else's drink!

At 7pm on a Saturday night, don't even bother. The wait is the same at TCF across the street, though. They don't take reservations, only for parties of 10 or more. So it was just the hubs and I. They informed us the wait would be about 50 minutes so we're like uhhh okay, just give us that damn pager. Pager in tow, we walk to the bar area (hooray for being 21) and look for seats. It's effing packed, too. But it's first come, first serve. We stand by a tv and reluctantly an elderly couple left after 10 minutes of us standing. I had looked on their website for the types of drinks they have and found the Honey Honey Blonde to be best suited for me, and I was right (it is a very light tasting beer, lighter than a Corona). The hubs tried the Gulden Draak, which is very dark since it is at a 10.5%! Anywho, we ordered something that wouldn't be too messy since we're at the bar (and when you're stoned it feels like everyone is watching you lol). He ordered the mac and cheese and I ordered the miso glazed sea bass which was pretty good. We definitely had to start with the truffle fries because I am a truffle addict. Ehh, they were okay. Took another order of the fries to-go, though. They card everyone here when you order alcohol, even if you're with a walker walking like Quasimoto--they'll still card you. It makes sense, they are a large restaurant and wouldn't want anything to jeopardize their business. They are famous for their half-yard beer glasses, which I guess is where the name comes from... But back to the truffle fries. They are regular skinny fries with an oregano/parmesan/truffle topping. NOT unlike the truffle fries at Alexander's... now THOSE are truffle fries. We even asked for more truffle on our to-go order and it was still sh*tty. It's affordable american fusion cuisine so what do you expect for $4. As we're finished with our meal, our pager goes off. Ha... nice one. Whatever. The bill was less than $70 for two people: 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 medium sized beer and 1 small beer.If you still want to eat here, try coming at a time when it is not packed (don't know when that time is) or if you're with a party of 10 or more so you can make a reservation. Or if you're with a couple of people and are willing to wait for seats at the bar area. Or if you just really want to be like all your trendy friends on instagram and take instagram pictures. They have wifi here for that. And good to watch the games here, too. Not too great for kids unless you're with that party of 10+ so you can be seated quickly.

I have tried maybe half of the happy hour items and I gotta say that the Pastrami sliders are super good. The pastrami was very moist and felt like it melted in your mouth.And the french fries are thin almost looking like fried onion strings and so addictive. If you like spinach and artichoke dip, they also have a Lobster Spinach Dip on their appetizer menu that is amazing. I like that they serve you parmesan giant pita chips as opposed to your typical tortilla chips; definitely makes a difference to me.If you're looking for things to share, all their pizzas are half off the original price. I've had their pepperoni and mushroom, ham and pineapple, and their spicy thai chicken pizzas. The spicy thai chicken is soo good. The crust on their pizzas are nice and crunchy but also fluffy on the inside of it. Drinks-wise, there is more beer here than I could ever imagine. I am definitely not a fan of beer unfortunately BUT I really like their Belgian Fruit and Lambic Ales because they are extremely fruity tasting (it practically tastes like fizzy juice) and doesn't have the typical beer after flavor. The Linderman's Framboise tastes like a really tart raspberry. I always get the Rose Garden now, which is actually a neat idea Yard House has of blending two different types of beer into one cup. The Rose Garden definitely has the distinct hint of the raspberry flavor of Framboise inside but has a nice sweet taste of the Hoegaarden White in it.

But clearly, we cant. I've heard SO many reviews from my friends to try out Yard House. So my friends and I went to the Yard House on a Saturday night. We got there around 1015pm, and the wait was about 20 minutes. But, that's fine..it's a saturday night so that's understandable. We all got drinks at the bar and chilled as we waited. Got sat at a table around 10:35. We ordered a couple more drinks. The server informed us that the kitchen was about to close at 11 and advised us to order soon. So, in retrospect, that was nice of the server to warn us. Another friend joined us so we ordered a couple of appetizers by 11. At this point, i was told to order the fries (from those very friends that told me to go to the Yard House). We decided to order the REGULAR fries just to try it out first. I'm not sure why the side of fries came out before the rest of the appetizers but doesn't matter at least it's something out. My friend and I really don't like any seasonings on the fries (hence why we order REGULAR fries) but we noticed that there was some cheese and parsley on the fries. We ate it and thought it was GARLIC fries...our other friends, who didnt even know that we ordered fries, even asked us if we ordered GARLIC fries. So that was a fail already. \u00a0The server came back around and informed us that the bar was closing at 11:30 (maybe because they were closing at 12?) i'm not sure. So my friends ordered some more drinks. by 11:45 one of the restaurant employees said to us \"we are closing in 15 mins so you need to finish up.\" They turned off all of their TV screens and turned on the normal lights. Fail #2 I'm not quite sure what the problem was. If they were closing at 12, then why rush us already? We just got our refill of drinks. But, ok. We tried to rush it. at 11:50 another employees comes up to us \"you need to hurry it up, we're closing at 12.\" Again, I'm not sure what the problem is...i've heard of restaurants closing their doors at 12 but not FORCING paying guests out. So, alright. We were almost done with our drinks so the girls went to the bathroom before they closed. At 11:55 the manager comes to us. I told her that the three girls were in the bathroom and that they would be right out. Sadly, the manager said \"you need to get off the table now. Grab the girl's purse, and you can finish your beer at the door.\" What the hell is going on? it's not even 12 yet! Then while we were waiting at the door for the girls, one of the bouncers told my friend to finish his beer then asked us to leave but said it was ok after we told him that we're waiting for the girls to leave the bathroom. In any case, one of the worst experiences that I've had at a restaurant. I usually give restaurants a second try but this type of \"forcing guests out by the time the restaurant closes\" seems to be a procedural process so I don't think it would be different on another day. If it wasn't for blowfish afterwards, our night would've been crap. First and last time coming to the Yard House.

However, they are seriously lacking in the customer service department, and isn't that what restaurants are all about, servicing?Our experience there wasn't bad, we came for a friend's birthday, and she was smart and made reservations. We were seated promptly and the waitress took our order. The music was a little too loud, because I had trouble hearing her.Their beer selection, is amazing. There is something there for everyone. I am not a big beer drinker, but I got the Timmermans Strawberry beer and IT. WAS. DELICIOUS. Trust me, if you don't like beer, just get this one. It was the perfect combination of sweet and fruityness, but it still had that hint of beer, but not overwhelmingly so that I still enjoyed it a lot. I want a 6 pack in my fridge!!The food we ordered came out in a timely matter, I liked the Lobster, crab & artichoke dip that we got, it went well with the soft pita bread and tortilla chips. And it seemed like the rest of the party liked their food.It was a birthday party, so one of my friends asked our waitress if they did anything, and she asked us what flavor we wanted, chocolate, lemon or apple. We went with chocolate, and later in the night she came out with a chocolate souffle with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was served in a ramekin on a large rectangular plate with a simple yet cool stenciled cocoa powder art that said BIRTHDAY on it. cute. and good too!Us girls ordered another round of drinks that took a teeny bit longer to get, but it did come, and then came the bill. We took care of the bill, and we were sitting around, enjoying the company, and then this guy (I have no idea who he is, but i HOPE he isn't the manger), came up to us and told us that they were closing up soon, and we said alright. I want to say this was 11:40, 11:45ish. So we're sitting here, having already paid, we just wanted to finish up our drinks, and that guy comes around AGAIN. Basically saying that we had to go. Check my cell phone, its only 11:50. Their hours say that they are open until 12, so why are they kicking is out now? i would understand if he was pushing us to leave if we were lingering after hours, but it was still within the posted hours! And it was not like we were the last ones there. Also, he only told OUR party that it was time to go, and he told us TWICE, when we had not heard him tell the party in the booth behind us, nor did he tell the patrons at the bar that they had to leave. So, we definitely felt singled out, and I don't know why because we were not a sloppy nor loud party. So we were very disappointed and frustrated with the service, so i REALLY HOPE that he is NOT the manager, because that is SAD SAD SAD. What's your problem dude.Also, another thing that was SUPER DUPER lame, was that they charged us for the birthday souffle for our friend! I have never, in all my life (a big whopping 2-3 haha), been charged for a birthday dessert! EVER! We were calculating the tab, and it was weird that we were under, and when we saw the birthday charge, it all made sense! So, that was pretty ridiculous. I wonder if we were the only ones!Anyway, so I'm really sad because overall I did like YardHouse (I really liked the Strawberry beer), and the food seems good, I really want to come back from the Truffle fries everyone is raving about, and these Chicken Nachos that my friend really likes... but after today's poor service, I'm not quite sure I really want to come back!! I'm sure I'll give them another chance though... because I didn't want to give them 1 star for their lousy service. Boo. If anything I recommend bringing your own birthday cupcake (lol), and coming not near the end of closing, unless you wanted to be treated like you have cooties and being shooed out of the restaurant.

Our waiter was really nice and helpful. He explained to us the kind of beer they have and recommended a few. He also kept coming to check up on us. \u00a0We got the calamari, the turkey sliders and the pizza and they were all good. The rose beer was also light and good tasting.2nd time we visit was for my bf's bday and we knew its going to be a busy night and already expected a 1-2 hr waiting time. Our friend already put our group and named down on the list. We went to consuelos for dinner and figured we will just go to the yardhouse for dessert and drinks when we get paged. we managed to get there on time and asked one of the hostess if our table is ready. Girl immediately \u00a0told me that the pager they gave us was reportedly broken so thats why it didn't page and our name isn't on any of the list.. she said it will be another 45mins on TOP OF THE 2 HR WAIT WE JUST DID!... I was calm and composed and told her \" well, why would someone give us a broken pager? that's not our fault and we've been waiting\". ...Guess what this hostess had the nerve to ask me..\"WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK TO OUR MANAGER?\"...So i quickly replied \" yes please\". the hostess then asked me who gave me the pager..and since it was my friend who got the pager, i went up to him and asked him who was he talking to...he said oh it was this girl named KAT. as i was walking up to the hostess, I freakin noticed her name tag and it says KAT!..so my friend walked up with me and pointed at her and said \" yeah, Kat ure the one who gave me the pager and my name down\". As this was happening the manager who she called to talk to me, was behind her. I explained to the manager what happened and he asked cat \" so their names are not on any of the list?\"...GUESS WHAT KAT SAID...\" no, its here\"...She was pointing at the same list she was holding earlier when she was talking to me and telling me our names aren't on there\". \u00a0What a sneaky liar!...SHE KNEW IT WAS HER FAULT ALL ALONG AND GOT AWAY WITH IT...AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE GOT A TABLE. BTW! SHE JUST SAVED HER ASS AND LIED TO HER MANAGER.Labor day was the 3rd time i decided to give yard house another chance. Was busy but not as busy. they told us, it will be a 35 min wait..so since my last incident was bad, i decided to put a timer on my phone the minute i got the pager. Walked around for just a lil bit. I even called \u00a0just to double check if we gotten page and we got back 10mins before my timer went off. I went up to the hostess and asked them if we got page and she said \" oh we page u 20mins ago\"...i told her, no u didn't cuz i have the pager on my hand this whole time. she tried to page it in front of me and it didn't work the first time..she did it again and it worked and she said \" see, it works\"...now i laughed sarcastically and said \" well, u realized it might have not gone thru the first time u paged me if u guys really did just like now\"?. \u00a0and plus its the pager that was obviously broken..cuz theres no way they woulda page me 10mins after i just got the pager. LIKE I SAID, THEY TRY TO MAKE UP EXCUSES for their very unorganized team and broken sets of pagers and BLAME IT ON THEIR CUSTOMERS!...IF THEY TRY TO PULL THIS ON YOU, DON'T PUT UP WITH IT!...TRUST ME ON THIS!...WORST HOSTESS AND SEATING PROCESS EVER! .

It had bits of chewy bacon and shiitake mushroom and chicken. \u00a0A layer of bread crumbs was sprinkled on top and put under the broiler to crisp and ensure a crunchy bite. \u00a0The shiitake mushroom is a good earthy balance with the creamy cheese and smokey bacon. \u00a0I didn't care for the chicken. \u00a0We also ordered lettuce wraps. \u00a0It was good but did not amaze my taste buds although this is a great alternative to many of the fried foods on the menu. \u00a0My friend ordered the classic burger that came out with shoestring fries. \u00a0Usually the thin fries comes out dry but these were moist and very delicious. \u00a0Our bartender, Robin was very helpful and tentative to us the whole night. \u00a0She took time while serving others to answer some of my questions about beer. \u00a0She obviously had some knowledge about how beer is created and very fun to talk to. \u00a0Service with a smile even through all the chaos and demanding patrons. \u00a0The beers I have tried:Amber: House AmberAnderson Valley Boont Amber-Both these beers are good choices if you like the amber beers (I'm sorry I can't properly describe these beers because I was not paying enough attention. \u00a0I was focusing on getting a seat)-I have also tried Smithwick's but not at Yardhouse. \u00a0I also recommend this beer as a great amber beer. \u00a0Fruity:-Timmerman's strawberry: I thought they gave me strawberry soda. \u00a0It did \u00a0not taste like beer at all. \u00a0The color was a strange rose blond color-Lost Coast Apricot Wheat: This beer had a floral, apricot taste to it. \u00a0It's a light beer with the cloudy wheat look to it. \u00a0If you like blue moon, you'll probably like this beer also. \u00a0White Ale:Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat: \u00a0Do you like the cereal Fruity Pebbles? Then you will like this beer.-I have also tried some other beer on this list but just not at Yardhouse. \u00a0I recommend Great White for the floral, coriander taste and Hoegaarden for a crisp, light, floral flavor.Dark: Spaten Optimator: I usually do not like the darker beers. \u00a0Amber is as dark as I go. \u00a0But with the suggestion of the bartender, I tried this beer. \u00a0It had the full body taste like any other dark beer. \u00a0The difference with this beer is the sweet maple taste that went a long with it. \u00a0Surprisingly, \u00a0I enjoyed this beer! \u00a0The lesson I learned is don't knock it until you try it. \u00a0I road off all dark beers until I came across this one. \u00a0Hard Liquored Drinks:Drinks:Southern Belle: It came in a pint class with bits of strawberry and pineapple. \u00a0Refreshing sweetness with a hint of tartTuaca Berry Blast: Very sweet. \u00a0It was served in a pint class. \u00a0I was not a fan of this because I do not like my drinks very sweet. \u00a0I prefer a little tart flavor.-Their mixed drinks are not very strong. \u00a0I tasted more fruit then liquor. Martinis:To end the night, we had some martinis against my better judgment. Strawberry Field: \u00a0very sweet but not as sweet at the pomegranate press. \u00a0It tasted like medicine to me. \u00a0Pomegranate Press: A very sweet drink. \u00a0You can taste the alcohol in this drink. \u00a0I did not like it. \u00a0I felt like I was taking medicine. \u00a0-for my martini review: I don't like martinis but you might, so don't knock it until you try it! I hope this long review is helpful. \u00a0Please try all the many beers this place has to offer. \u00a0I can not stand seeing people order a Budlight when there are so many other beers Yardhouse has to offer. \u00a0I can't wait for my next visit !", "Date": "2011-04-29", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Jo V.", "ReviewID": "_-qXeEjsFuPlC1pks8u2aA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I said Beer Me...and they did! \u00a0That's all.", "Date": "2011-04-25", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Hannah L.", "ReviewID": "JIJRneoXt5fqPnwSCy_g6Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Extremely noisy, crowded, but excellent happy hour specials.

We ordered the boneless buffalo chicken with firecracker sauce, chicken nachos, calamari, and a peach martini. First off, the peach martini tasted like freakin' syrup! Couldn't taste no alcohol at all. Tasted as if the drink could be made for a child. The buffalo chicken was nothing much to rave about due to it's bland sauce and seasoning. The chicken nachos didn't taste as good as it sounded on the menu and the calamari was just your regular calamri. Out of all the items we ordered, I'd say the calamari was the best...which is real sad. On the account that majority of all calamaries at restaurants taste pretty ok.

I cannot lie I love it here. I am a huge fan of beer and the amount of beer on tap is just stunning.

It is a great beer haven and a great place for people who are just getting into beers sample some very fine beers from different parts of the country and... europe haha. The food is great and yes it is always packed, but I usually come here with just one or two other people, so it is never really that hard to find a seat at the bar. I love their jerk wings. They seemed grilled instead of fried with extra sauce, definitely a plus plus. Any of their stuff with ahi tuna in it is really creative and definitely killer. The one time I sat at one of the booth was a very good experience, despite what our waitress and the manager thought. Actually great experience. We were sat down pretty quickly and given menus, waters, utensils.. you know all natural restaurant stuff. I was there with my girlfriend and a good friend. We were talking, laughing, and deciding what \u00a0to eat. Out of nowhere, not our waitress, but another lady that looked professional came out and apologized to us. She was truly really sorry about the wait and seemed really concerned. We all looked at each other confused and then at her and said \"What wait?\". Seriously... we waited? it wasnt even that long. She said they are going to give us a complimentary dessert. SCORE!! If you follow my reviews, any place that gives me food that I do not have to pay for automatically gets 5 stars... haha JP... kinda playing.. haha maybe she heard about me. Anyways, food, beer.. all delicious and service was great the whole time. We picked the dessert sampler... duh of course! Of course we were going to get the most expensive thing on the dessert menu. It was delicious. Three different mousse/cheesecake deals... each one was better than the other.Great experience and I will definitely be back over and over again.

My best friend and I ordered the garlic noodles, since we both wanted to try something small and simple first. i grew tired of it after eating less than half of my plate.

A few other items on their menu caught my eye, but that day was just not my day, so i didnt bother ordering anything else. My best friend also ordered the mango mojito, and yum! it was good. one of the better mixed drinks i've had compared to other places.

Happy hour prices and menu were awesome. \u00a0I'm not one to complain over little things and I understand things happen but what went down is just not okay. When you pay money for something you expect great service to go along with it. In this case, it just didn't measure up to my standards.Service initially was great. The waitress was very friendly and attentive to our needs. I'm not even upset with the waitress, even though she made a big \"oops\". By \"oops\" i mean she dumped drinks on my coworker and I on accident. I was soaked, my entire right side, jacket and pants were wet and smelling of Vodka. Sitting through dinner with sticky, wet pants = not a good time. \u00a0She apologized and her manager came over to apologize, he asked if I wanted another drink. I had a full martini in front of me and planned on driving. I already smelled like a booze factory, another drink would not have been smart, \u00a0I \u00a0nicely declined his offer. I assumed they would take something off the bill, bring over a gift card or do something to show they were really sorry for the mess that took place. They brought us the bill and nothing had been done. To top it off they charged us $7.75 for martinis that should have been $6.We had to ask to speak to another manager. He then came out and he explained the fact they did nothing was unacceptable and he would like to take care of our dry cleaning. He wanted to take down our info. Are you kidding?!! Do you think I want to go bring my stuff to a dry cleaner when i can wash it myself then bring back a stupid dry cleaning tag to get reimbursed? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard and a HUGE inconvenience to me. It's our mistake for not bringing the bill to the waitresses attention and saying we should have been comped for something, but I'm not one to ask for things. I'm big on customer service and when drinks have been poured on someone they should be offered something to make up for it not have to go searching for a manager and ask to be comped. So end of story....had great expectations for this place, enjoyed the food. Left very disappointed in the management skills. They need some training.

Your food is not good and expensive, your beer is exorbitantly priced, your clientele is clueless and wasteful*, but hey, at least your waitstaff is polite!* I totally saw a girl order a half-yard of Guinness, take one sip, sign the check, and leave. What.The truffle fries were delicious, and the sweet potato fries were pretty good too. But here's the thing. All of the main dish food is so ugh, so \"I could have cooked this better at home\", so bleh. BJ's (and about a million other places) does it better, for cheaper, without all the trendy bullshit attitude of YH. Let me list my complaints more specifically.1) Beer selection is good - but the prices are outrageous. There's a reason they don't put a single price for any beer or any size on the menu. It's because they're going to rob you blind and never look back. My biggest gripe? The half-yard is 2 pints, right? I ordered a pint of Allagash White, one of my favorite beers. Turns out it was $6.50. But my boyfriend got a half-yard of the exact same beer - twice the amount - and it cost... $14. So...he could have bought two pints of it in regular pint glasses, saved himself the awkwardness of the stupidly shaped half-yard glass, and saved a dollar while he was at it. Huh????2) This place pretends to be a beer-lover's dream, when in actuality it caters to the general clueless beer-consuming public. Maybe it makes me a snob, okay, but come on...when the waitress calls SeaDog Blueberry Wheat \"like a blueberry Blue Moon\" and then when we go \"uhhh, what?\" she says \"well, it's just 'cause, like, Blue Moon is a wheat beer, and this is a blueberry wheat beer\". If you're serving 100 different beers you better know something more about beer than that! Come on! And then when we were trying to decide a beer for my boyfriend's mom, trying to get the waitress' help to choose a beer, and my boyfriend helpfully explains that she doesn't like hefs or white ales because of the strong \"spicy\" tastes like coriander and cloves -- the waitress goes \"woah, woah, okay...just trying to help...uh....why don't you just get uh....uh....\" And then just stares at us. Please. If you want 100 choices of beer and people who know what they're talking about, go to 99 Bottles in Santa Cruz. Or BevMo, for god's sake. 3) The food. Now, don't get me wrong, those truffle fries were damn good. But my grilled cheese --- something that's REALLY EASY to make -- was not so good. It was extremely greasy, like, dripping with oil. There's enough fat inside of it, you don't have to soak the bread in pure butter to throw it on the grill for 2 minutes. It was gross. And the tomatoes in it were sickly sweet like they'd been sitting in a container of sugar water all afternoon. The \"customer favorite\" tomato bisque the waitress highly recommended? Also overpoweringly sweet. And the kicker -- the grilled artichoke, something already overpriced and something anyone can do okay and only some places can do great -- was DISGUSTING. It tasted like lighter fluid, and I'm not just being over-the-top here. You could taste the lighter fluid they used to light their little grill to \"cook\" it. I put the quotation marks because that artichoke was not cooked. Not AT ALL. Way to take a $2 piece of produce, charge me $10 for it, douse it in chemicals, and not even make it edible. Where did this kitchen crew learn to cook??? Not even the heart of the artichoke was cooked. When the waitress asked me how I liked it, I tried a polite \"em......not really\" and she looked shocked. Shocked, I tell you. Yard House, let me just tell you, as a big artichoke fan, you're on my black list. I shudder at the memory of it.4) The price. Way overpriced. Not worth it. Bottom line here - a waste of your money. If you want beer and American food, go to......god, really, in the world where there's Yelp, you shouldn't even need to go somewhere like Yard House.

And proceeded to bend the I.D. and stare at it. It was extremely rude. My boyfriend never gets carded, ever so this was kind of surprising for us. My boyfriend doesn't look under 21 that's for sure. Anyways my BF was kind of pissed after that so luckily that guy wasn't our actual server. The beer took forever to come out and I got my House Hef way before my BF got his Black Velvet. Also my BF has been waiting to get the black & blue beer combo like he had at their Newport Beach \u00a0& Brea location but Santana Row doesn't have it on their menu! Nor did the guy know what we were talking about. We ordered some food - I got the pepper jack burger and my BF got the bbq bacon cheeseburger. It didn't take too long to come out and it was absolutely delicious. That pepper jack burger is so good - juicy and cheesy and the green chile is awesome on it. It's definitely my favorite hamburger now. The BBQ bacon one was super sweet - tasted like maple syrup. I didn't like it. My BF said it was good but he wouldn't get it again.Overall we had a good time - the beers are really good and the food is great and they have a ton of different options so we will be back.

I guess it was reasonable considering that there was a game that night and we had 8 people in our party. We were chillen most of the time at the bar ordering drinks and waiting to be seated. My favorite drink was the MALIBU PEACH =) The beers were cool too..Anyways, we were all so HUNGRY that we decided to order our food at the bar (since we looked around and saw that the people sitting at tables were waiting forever for their food). Good thing we did that because minutes after we got seated, our food arrived. We were all first timers and had no idea what to order.. so we kinda ordered a bit of everything from the appetizer menu. I especially enjoyed the lettuce wrap and the garlic noodles. Everything else was pretty decent too. My friend ordered the Spicy Jambalaya (an entree) which was pretty yummy too. Honestly, this place is really nice. I liked the atmosphere and the decor inside. It's very loud and lively. However, the wait is pretty ridiculous and really kills your mood when you're STARVING. And another reason why this place does not get 5 stars is because of an incident that happened when I was there. My friend walked to the bathroom by herself and the floor near the bathroom was wet. She slipped and (luckily) fell on her knees. There were about 2 employees standing RIGHT THERE and they just looked at her with blank stares and then went back to talking like nothing happened. They didn't even ask if she was okay or anything! HELLO?! LIABILITY?! Anyways, she later complained to the manager and told him that she was okay, but thought it was very rude that the employees did NOTHING when it happened. He apologized and later said that the employees DID reported it-- which is complete BS because they went back to talking to each other after she slipped. I think he said that only because he was afraid she would sue and that's understandable. The manager was nice to us, but the fact that their employees were idiots was the reason I held back on that last star. I just felt bad for my friend because she came out with her knees SOAKED like she fell into a puddle-- which was kinda what happened. This place is dark and it's dangerous that their staff didn't clean up the spill.. Maybe if they did their job instead of standing around chatting.. Hmm I don't know.. JUST SAYING.Other than that..

When we were ready for our check- we told him we;d be paying in 3 separate checks (told him which people would be paying together). For some reason that really baffled or irritated him - and he brought our check back and told us to divide it up and give him the dollar amounts we all wanted to pay. We were all sitting there trying to do the math on tax and tip because of course that wasn't on the check he gave us. Then some of the items were written weird so we had to try to decipher who ordered what. t was ridiculous - just separate the dang bill - I had never had a waiter tell me he couldn't do that before. So we finally get all the totals added up and written down (had to write on the back how much to charge each card) and our ORIGINAL server comes back to get our check. When we told him what we did he says (with a smile) \"Oh wow guys..that was a lot of work. You didn't have to do that- all you needed to do was let us know who was paying together\" I said \"Yeah that's what I thought too but that's not what the other guy said\".

Got seated right away and ordered our food and drinks at the same time cause we were starving.They have a large selection of food and an even longer selection of beers. It's pretty amazing but I'm not big on drinking, so I passed on any alcohol. I decided on truffle fries to start off, and like everyone says, they were pretty freaking fantastic. Nice and crispy with flavor in each fry. Yum! Our food came not too long after. I ordered the Penne with Chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was very creamy and the the portion was generous. My friend ordered a chicken and avocado sandwich and my other friend got the rib eye. I didn't get to try their food, but they said it was good.

Not Yard House's mistake or that there was a long line ahead of us but because of patrons who had finished their meal, cleared their check, and chose to still linger at the table socializing. This was frustrating because the earliest member of our group who got there had to wait way over an hour to sit down. The host said he tried to hover around the table but the group didn't take the hint - I thought that was rude especially when you know the place is popular and they need to be able to turn the table for the next group. Fellow Yard House lovers - please be courteous and don't linger at the table sooo long after being done...Luckily there are always places to stand around in the bar area - so we all got a glass of nice cold beer and chatted while waiting for our table (there was like 15 of us).

I highly commend the choice of location as well - conveniently at the end of Santana Row. This is a great restaurant with quality food for less than the average price at The Row. I am a fan of the truffle fries, lobster burger and kona coffee dessert. For about $2, you can upgrade a side of fries to truffle fries, which is what we did when we ordered the lobster burger. The fries are appealingly thin, fried to a crisp, heavy with truffle taste and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Coupled with a garlic aioli or just some plain ketchup is perfection. The lobster burger is a perfectly cooked patty (medium) with generous chunks of lobster meat from the tail and claws, topped with grilled asparagus on a soft brioche-like bun. This is also only about $15, which is worth it for this sublime dish. I've only ordered the kona coffee dessert once, but I remember a delicious concoction of kona coffee ice cream, fudge, cookie crumbs and a brittle of some sort. Simply divine. I also love the creme brulee sampler, specifically the banana creme brulee. I used to be a fan of the lobster garlic noodles when we first ordered them. However, it seems like they have changed the recipe of the dish. It has a substantially smaller portion of lobster, a sweeter soy-flavor that does not complement the dish well, and the noodles are somewhat soggy and sticky. This is too bad because I was more than happy to pay about $28 for this dish when it was more properly executed.

Yolanda was our bartender and she gave us a few samples of different beers to try. I personally like Blue Moon, so she ran with that and found me a beer that I absolutely loved.

I'm a pretty easy going diner, but when I recognize good service, I always try to give my praises. I will definitely return and hope that she is working when I do!As for the food, my friend and I came in for happy hour and tried the Kung Pao Calamari. I LOVE the candied walnuts!

We got to the place around 8 and we had to wait for an hour for a table, which was expected. The place was packed full of people! My first reaction was, \"I've never seen so many TV's in one restaurant before!\" (haha). The beer selection was insane. I've never seen so many different types of beers on tap. And the bar itself is oval-shaped so that was pretty cool. I ordered a Pear Cider to start off with (delish) and my bf got a Stella. I really enjoyed my cider; it was nice and crisp and not too bitter for my palette. After about waiting for an hour, my bf and I finally got seated. Our seating hostess was really nice! She asked me if I came there for the food or the beer and I said, \"Both!\". Our waiter was really nice and friendly! I forgot his name but he was a really nice waiter. About 15 minutes later, our waiter took our order. I had ordered a cup of the tomato bisque for my appetizer and ordered the Grilled Shrimp Caeser salad for my entree. The bf ordered clam chowder and a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Our soups came out the kitchen in a matter of minutes which was nice :). The tomato bisque was a little too salty for my taste, and not enough creaminess to it either. I was a little disappointed. I tasted the clam chowder that my bf had ordered and to me, it had no flavor whatsoever. I was surprised... Maybe my expectations were a little too high?? IDK. So after 10-15 minutes after eating our soups, our entrees came to our table. When our waiter presented my salad to me, my first thought was, \"Wow... my salad looks so plain.\" I remembered reading the description on the menu that the salad would come with toppings and whatnot. But my salad didn't. All it had was the lettuce, the shrimp, and the dressing. My bf's pizza looked normal. So I wasn't too jazzed about my salad... I didn't even finish eating it. I definitely have to come back and try out their other menu options and drink options as well...

The food is pretty much the same quality as what you will find at Cheescake factory, Elephant Bar, etc..(And similar prices). My biggest beef with this place is the service, and lack thereof. When we were to be seated, a few of my friends were late, and the hostess did not want to delay our seating for about 15 minutes, and began putting pressure on us to sit, or we would loose our spot (We had already waited over an hour for a table). We then sat, and the main waitress was very nice,but very overwhelmed, and it took soooo long to get everything, we ordered drinks, it took 15 minutes to get drinks, we got our food, it was like 20 minutes (Acceptable), but we finished our drinks in 5 minutes, and it was like 20 minutes before we were asked for refills, ordered more, then it took another 15 minutes to get them, and we had them finished in about 5-10, so we basically would have ordered at least another 15-20 drinks (we were there for 3 hours) had they been briging them out in a timely fashion..Note to managment: You don't have enough people working to serve people in a timely manner, stop being cheapskates and bring in some help for your people!! Your actions are affecting the tips for your servers and bartenders. Your corporate playbook cannot make these decisions for you, get your heads out your asses and run the place like it should. It's very evident that the managment of this place has no idea on how to staff a place like this..I will not be going back, mainly because of the service, the managment of this place has to understand that once the allure of being in Santana Row and being a new place wears off, the only thing that they will be left with is there food (which is run of the mill corporate chain food), and their service (which is terrible at this point).

Yard House lost our reservations for a party of 10, and manager/hostess were quite rude about the whole thing. \"People lie about having reservations all the time,\" how sweet of them. After several of our party complained, we were given two bar tables and promised free appetizers. Needless to say, free appetizers did not happen.Food: okay, whatever. It's a chain restaurant, so prices are in the $18-30 dollar range and most Happy Hour food is fried/greasy/not real food. Calamari was limp and cold. Decent portions I guess.Drinks: Stick to beer/wine. Yucky Martinis that tasted like cough syrup. Service: Just let me rant a little on this one. I have a medical condition that causes me to lose consciousness at really inopportune times. Like in a hellish setting such as Yard House. Usually I'm fine within 10 minutes if I can just sit down, put my head down, sip on water, maybe have some bread. We were all standing up to leave and I felt it happening and I sat back down with my head in my arms while I tried to stay conscious. Apparently the manager had an issue with my putting my head down on the table so I propped it up. But then another guy came by and told my friends my eyes also had to be open. Don't know if you've ever fainted \u00a0before, but it's pretty hard to keep your eyes open when that happens. My friends explained that I have a medical condition, but I was asked to leave though I couldn't really stand up without my vision going black. So my friends basically walked me out as I couldn't see or hear anything.

Whoever she was, got us a table in less than 10 minutes as opposed to 1 hour like the rest of the patrons.We were greeting by our server: Natalie. Oh Natalie. She took our drink order and checked everyones ID. We ordered our food and some of us ordered starters. Natalie even asked me if we wanted some of these things as our meal or as starters and I replied yes and she said \"ok something to snack on first.\" With that said.. did we ever get it? No! Our food started to come in, but it tapered onto our table. About halfway through the meals of those who received it, I asked where my meal was along with 2 other people AND our starters. She said \"oh those didn't come out yet?\" Obviously NOT otherwise I would be eating. So 5 minutes later ( I think she didn't place the order or forgot) outcome our burgers. Because MY order truffle fries hadn't arrived, I told her to cancel my order. A few minutes later, my friend called her over to ask where her order of truffle fries. Natalie looked at me and said \"I thought you cancelled the truffle fries?\" I told her I cancelled only MY order and not anyone else. Oh she also brought my other friend a carne asada taco when she ordered a pork belly taco and after my friend looked at it and told her that this is not pork belly she argued that it was pork belly. My friend pointed at another plate on the table and asked then whats that (knowing she was pointing at a pork belly taco) Natalie said its pork belly. So my friend asked, \"then why does mine look different?!\" So then Natalie told her because she ordered a different kind of pork belly taco.. well my friend knew there was only one kind of pork belly on the menu, but again, Natalie argued and thought she was right. She brought over a menu and to her dismay, she was MODED. Get your facts straight girl. So she FINALLY took the carne asada taco back and brought her a correct order. To sum it up, our bill still had BOTH orders of truffle fries when in fact there should've only been 1 order. I called her over and complained and told her to take it off of the menu then she said \"but she still wanted her truffle fries.\" So I said \"initially I ordered truffle fries. Either you forgot them, or the order was never placed so I talk to you to cancel them. So why is it still on the bill?! And again, blamed \"somebody else\" by saying \"I don't know why they keep doing that?!\" Man, if shes our server shouldn't she been handling the orders/bill?! And who is \"THEY\"?

There appeared to be a large crowd of folks looking to meet someone (yay meat market). Food: My husband had the crab cake hoagie and I had the turkey club. My club had too much mayo and was packed so full it was difficult to eat, but the ingredients were fresh and delicious. My husband really enjoyed his crab cake hoagie. He also had the tomato bisque which he described as super delicious. I had a cup of french onion soup which was good, but by no means the best I've ever had. Before hand we had the \"california roll\" appetizer which the waitress asked if we would like to have chopsticks for. Of course we said yes, until it arrived and we were completely perplexed at how anyone was expected to eat what looked like 6\" wide, 2\" high cake of rice with chopsticks. The sauce was flavorful, but the appetizer was generally more confusing the delicious. My husband ordered one of the 133 beers on tap (seriously....133 - very impressive) while I ordered a Southern Belle (sweet tea vodka, strawberry, and pineapple) which was one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Ambiance - Loud, but with surprisingly good acoustics. The place felt loud, but I did not have to raise my voice to be heard and didn't have to ask my husband or brother-in-law to repeat themselves. The place has dimmed lights and high backed seats in the booths so there is an opportunity for some intimacy, but the large open bar area and sports games on the TVs makes it casual enough to make it relaxing and a great place to hang out with friends. Service - Our waitress was super friendly and mostly attentive. We had to wait a little while for drink re-fills, but overall she was great. Drink orders took forever - but the place is brand new (four weeks open) and packed even on a Wednesday night so I'll cut them a bit of slack on that point. I'm sure that will improve as the newness of the place wears off a little. Price - A little bit overpriced. The food is very good, and the prices are comparable to other high-end (but not fine dining) restaurants, but I still felt they were a little on the pricey end - then again, it is Santana Row so not really so overpriced for the area.", "Date": "2011-05-12", "Author_Location": "El Cerrito, CA"}, {"Author": "Claudia H.", "ReviewID": "PhWV62-U1XX8PXkS9wJb-Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This place seems to be packed at all times! so when my fiance and I passed by mis day we decided to give a shot.

You're complaining about the wait time??A. You've obviously read others reviews, why do you think you're special? (As in, others have waited forever, you will, too.) B. It's Santana Row, you almost have to wait thirty minutes for a sandwich at Pluto's. C. This is a new restaurant offering a lot more than most others in our area (aka tonssssssssssss of beers on tap (hallelujah), absolutely delicious food and fairly good hours).= Don't complain about your wait time, that's your own fault. They don't deserve a star off because of wait time. On to my personal experience -Unfortunately YH doesn't note when the kitchen closes/the fact that the kitchen closes before they \"close\". To me, when you close at midnight, that means you are open that full time. I've worked in a restaurant and that was our policy - after the restaurant shuts down/past \"closing hours\", you do the cleaning/closing duties. I've also eaten in numerous establishments that have closed and still allowed us, because we were already seated, to order dessert after closing. So, thinking they close at 12 and not knowing any better, SO and I arrived at 10:50ish (not our usual dinner hour, but he was finishing a paper for finals). The hostess told us the crushing news - last call for food = 11:00 and drinks = 11:20. Our goal was food, and we were desperate. There were no clean tables, and I think she sensed our deep desire to munch, so she went to rush the bussers to get us a table. Score one.We were seated and she said she'd rush our server over to try and get a food order in. Server shows up at 11 on the dot and tells us she can't submit food any longer. I was going to go along with it and just find a drive-thru, but SO fought it/asked that she at least try and sure enough - success! Score two.With our food order in, I ordered the Tinnerman Strawberry beer, and thennnnnnnnn I died and went to heaven. Score three.Food arrived pretty quickly and we were very impressed with the portions and flavors. Unfortunately, it wasn't hot like fiyah, but still delicious. We ordered from the happy hour menu - calamari, onion ring tower, and the bearnaise sliders (with normal, to-die-for skinny fries). Seemed like a feast, and I still brought half the onion rings and one slider home. Definitely enough food for us, and definitely enough for us to come back. We even talked about making it a weekly meal - that should tell you a lot. Score four. The icing on the cake - our bill was $23 and some change. We basically spent that same amount two nights before at In N Out. I'm still in shock and awe with that price tag. Ah-may-zing. We will be back.Oh, and our awesome server - Elizabeth! Thanks for the last minute dinner!!! Although we're debating what the hearts on our receipt meant....?

We got the pepper fillet, which was way too tough and overcooked. Someone else got the halibut and that was also overcooked. I got the surf and turf burger and this was the first time I ever ate a burger that had a soggy bun. We also got the truffle fries, calamari, and the firecracker wings. The fries and firecracker wings were good. The beers are about $7.50-$8.50 for a 12 ounce goblet.

Make sure you come early!-What I like is that if you're trying to enjoy happy hour, and there are no table, you can just go to the bar and order. You can enjoy your cheaper beer while waiting for your table. The bartenders are very friendly and helpful when it comes to the beers-The waiting area is small-- and I mean small. Actually, there may not even be an actually waiting area. It seems like you're a fire hazard when you're standing on top of the stairs waiting for a table. Waiting in the front is a little uncomfortable since the sun shines DIRECTLY on that side. So you have to go around the corner to find some shade and a little fountain to sit on.-Very organized for having so many beers. If you're lucky, you'll get a very knowledgeable server.TRUFFLE FRIES! They are amazing. A MUST GET at Yard House.APPETIZERS!! These are the ones on the happy hour menuPIZZAS! Perfect for two people, or one if you're super hungry. Got the pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and the pineapple one. GOod stuff! Thin crust. Get a side of ranch or bleu cheeseGARLIC NOODLES: Good, but needs a tad more garlic. and maybe some veggies mixed inNACHOS: super big portion for such a great price. oddly enough we ran out of chips and had a lot of excess guac, cheese and whatnot...LETTUCE WRAPS: I love them! Don't forget to try ALL the sauces it comes with. I always have more meat than lettuce and ask for more.CHICKEN STRIPS: fresh and freaken delicious.SLIDERS: Bernaise Sliders. Not sure what 'bernaise' is (I think it's butter or something), but the sauce is amazing. The sliders come with fries too!CALAMARI: Not the best. Not much flavor. I wouldn't get it again.BEER...THE MAIN REASON WHY THIS PALCE IS ALWAYS BUSYI've had a couple of the beers, and I've made it one of my life long goals to try every single beer there. So, here are the ones I've had:SNAKE BITE: It's like a pear cider with some other beer. It's really good! More on the sweet side, but not too sweet. Good to have on a hot day, or when you don't want that super 'beer' tasteHOGAARDEN: I love this beer! it's like a lighter blue moon. mmmmmmazingHOUSE AMBER: For being just the house amber, this one is really good. It's a red ale. Remember, if you're drinking a red ale, take a sip, wait a minute or two, then take a sip again. Then you'll be able to taste the actual flavors. Or else your first sip will be super bitter.ROSE GAARDEN: it's a mix of hogaarden and a lambic (super sweet beer). I thought it would taste better, but it was super sweet. Like too sweet. All in all, Yard House is a great place to go and hang out with friends. i would definitely suggest going during happy hour since the prices are steals. Haven't gone during non-happy hour yet.

The waitress did help us by telling us what drinks they didn't have. She took our order and left. 5 mins later, the waitress comes back and tells us that one of our drink orders were out of stock. So, she takes another drink order for my friend. A few minutes later, the manager comes out and rudely says to my friend, \"we can't place the order for you drink because it's after the cut off.\" then rudely walks away. No apologies. We ordered in before the cut off time and because they do not have it in stock should not be our fault. Yardhouse has a very nice environment and is hip but the staff needs to have better communication with the bar to inform patrons that something is out of stock.

The beer selection is amazing, if you like that sort of thing, and you can get it in those fancy yard glasses that make you feel like a rock star/alcoholic whilst drinking from them. Every time I've gone the place has been insanely packed - to the point where my borderline agoraphobic self has trouble maintaining inside. This time, since we were going to eat, we checked in at the front and then made a pass around the huge bar section hoping to find a place to land and get a drink while we waited. Easier said than done, as we had to dodge and weave among the sea of sharp dressed brokers and bandana-under-hat, foil-tee wearing customers just to get within ten feet of the bar. I saw an open table near the bar, and, not knowing if that area was open seating or still under the jurisdiction of the seated dining, I asked a waitress nearby if that was part of the bar. She just looked at me like I was the biggest asshole ever and said \"No. The bar is the bar.\" Ohhhhh...the baaaar is the bar! It's all clear now. I would have left based on that experience alone, but there aren't a whole lot of dining options at 9:30PM on a weeknight, so we just went somewhere else for a drink before the pager went off to be seated.I'm so glad we waited, because the turkey burger I ended up getting (and horribly cheating on my resolution to replace dinner with healthy vegetable/fruit juices) was SCRUMPTIOUS. Best burger I've ever had, and I've eaten a lot of burgers. Of course, that could have been because I was already two cocktails in on an empty stomach, but I have a feeling that it would have been just as good sober.

Although the waitress kept encouraging to get bigger size drinks, which we kind of got upset about because we felt she was forcing to buy something we didn't want.Anyway, my friend also got the salsa and chip plate, which was actually pretty big and it could feed about 4 people and it was half off too!

There's a long line to get in every weekend, and it's still crowded on the weekdays, so I expected it to be really good with it's 100+ beers on tap, like the worldwide selection at Father's Office in Santa Monica.But it turns out the beers they have on tap are really nothing special. They have a few varieties I haven't tried before, but you can buy most of the selection in grocery stores, as where Father's Office has beers I've never heard of. The place was more of a restaurant than it is a bar, kinda like Elephant Bar or BJ's type, but the food here has been really good so far.I guess an extra attraction for this place are the ridiculously huge glasses they have for beers, a tall glass which is kinda reminiscent of the drinks they have in Vegas. But even though the selection isn't the most exotic, with so many beers on tap, why would you want that much of one specific beer?We had a half hour wait, but that wasn't a problem with their 100+ beers on tap... that really just gave us a chance to get to know the menu and more importantly, their selection of beers, and get started on a few rounds before sitting down to order some food.The waitress suggested the Grilled Artichoke and Chips dish, and while it was good and enjoyable, it wasn't great. I would have liked it better if the artichoke was in the dip, instead of leaving it on the plate for us to peel apart ourselves.The burgers are pretty good, although it really does take a lot of work to screw up a burger, but he fries were the best thing on the plate. Cut thin so they're extra crispy and very tasty, this was one thing we cleaned off our plates.The (Mac and Cheese) was very good, although there isn't too much about it that made it special. The proportion was huge, but it left me feeling like something was missing from the dish. Perhaps putting the chicken on the side instead of adding strips of chicken in the Mac and Cheese would have made it feel more like a meal rather than an appetizer.Now that I've been there, I can feel a bit more at ease about not going again for a bit, but their Sliders, Truffle Fries, and Onion Ring Tower sound like a great companion to the 100+ beers they have on tap, and even though I was a bit disappointed at their beer selection, it isn't horrible and I have an urge to go again next week just for that.

We went early (around 5pm) to catch happy hour. I definitely recommend going early if you don't want to take on the crazy wait that seemed to be starting around 7. I was pleasantly surprised that Happy hour is offered to the entire restaurant and not just applicable in certain areas (i.e. only at the bar). Happy hour offerings include half priced sliders, pizzas and random selections from the main app menu along with discount drinks. The Spicy Tuna Roll is served uniquely as a layered dish of edamame beans, cucumber, onion, spicy tuna and avocado with shredded seaweed mixed in. Delicious! The pizza was good and the Moo Shu Chicken Egg Rolls were a nice surprise of crispy, yummy goodness. The mac & cheese had nice chunks of bacon, chicken and wild mushrooms in it but the chicken was a bit chewy and I felt like the dish was more cream than cheese heavy. At the end of the meal they brought out a yummy mini lemon souffl\u00e9 with a candle for my birthday. Sweet. The beer, the beer! \u00a0We started off with the Belgian Six Pack (6 beers, 3 oz of each), a good way to try a lot of beers without ordering a full glass. They have one other set tasting they call \"Traditional\" which is 6 beers, 5oz each. Unfortunately you can't make your own tasting but the good news is each person can get two free tastes (about 1oz). \u00a0With over 100 beers on tap and decent happy hour pricing, the Yard House is definitely a place I will return to. With that said, a little extra attention would get them the five star mark. Service was quick and friendly but I was surprised that the staff didn't seem very well educated on the beers and how to recommend the best option based on their patron's tastes. While they definitely showed love of beer I would expect better training for a place whose \"big thing\" is beer. While the Spicy Tuna Roll was delicious we found a full edamame bean and an avocado stem in it which made it less appealing. That said, will I go back?

The service was good esp seeing as we were such a large group but my biggest complaint about this place and the real reason it is getting 2 stars is because of the fact that they kick you out of the place when they are closing.

This was a friday night and they closed at 12am and the entire place was literally empty by 12:10. Some people were still eating and drinking but that didnt matter. what horrible customer service that is. I almost cannot believe a restauraunt is even allowed to do that.

The common situation arose where a person was trying to use an expired ID to purchase alcohol in a place where their main source revenue is through alcohol and without it, they lose business. But even more importantly, people lose jobs. Working in customer service myself, I feel like society in general is getting stupider and stupider. I was thinking to myself that this person shouldn't make a big deal if he gets denied since normal people would understand that an expired license is no longer valid. The bartender explains to the couple that he'd have to speak with his manager to try and get it approved and that it would only take a second. Seconds later, a manager comes by and explains that it would be a risk of losing the restaurant's liquor license and that they could not accept the ID. To myself, I thought that was a good enough explanation. I'd understand that my ID is invalid and that I wouldn't even put forth energy in trying to argue my case to every drink I order. However, to the gentleman beside me, he felt as though he should stand up for his date so that he could get her drunk in hopes of getting laid. His case continues and suddenly he feels that he has the right to tell the manager how to do her job. He explains how they've purchased items in the past with two credit cards (Someone should let him know that credit cards don't contain birth dates.) and that the manager should look through their records to find that specific one, which in essence would validate his date's expired license. Personally, I'd feel a bit insecure if restaurants had my credit card information that readily available. I know, at least where I work, it's even illegal to keep a customer's e-mail on file. Anyway, to make a long story short, the customer was still bitter. And, to my surprise, was still unsatisfied.

Our server was nice and attentive. \u00a0I ordered a framboise beer and it was soooo good! \u00a0I don't drink too much beer but this was so light and fruity it didn't really taste like beer at all. \u00a0For an appetizer we got the crab artichoke dip (something like that) and it was really tasty. \u00a0I got the spicy jamabalya and my bf got the penne pasta. \u00a0My dish was really good just a touch on the salty side and my bf's dish was really good he said. \u00a0The atmosphere was really nice and they have a lot of tv's there so you're sure not to miss the game no matter where you sit. \u00a0Overall we liked it and would go back again. \u00a0I took off one star due to the saltiness of my dish and because when we were ordering, we had been asked if we wanted the small portion or the large portion....well, we had never been there before (and we had told her this already) and asked how big is the small portion? \u00a0Her answer was \"about a little over half of the large portion\" \u00a0this answer would have been fine and dandy if we had been there before and had an idea of how big their large is...anyway I would recommend trying it out but from what I hear, not on the weekends because it gets really busy and the wait is insane", "Date": "2012-08-30", "Author_Location": "Campbell, CA"}, {"Author": "Laura C.", "ReviewID": "9MiRdBEtL5FMMBb-KM_c5g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first time I ate at the Yard House was recently in Honolulu, Waikiki, and in a very expensive resort area for dining out, it was WONDERFUL to find that the Yard House had the most yummy tacos for less than $5 each! They were fabulous, each one was an amazing blend of flavors! When we came back to San Jose, we found that there was a Yard House right here in our neighborhood, and they serve the very same yummy tacos! What a great discovery, and they don't advertise these inexpensive taste treats much, but they need to, cause they are FABULOUS, especially the blackened swordfish and the Korean short rib tacos, so delightful! This place is really great, it looks fun and full of atmosphere from the moment you walk in and the service was really great! I am so glad there is a Yard House so close to our home, we will be back again and again! And if you are ever in Waikiki, you have to check them out there, too, great food for sure!", "Date": "2012-07-22", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "crystal p.", "ReviewID": "dYNV6yc4nYW0_Wqt7nMIHQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i love this place but the last time i was here with a few girlfriends for happy hour 10-12 our freaking waitress was so RUDE! we got here about 9 about 930 we were seated for a party of 10 and told our waitress that we were waiting for a few friends to get here before we decided to order drinks and what not. 950 rolled around and the girls were not here yet so we told the waitress were still waiting and besides happy hour doesnt start until 10 anyways!!! she comes back later and was \"well are u guys ready to order yet.. its been 45 mins\" in such a rude tone and rolling her eyes that i wanted to leap across the table and slap her face!!! \u00a0how many times did she wanted us to repeat to her that we were waiting for our friends to come????????? after we got all bitchy back to her that she wanted to act \"nice\" i think its lame that youre not allowed to order a martini and a beer at the same time. no per guest at a time. the food here is good but the service needs help. we told her to do separate tabs for everyone but once we got the bill it was all together so annoying. so how we end up giving her 20% tip which she doesnt deserves it all!", "Date": "2011-06-04", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "mo s.", "ReviewID": "kGW5vwdQxNmUAuNmHpJwdA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i was going to give it four stars, beacuse it's always busy, you have to park in the structures that are quite a walk away and the location. but then i realized i was being too picky and the only reason its so packed always is because its awesome! they have chocolate beer that taste like dark bitter sweet chocolate thats melted down. sooooo wonderful. the food was only decent, but their beer and drink selection is insane,", "Date": "2011-07-20", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "M M.", "ReviewID": "PPcAf_a1zFl2hDoitcrYlA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this will be the first and last time i'll eat at this place. came here with a group of 10 people \u00a0on 1/28/12 and got in at 930 pm and the manager said it will take 45-1 hr wait which is understandable. here comes 1045 still waiting.

The wait was super long and waited longer than we were told!!! We weren't given water even ordering cocktails. The drink we got was recommended by the server, Juniper Passion or something like that, it was so nasty! I couldn't even drink it I had to order another drink just to get the taste out of my mouth. Then we got our food. I was excited about the food b/c I've heard ppl rave about their food. I got the porcini crusted halibut. \u00a0It look so delicious, the sauce was great, vegetables were a little over cooked, which I ignored. BUT my halibut was EXTREMELY over cooked and some of the crust was a little burnt. \u00a0It was so dry that I tried dipping every bite with the sauce and it still didn't help!!! So dry that I almost choked trying to swallow it! Not having any water on the side, I had to chug my cosmo to get the food to go down!!! When the server came over to ask how things were, I told her about my fish and nothing was done!!! No apology, I didn't get a new one! It was a waste of food and money! Ahi poke bowl, was ok. The sauce was very watery and no flavor. Only thing they for right was my cosmo!!!
