I've eaten 2 Egg McMuffins my entire life. Last night I was introduced to the scintillating combinations of fried chicken, waffles, and breakfast food that Roscoe's offers. I was put on a wait list with a party of 6 and got in immediately at 12 am on a Saturday night. I was pleasantly surprised.....the chicken is tender and the quality is better than I expected. They even made the omelette I ordered with only egg whites!!! \u00a0 4 out of 6 waffles were soft in the center. The cornbread was dried up. The service sucked hard. The security guard was rude. The wait for the food was way too long. I was impressed by the funky 70's vibes, but they didn't have a decent soundtrack going off. The LAX location is bigger, cleaner, and apparently the staff is way nicer.

The service was bad. My server was pretty awful. It took her more then 10 minutes to even greet our table. She forgot to bring my waffles, which is an honest mistake. But she never apologized. And we had to chase her down to get our drinks refilled and for to go containers because she was standing there chatting with fellow servers. Probably the worst server in LA.

You don't mix them or anything, but they are separate entities that are just on one plate. Interesting, I guess it is the whole sweet and salty alternating tastes that makes it feasible.

We arrived here at around 2PM and to my surprise, there wasn't that much of a wait. We drove by the location at first in hopes of a parking lot but there was none, all parking was with the meters -- which were PACKED! We drove around for a bit and finally found free parking just a crosswalk away from Roscoe's, thank goodness! We were seated as soon as we arrived and our waiter was really friendly and attentive. It was pretty busy inside but nothing too crazy. My boyfriend and I both got the #1 on the menu (two pieces of chicken & two waffles) with side orders of gravy and corn bread (I'm a sucker for good corn bread). Our total turned out to be ~$32.00. The wait for our food wasn't too long which I really appreciated.FOOD:- The chicken was well seasoned & crispy although I had expected more of a crunch from the waffles since they turned out to be quite soft and meh. - Three scoops of butter and two syrup cups per plate -- wowza! I scooped off a lot of the butter and barely got half-way through one of the syrup cups. - The gravy was something else! And I mean that in a good way. It was a lot different than the gravy that I'm used to... so flavorful and wonderfully seasoned. - The corn bread was big! The edges were ever so crispy while the bread so crumbly and delicious. Both my boyfriend and I could barely finish one helping of it because we were so stuffed from our chicken & waffles. SERVICE:- Our waiter came by about 3-4 times throughout our meal to check up on us, asked us how our meal was and to refill our water which I really appreciated given that there was a crowd coming in for the lunch hour. I enjoyed my trip here and had a good time although it didn't live up to what many had hyped it up to be for me.

I usually get the Obama Special (3 wings and a waffle) or just order #18 (a leg or thigh and waffle) and then add another waffle to it. Carol C. Special is popular among my friends, but I prefer dark meat. The chicken is perfection. It's hot with a profound crisp on the outside that doesn't get soggy or hard, and inside the meat is moist and juicy.

I couldn't believe that my mac n cheese and greens were $5 sides and in such small dishes, though! I got sweet tea and it was definitely sweet and I ended up adding water to mine (probably sacrilegious) to dilute it. The salad wasn't bad, fries were fresh and homemade, and mac n cheese was nice and flavorful. The greens were too bitter and salty unfortunately for my taste. Highlights are their candied yams (sweet but delicious), waffles (so fluffy and light yet crispy), and corn bread (light and flavorful). I can't say I'd go back, but I was happy to go and make family happy! If I did, I'd probably just order a waffle!!! Overpriced for basic food, though I could never complain over a lack of flavor!

The place seemed small, but afterwards I realized that there are two separate rooms. Bare bones kind of place, which is fine. I wasn't expecting much. Our waitress finally comes over. No greeting. Just a, \"you guys ready?\" Why yes, yes we are. Because we've been sitting here for 15 minutes so we've had plenty of time to figure out everything. She's in a rush. I get it.

Food takes a decent amount of time, but the chicken was piping hot, so I'm not complaining. Unfortunately, the waitress comes over and throws down our plates and performs an immediate about face and dashes without even asking us if we have everything. I look down at the table. Look up at my boyfriend. Look down at the table and say, \"Damn. Where's my Mac and Cheese?\" I REALLY wanted Mac and Cheese...it's actually the whole reason I was looking forward to going. At first I thought to myself, well maybe she'll bring it out later. WRONG. As a matter of fact, we never saw her again until she brought us the bill (didn't ask us if we wanted anything else, just dropped the bill off) so I didn't even have the chance to ask her about it. And when she did bring us the bill, I tried to stop her before she dashed off again to ask if we would be charged for the Mac and Cheese, but..alas..she ignored me and sprinted away while all I could get out was, \"umm -excus....\" Luckily, we weren't billed for it, so whatever.I've never felt so dismissed by a waitress ever. In any case, the food here is good. Fried chicken was delicious and the waffle was great. A great late night grub fest. Sorry the waitress ruined it.

You don't come here for the outstanding service right?So tonight we tried the #2 Scoe's which is 1/4 chicken white, gravy, waffles and added the Mac and cheese. Do Not Get The Gravy on the chicken! It was like slop and while I still ate it all it completely ruined any flavor in the batter of the \"famous\" chicken. Maybe order on the side if you NEED gravy in your life, but don't waste your time. That was the first and last time I ask for gravy on anything. (Learned my lesson)Waffles were a tad soggy, I don't care though since drenched in syrup and butter it just tasted like amazing-ness to me but my friend didn't finish his because of it...The Mac and cheese is $5.40 and the portion fits in your hand... So I felt a tad ripped off and it wasn't mind blowing. It tasted \"homemade\" but lacking something still.I mean we live in a culinary bomb shell with places like Steampunk and another place I have brunch at on Santa Monica (always forget the name) making REAL chicken and waffles with chef flair and textures, why are we still rating places like this 4 or 5 stars? This will be the last time I come here for awhile, I love the place but my palette has expanded to something better, a better, fresher take on a classic dish.So in turn, it's good still.

My friend offered to drive me to this quintessential establishment, and I'd heard folklore of someone named \u00a0\"Big Mama\" coming around and slapping your arms if you ate with your elbows on the table. It scared me and I didn't want to go alone.I guess I ordered too much. I ordered the standard chicken and waffles, chicken livers, and mac & cheese. Mac & cheese wasn't dry and tasted okay, but I could probably skip it at $5 for a small bowl. I love me some mac & cheese and I love burning cash, but sometimes the two don't pair up.Chicken liver were breaded and fried, and they gave us a full plate of it. I'd rather have had a Pho Bowl full of Mac & Cheese, but it was perfect for my anemic friend. He needs the iron or to have two pairs of socks on.Now for the glorious CHICKEN AND WAFFLES...yeah. It's copious amounts of hype. I'll give it to you; It's good. The chicken was lightly breaded, piping hot, juicy, and perfectly cooked. The waffles on the other hand were soggy like everyone else is whining about. I want it crunchy. Still, somehow like a comedy of errors, these two bed-mates make for a very satisfactory meal. It's sweet. It's salty. It's hot then it's cold. It's yes then it's no. It's in then it's out. ...YOU DON'T REALLY WANNA STAY, NO! Jesus.Back to the hype. It's like hipster prices for chicken and waffles. It's like if you went to the SGV for some good fried rice, but then found out that now there's a long ass line, the serving is half the size, they have menus with color photos and English words on it, and what use to cost $5 is now $12.85!

The waffles are thinner, and remind me of Eggo waffles but more focused production when it comes to quality and overall taste. \u00a0They are seriously excellent. \u00a0The chicken tastes just like what your mom probably made growing up, amazinly well made fried chicken and it compliments the waffles PERFECTLY. \u00a0 Finally, the service is impeccable. \u00a0This is why I couldn't give it less than 5 stars. \u00a0The food, price, and portions are all great, and to top it off, the service is attentive, friendly, and fast. \u00a0None of the servers or staff I've ever dealt with were ever not smiling, helpful, or unhappy to assist you. \u00a0The food service comes quick, drink refills are quicker, and the staff is attentive to checking a few times. \u00a0I think it helps the area is much smaller than your standard restaurant, which is nice anyways so that you are surely getting any help whenever you can. \u00a0Cannot say enough good things about this place. \u00a0If you are visiting LA it's a must have and staple that you need to have at least once, regardless of whatever predetermined notions you have about the food combination.

You really can't screw up deep fried livers. I wish there was a sauce that I could dip the livers in. Luckily my gravy from the chicken was the saving grace.For my entree, I had ordered Scoes's #1. Chicken and waffles; it is such a bizarre combination. I really enjoy both foods independently, but together they are a non-sequitur.

And do not forget the sweet tea! It may be growing on me, but only within the sanctuary of a southern restaurant. If I must have it, then I will only have it done right. The waffle was so sweet and so thick, warm and steaming right from the griddle. I almost wanted to go out on the veranda, sip my sweet tea and watch the sunrise over the swamps. It felt so old-style southern, to munch on it, lightly drizzled in a little maple syrup and a dollop of churned butter. It probably also helped that I was wearing a long, cotton dress, only enhancing that southern charm that surrounded the meal. The fried chicken was done so well, moist, succulent, sweet just like the waffle. I am convinced that the batter they use for the waffle is also used for the chicken, or at least some of it, because the flavors meld so well together that it makes a person, me in this case, sigh with desire, with contentment, like a good morning kiss from the love of your life. I ate the chicken piece by piece, with my hands, never with a fork, only making sure I touch the greasy, crispy brown fried goodness. The collard greens were better this time around. They weren't drenched in oil, in vinegar, as one can see. They were piled high and so delicious. Warm and with a slight bit of crunch still within them, I still used my fingers to eat them. This, perhaps, was outside the southern charm, the southern manners that this place may benefit from, but I didn't care. There was no reason to scorn me for enjoying this soul food, just me and the food, nothing else. Roscoe's wins hands down, because the sweetness and the golden crisp of the fried chicken blew me away.

The lucrative prices were present, but the food taste and portion size was definitely worth the price. The order of chicken was so big it required its own plate.

I only managed to eat all of the chicken, and a waffle, with one waffle left. Simply put, this place's food rocks! The only negative I have is that some chicken portions are just riddled with bones, which I feel should not be on the platter. Also, the Sprite that time was really old tasting, and by that I mean the carbonated drink had gone flat.

You have got to be drunk to enjoy this food. \u00a0If this is LA standards for a 4 star restaurant, I'm not sure I want to eat in LA. I came here with my boyfriend and dragged his family along because it seemed like one of most popular eateries in LA based on Yelp reviews and word of mouth. My boyfriend and I got Scoes No. 1 with 1/4 a chick and 2 waffles. We also got a side of Mac and Cheese. I got dark meat and my boyfriend got white meat. This meal was expensive for fried chicken and waffles. We payed a whopping 11 dollars per plate and an extra 5 bucks for a tiny bowl of Mac and Cheese. The chicken was bland. The skin tasted like oil. I thought maybe it would have a CAJUN spice kick. This place is supposed to serve soul food I thought, but the chicken was tasteless. My dark meat was tender, but my boyfriends meat was tough. Any of the fried chicken chains has better tasting chicken, particularly popyes and it's a lot cheaper too. I've had fried chicken in gas stations in Louisiana, and the chicken tastes a lot better. Soul food should have a cajun spice kick, and roscoe's chicken does not!The waffles were supbar. They were SOGGY. Waffles should be CRISPY. Lego Ego waffles from a box fixed in a toaster taste better. We got mac and cheese because according to yelp reviews it's the best. The mac and cheese was also pretty tasteless, chunky, and seemed to mostly consist of butter. The pasta texture wasn't that great either. I think Mac and Cheese from a box tastes a lot better. Our server was friendly, but not super attentive and the restaurant wasn't that busy at 3 pm. It took her a while to get our bill. The restaurant doesn't have it's own lot and you have to pay for street parking. The surrounding area of the restaurant is a bit sketchy and so is the crowd for being near Hollywood, but maybe most of LA is. Overall, I was embarrased to drag my boyfriend and his family here.

Now I can see paying that if the pieces of chicken were huge pieces but they certainly were not. The flavor of the chicken was well missing. It had no flavor. It's like they dusted the chicken in flour and threw in the fryer. Now I'm an avid dark meat person because of the tendency of it being moist and juicy. The thigh and drumstick they gave me was drier than the Sahara. You probably could use it as a shammy to soak up water after washing your car. The meat on those pieces was pretty scarce and what I could get was just unappetizing. The waffles were somewhat soggy and just didn't hold up to the butter and the syrup. The service was ok and at least I get to say I tried it. I did discover something that was pretty good.

Because our wishlist was long, this was our second food stop of the night.THE FOOD is okay. It's not anything special - just waffle and chicken. I wasn't really sure how to eat it, so I tried different techniques, such as: -pouring gravy unto the waffle-pouring syrup unto the chicken (don't do it)-eating a piece of chicken then a piece of waffle-eating a gravy-soaked piece of chicken and then a syrup soaked piece of waffle -forking in a piece of chicken and waffle in at the same timeI didn't really have an epiphany or discovery of the best way to optimize the taste, because it was just chicken and waffle. Perhaps it was because I had already eaten before coming here, but the chicken/waffle combination was not anything out of this world nor was it any different from my expectations of what chicken and waffles should taste like. THE SERVICE was very friendly. We came in, told the waiter that we just wanted to try their signature dish, because we had heard alot and we were just trying things out. We originally felt bad because there were four of us to a table, and all we wanted was one dish to share. But he was very understanding and super chill. He recommended Scoe's \"1/4 Chix smothered with gravy & onions, 2 waffles, our own mix\" so we got that. He even got us individual plates so we could share!THE AMBIANCE was lively. The place was well decorated, and one of my friends, who had visited the Long Beach location, said this one was classier and nicer than the other one.Okay - so I still don't understand the chicken and waffles thing, but I really enjoyed my experience at Roscoe's and I would definitely visit another time when my stomach isn't full to see if I will have a food epiphany.", "Date": "2013-06-20", "Author_Location": "Hanover, NH"}, {"Author": "Jacob D.", "ReviewID": "_9vvR8jkUj-9OwKVcO4JEg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not only was the food delicious but the service was also great!

A lot of them are fine dining celebrity hot spots but Roscoe's is good old Southern soul food that anyone and everyone can enjoy (although it's had plenty of celeb customers as well). The Gower location of Roscoe's is probably the most famous, even though it's not the original (which I believe is in Long Beach). This stretch of Gower gets some seriously traffic. Especially if you're here late on a Saturday night, like we were. The valet is always backed up, and for us it was no different. Regardless, it's still better than searching for a meter, so just save yourself the headache and cough up the $8.When we showed up, around 9pm or so, there was a bunch of people waiting outside. I thought that meant we were in for an insanely long wait, but to our surprise we were seated immediately. Not only did we have absolutely no wait time, we were also sat in the very back of the restaurant in a small two-person table directly under the, according to the guy that sat us, original Roscoe's neon sign. So cool! As if that wasn't enough, directly in front of me was the framed photos of Obama's surprise visit not too long ago! I took plenty of Instagram photos, believe me.Besides the sign and photos, one thing that stood out was the security. There were humungous security guards made of solid muscle standing at each door. Hmm... Scary or comforting? You be the judge...As it says in its name, you come here for two things -- chicken and waffles. Well if that's what they're famous for, that's what I'm getting! However we took it one step further. Instead of getting one of their delicious looking combos, we ended up getting a bunch of side orders to share. We got four chicken legs, smothered potatoes, mac and cheese, and, of course, one waffle each.The chicken was absolutely amazing! It was so tender and juicy with a nice crispy exterior to round things out. The smothered potatoes were quite possibly the best potatoes I've had. Usually I'm not crazy about these boring, starchy things, but I can appreciate the good ones. The mac and cheese was so gooey and cheesy it put the Vons heat lamp stuff to shame. The waffle too was delicious! One thing you MUST do is take a bite of the chicken and waffle together. I thought it was a weird mixture, but it turned out to be so delicious it basically blew my mind. And yes, it was my first time trying this amazing combination. But it for sure won't be my last time!Roscoe's serves up what can be called the epitome of comfort food. It's listed in plenty of tourist books that chronicle the famous LA hot spots, but unlike most, it totally, completely lived up to the hype!

We weren't ready the first time she came back but took our drink orders down. Then we didn't see her again for at least 15 minutes, and by this time we were starving.

Me: It's okay. I don't mind dark meat. \u00a0(as soon as those words left my mouth, I was hoping he didn't think that was a pickup line)Bouncer: So, you only came for the waffles?Mary: ::giggling:: Yeaaah.

There are some places here in the Bay Area that have tried to capture the magic---Home of Chicken and Waffles in Oakland being the most prominent---but it's just not the same. The concept of eating fried chicken and waffles on the same plate sounds crazy to most people at first, but for some reason, the salty/sweet combination works. Like sex, it's all about chemistry, and Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles is a 20-minute food orgasm on a plate.Now I'll be the first to admit that Roscoe's doesn't have the best fried chicken, but it's very good and I usually get mine smothered in gravy. The waffles on the other hand are really, really good...slightly crispy on the outside and served with LOTS of butter and warm syrup (a lot of people like to pour the syrup all over their chicken, as well). From what I've been told Roscoe's syrup is their own secret recipe, and I actually think the syrup is the key to their success.There are several ways to order at Roscoe's. My old standby is the #2 Scoe's Special, 1/4 dark meat fried chicken, smothered in gravy, with two huge waffles. I generally eat the chicken first and then have the waffles for dessert, but sometimes I mix it up a bit. When I'm with a large group of people, I like to order some of the sides, like red beans and rice, mac and cheese, smothered potatoes, and cornbread.I've been a Roscoe's whore since the mid 90's and over the years, I've brought almost all my friends, coworkers when we were in town for trade shows (including our Japanese CEO who loved the food but was mad that they don't serve alcohol), and I even took my parents to the more ghetto Pico/La Brea location (they got over their initial fears and really enjoyed their food, and my mom asked \"why haven't you brought me here before?\"). It's also the only place I've ever brought anyone where the food was so good it reduced them to cursing after every bite, i.e. \"Goddamn, this is muthafuckin' good\" or \"Muthafucker, this is the best food I've ever had.\"I went home this past weekend and had planned on returning to the Mecca of chicken and waffles in order to do have another taste before I wrote this review/love letter to Roscoe's, but our plans got a little screwed up and we didn't make it.

Fried chicken that has a ton of juicy meat that isn't insanely greasy is hard to come by.

Well, let's ask the waitress!Me: So do people usually put syrup or gravy over their waffles?Waitress: *laughs* Well, we provide syrup for the waffle and gravy for the chicken, but you can really do it anyway you like!Haha, I'm sure she was thinking like \"Silly asian girl. What are you thinking?!\" And alright, so maybe I didn't win because she didn't say that the gravy goes over the waffle like I thought it should...but I did it anyway and it was amazing. So this is how it went:1. Cut a piece of gravy smothered chicken2. Dip the chicken in more gravy3. With the chicken still on the fork, cut a piece of waffle too4. Dip the chicken AND waffle in gravy5. Eat it all in one bite6. Die of happinessSo they also have other things on the menu including chicken *wings* and waffles, chicken and biscuits, eggs, omelettes, chicken liver, sandwiches, chicken burgers, and salads. They have a lot of the standard sides too like fries, mac & cheese (which was yuuummy), rice, grits, greens, corn bread, etc! The vibe of this place was super chill, comfortable and our waitress was suuuuuper sweet and answered all my silly questions :) There's a security guard at the door that's much like a bouncer, which was interesting :D AND their open late!

You can why the sticker shock is going to make people paused.The chicken is always delicious and very tender.The waffles with butter and syrup are better than your store bought Eggo. It is very soft and fluffy. Not a toasted crispy like your Eggo. I suggest to try out their greens.The catch about coming to this place is to avoid weekend's prime lunch and dinner hours as it is a long wait outside the door.

So I review here without fear!*For putting waffles in your name, when the waffles ain't all that, you lose a star. I am a waffle fiend. I was grossly offended. The true waffle fiend hunts for utter lightness, crispness on the outside, buttery light density on the inside, and crevices to cuddle your butter and syrup with. You get crevices, but nothing else, with these imposters.They're basically gigantic, double-trouble eggo waffles. They are limp and heavy before you put the butter and syrup on them. They had not an ounce of crunch to them. Okay, they might have when they left the kitchen, but within mere seconds, they were ... moist. They did have whipped creamy butter, instead of heavy pats. That's a good thing.Alas, I did not complete them, not because I was so full on goodness, but because I was more interested in comforting myself with the good cooking in all the side dishes. Roscoe's, for having deliriously sumptuous candied yams (more like stewed yams in syrup, but never ye mind, I had mini-orgasms and sugary toothroot shudders), and pretty good chicken, and pretty good greens, I shall forgive you many things. Verrrrry good gravy. I did typical bad-for-you comfort food things, like dip my chicken and my fries in the gravy. It was terribly clever, if I do say so myself.Outside the south, it is very hard to get good homestyle cooking unless you go to a transplanted Southerner's house (that would include black folks, we bring the food with us when we bail).

While I enjoy the ambience of the Pico location more, I find that I am near this Hollywood location most often. When passing by, if I have the time, I cant resist the temptation to go inside.The ambience here reminds me of a Southern Church where they might be having one of those pot luck or baked bean dinners. What you typically find here is off the cuff service....which means you will be quickly seated by someone who is just doing there job. You will quickly be asked what you want and your food will arrive rather quickly.Some days, my craving is spot on and I will rave about my food, other days, I wonder if my fond memories are jilted in some way as things will be just ok.The waffles are absolutely delicous (say 8 times out of 10). They are best first thing in the morning when you know they are hot off the iron. They are unlike any waffle I have ever tasted. They come with plenty of syrup and butter too. Usually I scrape off butter at any other establishment, but here I slather it on. Perhaps its the environment in the room that causes me to partake in such cholesterol clogging activity. The first time I ever went to Roscoe's, I remember four giant scoops of softened butter and four containers of hot syrup....usually you get two, and as with most first times, I long for the time when four scoops was what I got (whether or not I used all of it is a different story).Skip the coffee, unless you like it old fashioned and weak, being a trained barista, its god awful for a coffee snob like me. I usually order a diet coke. I drink a lot with my food and the wait staff is happy to refill the glass countless times so that I slosh as I exit.Now for the chicken. I have had it both simply fried and smothered in that delicious onion gravy. If you ask me, stay away from the breast, it WILL be dry. The dark meat however is simply delicious. I prefer my chicken smothered because the gravy is so damned delicious. It will come on a separate plate when ordered with the gravy. Otherwise it will sit nestled next to your waffle awaiting to bathe in pools of syrup. Either way, its pretty delicious.Recently, I tried one of the House combos, simply because if I like a place, I want to try everything on the menu. I had the macaroni and cheese with greens, cornbread, and chicken. I placed the order by phone on a Saturday night and was placed on hold. As I drove into the lot, I finished \u00a0placing the order and told them I was already here. After waiting 50 minutes, I learned they forgot to put in my order. I got some mild apologies and my food free....no complaints here : ) (note although I did get breast instead of leg, even after repeating LeG three times on the order.)The macaroni was just like a modest homemade version. Not the best, but will do when the craving arrives (Swingers on Beverly has a far better late night version). The greens however were extraordinarily tasty and served as perfect fodder for the dry fried breast. Voila! Moist chicken when dipped in the green juice. The cornbread, well, its adequate. Use the butter before biting into the crumbly square. But then again, \u00a0I think Boston Market has the best (there processed Mac n Cheese is up there too...hehe)I suspect I will be visiting again very soon (I am craving it now) as this is a place where fond food memories are made.

So happy in fact that they lifted their piece of chicken to Crystal (my roommate and best friend who I convinced to join Asian Business Students even though she's not Asian or a business student).

It was neither amazing nor heavenly. It was just OK. So don't hype yourself up thinking you're gonna have the best fried chicken ever like I did, because you'll be disappointed. I ordered the #1 SCOE's which came with two pieces of chix and 2 wide, but thin waffles for $10.70 and it was alright. I mean, the chicken skin was on the salty side, and the piece of leg that I got was slightly overcooked. The waffles were delicious but only because they added cinnamon to their batter. Other than that, it tastes like regular ol' waffles. I DO like that their waffles are on the softer side though. It was more like a pancake pretending to be a waffle. I also ordered a side of cornbread thinking it was gonna be the awesomest cornbread ever but nay, it was not. Some quick tips about this place, you don't have to be suckered by the valet people who charge $10 dollars, or have to resort to parking meters. Just drive 2 blocks towards Carlton Way and find free street parking there. Trust me, you'll need the walk after the waffles expand in your stomach. Also, if you want a less salty chicken, perhaps you should order #2 SCOE's because the chicken is bathed in gravy and my friend finished hers so I assumed it was good. Another thing! I saw people complaining about how dry the chicken was. When the server asks you whether you want White or Dark for your chicken, go for dark. White meat (which is usually the breast and wing) is notoriously dry when fried.

Party of three on a summer Sunday at roughly \u00a07pm. I checked us in with the hostess who, when asked, said the wait would be about 20 minutes. We joined the other waiting parties on the sidewalk outside the front entrance. Actual wait time: 9 minutesIt was pretty busy, but it was hardly packed. In fact, I later overheard a waitress telling another waitress that \"this was nothing\". The hostess brought us to our table and gave us each a menu. About a minute later, a waitress kindly asked if she could relocate us to a different table (no big deal). Our new table, #22, only had 2 chairs when we got there, however, an available chair was conveniently just a few feet away. I disregarded the fact the waitress failed to acknowledge the chair shortage; the situation was resolved nearly as fast as it was presented.Wooden tables and chairs plus plenty of chicken decor equals an atmosphere that is simple and homey...casual with a splash of southern country complete with t-shirts for sale.The menus seemed overused, slightly greasy, and poorly formatted. I felt it would have been a bit easier on my indecisive eyes if they hadn't squeezed everything onto a tent-style food and beverage \"list.\" The majority of entrees are pretty straightforward and are comprised of the same key elements; a meal essentially \u00a0consists of a piece of fried chicken, waffles or a biscuit, and perhaps eggs or grits. The average price for a meal was easily $10. My brother ordered the signature meal, a chicken breast served with an order of (1) waffles. From the list of Side Orders, he requested a side of scrambled eggs with onions, and a side order of cornbread. Our colleague pulled the trigger on the chicken sandwich served with fries after being torn between a few different choices. When my turn to order came around I made a coin-flip decision and went with an order of Chicken Chili Cheese Fries (I'd been drinking) and a side order of cornbread from the Side Orders.The table next to ours was a larger party that we shared the sidewalk with while waiting out front for a table. I was pleased to see them already enjoying their food, giving the (hopeful) impression our food wouldn't take very long to arrive.Roughly 10 minutes later our food is placed before us in two waves with my brother's order coming out just shy of a whole minute before the rest of our order. The dishes were piping hot, the presentation was respectable and the portions were ultimately quite satisfying. Throughout the meal we each reiterated how the food was PFG. The meals (and three waters) came to $32 and some change. The overall experience was quite satisfying, although I couldn't say Roscoe's exceeded my expectations. Service was kind yet relaxed and somewhat lacked the comforting, hospitable feel. The kitchen's efficiency is consistent with the simple nature of the \"no substitutions\" menu.

We were shown to our table amid a near full house of fellow diners, even at nearly 11 o clock, the place was booming.Once I had drank in the ambiance and it was time to order, I thought I might as well go with the namesake meal, and the most basic essence of Roscoe's, and that seemed to be the Carol C Special - \"One succulent breast and one delicious waffle\". My apprehensions continued even when it was put down in front of me. Now, I didn't at the time and still I don't know who Carol C is, but after a couple of bites, alternating between pan-fried Chicken and a large waffled all syrupped up, I wanted to make dirty love to this meal's namesake in appreciation. It's one of the best meals I've ever had. My first dinner in Los Angeles became my first, second and third dinner in Los Angeles, returning the next 3 nights and always remaining faithful to my culinary lover, Carol C. But alas, the Carol C special lives at Roscoe's in L.A. and although I wish on a daily basis there were Roscoe's locations anywhere near Toronto, I know we're from two different worlds, but one day we will meet again.", "Date": "2009-04-08", "Author_Location": "Toronto, Canada"}, {"Author": "Denise C.", "ReviewID": "IdQTm0YMo8LmC1PQmGHwOA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Someone took me here in Los Angeles, and I don't know why because \"Chicken and Waffles\" was completely strange to me.

The waffle, even though it was softer than I generally like my waffles, was a great foil to the chicken and even if you're one of those people who doesn't want one thing on your plate to touch another thing on your plate, you gotta try a big bite with a little bit of everything (chicken, waffle, butter, syrup...and hot sauce :D), just to say you did.

In fact, while we are dining, a group of elderly women came in, making their pit stop on their guided tour. I ordered the Obama Special (aka Country Boy), which consists of wings and waffles. Although there are plenty of other choice, for me no there was no other option. Wings, waffles, hot sauce & syrup; the right balance of savory, spicy and sweet, I wanted to eat more. The waffles were amazing; fluffy like pancakes (I despise crunchy waffles) and the fried chicken was probably the best I have ever had. Although I grew up in Florida and it is as south as you can get geographically, it does not really count as \"The South\" so I must admit that I have not had much experience with southern/soul food but regardless my taste buds know a good fried chicken and it was good.My conclusion, Roscoe's House of Chicken & Waffles is definitely a reason alone for me to come back to L.A.", "Date": "2012-06-01", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Enrique S.", "ReviewID": "L3kZSqWLP3-Co1DRRBbAEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everyone was blunt and didn't co sign on no BS, love this place I came here a while ago during a trip to LA, to this day I crave the buckwheat waffle and the biscuits and gravy.

It seemed like a really good idea to get as drunk as possible at 2 a.m. on a Saturday night and go to Roscoe's.With two tallboys of 211 bubbling in our bellies we made our way to Roscoe's door. They have a bouncer guy and you have to wait outside before they let you in to sit, but we were pretty much immediately seated even though the place was full of people. By the time we sat down we were both so drunk that I was surprised people couldn't just look at us and tell how drunk we were. I was kind of swimming in my seat, since I weigh about half as much as my friend and had the same amount of alcohol. I am pretty sure part of my blood had been replaced by 211.When the waiter (or waitress, whoever it was had a face so blurry I can't really recall what gender they were or what language they spoke to me in) came over to us we said we'd never been here before and wondered what everyone orders. They pointed at something on the menu and we said YES THAT PLEASE. Don't remember what it was, specifically, but when it showed up it was a plate of waffles and chicken (surprising, really, considering where we were) and, boy, when I could actually focus my vision on it and stop my head from lolling about on my shoulders like John Paul II, it looked pretty tasty.After saying something like, \"Oh my God, I can't believe I am this drunk,\" we dug into our plates and ate silently, ravenously.Now, I'm telling you, you should listen to all these other reviewers who tell you that the food is good. I probably can't be trusted. I was beyond drunk, not only on a $1 can of malt liquor, but also on self-pity, so just about anything would have tasted good at the time, but...I had preconceived notions of how good chicken could taste. I like chicken. It tastes like chicken and it's hard to screw it up. Roscoe's chicken was really good.What surprised me, however, was how good those waffles were. They were delicious. It was like God came down from his invisible throne in the sky and delivered my drunk ass a plate of spongy wonderful goodness and reconfigured my tastebuds in such a way that when I ate it it was like my tongue had a little clitoris on it that was being caressed lovingly by the ribs on the waffle. I mean, I was drunk, but come on, THAT drunk? The waffles must have been good.All in all: Dang.I have never been back. Subconsciously I am probably scared of something this tasty. Consciously it's just a far drive and I don't really believe the food was as good as it was and if I eat it sober and it isn't really tasty it will forever tarnish the memory of the waffle performing cunnilingus on my tongue. I can't risk it.Fact check: Apparently Roscoe's is only open til midnight. In this review I state that it was 2 a.m., though I am pretty sure it was 1 a.m.. It turns out that I can't possibly be right here, so I'll assume we were there at about 11 p.m. I'll also assume that no one cares but I don't want anybody ever callin' me a liar, ya hear?", "Date": "2009-12-21", "Author_Location": "Whittier, CA"}, {"Author": "Nancy G.", "ReviewID": "O96Du3KknXso-ph1xqjONQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would be lying if I said it wasn't Snoop Dog's show, Fatherhood that brought me to Roscoe's. \u00a0Seeing that he ate there day in and day out, I had to see for myself if it was as good as it was hyped up to be. \u00a0After 20 minutes of waiting in line, I was able to put my curiosity to rest. \u00a0We were seated in the frontal section of the restaurant with very dim lights & wood paneled walls (gave off a barnyard feel). \u00a0The waitress quickly took my order of thigh and waffle, while my friend had the breast and waffle, which she said was amazingly moist.After taking my first bite, I really wanted to ask Snoop, \"what is all the hype?\" \u00a0in my opinion, it wasn't any better than kfc. \u00a0I'm not sure if I was just unlucky that day, but my chicken came out luke warm and had no crunch. \u00a0If anything, I would of much rather opted for kfc. \u00a0It would of been cheaper too. \u00a0The waffle on the other hand was quite tasty. \u00a0It had a great cinnamon-y nutmeg flavor, that i found quite comforting.

I went with the waffle. Come on now, chicken and waffle! Gotta go for the staple. The boyfriend opted for Jeanne Jones Omelette: cheese and chicken omelette with friench fries or waffle. Of course he went for the waffle. Then again he's more of a waffle guy. The food came out relatively quick and did not disappoint. The chicken had a nice crunchy skin and the meat was tender and flavorful. The waffle was fluffy and not dry. Then, taking a combo bite of chicken, waffle and syrup?!

They try, but they simply cannot do this place enough justice. I've eaten many places up and down the west coast, but nothing I've experienced even comes close to the delight that is Roscoe's. And even in light of the fact there are many viable contenders -- particularly with regard to chicken and waffles -- none do it the way Roscoe's does. Moreover, I feel there is no dining experience that could possibly be anymore quintessential Los Angeles.You know the hype -- it's all about the chicken and waffles. You must experience it. Don't be ridiculous and come here and not try it. It's simply uncivilized. As I mentioned, many try (and come close) to carry the chicken and waffles mantle, but none is as great as Roscoe's -- the greatest of all time.That sweet, delicious waffle, drowning in maple syrup, and the crisp, savory chicken, doused in hot sauce -- I'm drooling just thinking of it.The wait at the Hollywood location is generally a long one. And this wasn't always the case, but even during off-hours this location tends to be very busy. The good thing is though that the staff generally buses and turns over tables very quickly. But that doesn't matter when many patrons tend to take their time at their respective tables. Nonetheless, given how busy this location is, their staff is top-notch and gets the job done.The crowding is somewhat alleviated by the expanded dining room.

I did taste a bit of cinnamon in my waffles. My waffles was loaded with scoops of butter \u00a0which look like heaps of ice cream. The butter actually made the waffles taste even better. The \u00a0chicken portion consisted of a wing and nice crispy thigh. My scrambled eggs was cooked a nice running cheesy consistency that I like.

But I like it. I went here with some English types, they didn't really understand any of it.I believe Roscoes is a true celebration of American cuisine, southern roots, and should partner in some capacity with the House of Blues.AT LEAST, they should have free style contests or something, because it could be a lot more than just a restaurant.Consider the line comparable to Pinks, as that's the closest thing I can think of to compare it to.Looking forward to the next time, and although my review is 5 stars-When you are as busy and in high-demand as this place, you are probably going to run into some bad experiences.You can't make everyone happy when you are dealing with high volume in any kind of service field.Hatters gonna hat.

My recovery food consists of high calorie meals with fried meat as the centerpiece of the meal. We agreed that since we were in Los Angeles, Roscoe's was a must. We were fortunate to arrive during one of their slow periods of the day and we had a short wait time. However, after we were seated the wait time carried over and we waited almost 30 minutes before a server came to take our orders. The server's congeniality ameliorated our impatience and displeasure over her delay in taking our orders. The food arrived quickly, which worried me because quickly served food at a restaurant is generally mediocre at best. Also, it worried me that they served our food before they provided us the cutlery. To my surprise the food was delicious. I ordered the Scoe's dish that consists of two waffles and two pieces of fried chicken (breast and leg) covered in gravy. The fried chicken was crispy despite being covered in gravy and it was cooked to perfection. The waffles had the crispy texture that gives awesome waffles that crunch and the aroma of freshly cooked waffles permeated through the air. I don't even think I chewed my food; I must've breathed it in. The decor reminded me of 1980s Los Angeles and I felt like I was in my grandmother's kitchen. Their concept is obviously unorthodox, but despite the unconventionality the food is delicious. The only reason I didn't give this review 5 stars is because of the time it took to get serviced and the slight disorganization of not having our tables equipped with cutlery that resulted in waiting a little bit longer to eat our food. Also, the lack of the 5th star is a result of their policy of not splitting the checks. We didn't know this as we were about to pay which resulted in the bickering associated with settling the check.

I like a little more variety on my plate, especially when your entire plate is going to be one big, syrupy mess anyway. The waffles come with a golf ball-sized butter, and the chicken has that oily, deep-deep fried appeal -- douse in syrup, and you've got your self one reasonably delicious heart attack. Was it good? Yeah, sure... not the best chicken I've had, not the best waffle. That said, there's precious few centrally located restaurants where you're going to get both on the same plate for $15 or less.

It's hella dry and doesn't melt in my mouth.There's always a wait, but it isn't too bad.

I might've mumbled it through my chicken'd waffled filled mouth.. either way, it was good.. no, great!The chicken was juicy and oh-so-flavorful.. the skin wasn't caked on with coating, but \u00a0nice and thin which kept it so so crispy and definitely not sopping in grease. Ick, grease bad.. The waffle, though not crispy as a belgian, was not soggy either.. just a good balance of fluffiness. It was scrumptious... It tasted like it had cinnamon, but I could be wrong. Though other reviews stated some cinnamon-y notes... so maybe I'm not too far off.So, growing up I would never think to eat a savory fried chicken with a sweet waffle with a nice light syrup.. and, now, I'm a bit saddened that I didn't.

Personally, its the waffles that make the meal for me. These are the most unbelievable waffles I have ever had anywhere. They are fluffy, flavorful, and are perfect with the massive amount of butter and syrup they give you. The fried chicken was decent, certainly good, but nothing particularly special. Get the gravy if you get the chicken; added a whole other level to the quality. Overall, it's a legendary place that you should try if you get the chance.

And there was no way I wasnt going to make sure I went to Roscoe's. I mean, this place is world famous for what they do. I think every major city has a copy cat Roscoe's, but I resisted trying any of them. Finally it was time to hit the real thing.I went around 2pm on a Sunday, and there was about 25 people outside waiting to get a taste. I spent my time shopping a couple of the local street vendors and taking a few pics of the \"Hollywood\" sign. \u00a0You can see it from Gower St., even thought it is way high up the hill. \u00a0I went alone, so I had a shorter wait than some, a little over 30 minutes.It was dimly lit inside, compared to the sunny day outside, but after my eyes adjusted to the menu, I didnt know what to choose. I ended up ordering a fruit punch / lemonade drink, a waffle with chicken breast, added a wing and some grits. My order came quick so i was very happy. My waffle wasnt hot, but warm. I was wishing it would be hotter, so that my butter would melt easy, but no big deal, i surely wasnt about to complain. The chicken was hot though and it looked soo good. I have to tell you, the combination of the sweet and salty meal was amazing. Thing is, you can try to create this at home, but it wont come out the same. Yes, you can make a waffle, but i think they may have their own mixture or something. While I was eating, one of the street vendors came in the building and said \"Excuse me Roscoe's customers, if you parked on this side of the street, the police are checking the meters and you need to make sure you are current or they will tow your car. Thank you\". This place, despite how world famous it is, still has a neighborhood feel to it.

The first one I mentioned just recently in my Counter Burger review, and the second issue is that you often get reviews by people who simply can't discern between good and bad food - even some of the crappiest places I can think of will get a couple 5 star reviews/ratings - That's whats good and bad about Yelp cuz you get everybody's valid feedback, but it just sucks having to go through all the ones you might not relate to. I've got an ex and a couple friends who can attest to this because getting their feedback is often answered with \"oh ya, I like it\" or \"yea, it was good\" for every eff'n meal good or bad?!?!, hahaha!! Well, what did you like about it? \"I don't know, but it was good\"...did you know the salmon you ate was rancid and it was burnt \"oh well, I liked it\". Ok, thanks. That was very insightful, and ideally I'd only think this type of rating system is only good in the bedroom.Now taste is subjective but preparation isn't. Since I cook a lot, and I've worked in the restaurant industry, I know cook'n mutha' eff'n fried eff'n chicken is eff'n nearly impossible for me to get like Popeye's chicken. I've tried lard, Crisco, bacon grease, different types of oils, different kinds of flour, starch combo's, buttermilk marinating, and multiple preparation/cook'n techniques but none of them gets me close to the holy grail of fried chicken which is Popeye's. I love me some Popeye's.This isn't a Popeye's review, so I will say Roscoes is no Popeye's. The preparation is a lot more basic here, and I'd liken it to \"home cook'n\". I could easily replicate this chicken in my own kitchen which means \"I'm not impressed\" - hahahaha!!

The place people just can't seem to get enough of? The place I just stood in front of for 45 min waiting to get inside? Add this one to the same list Pink's is on for \"Most Overrated Places to Eat in LA.\". My gf and I arrived and were met by a gathering of people waiting in front. They take your name at the door, which is roped off, and you stand around outside for a loonnnggg time. We got in about 40-ish minutes later, were handed our tiny menus and seated near the kitchen. The service was prompt for such a busy joint, so they get some props there for staying on top of things. The menu was smaller than I expected, but I planned on ordering one thing and one thing only: chicken and waffles. But, oddly enough, they don't have a big \"CHICKEN AND WAFFLES\" special listed anywhere of note. It's just crammed in there, listed as \"1.\" (without gravy & onions) or \"2.\" (with). So, I ordered one of those (at a steep $10.20) and my gf got a chicken burger with fries. The food came in about 15-20 min., quicker than I anticipated. Visually, I was drawn in by the succulent yet bizarre pairing of fried chicken and waffles dripping in melted butter and syrup. However, once we dug in we learned that the aesthetics outweighed the actual taste. My chicken tasted like everyday fried chicken. They claim to use their \"own special mix\", but it honestly didn't taste any better than KFC, and it sure as hell wasn't any healthier. The waffles had a hint of cinnamon, which was a nice touch, but they were flaccid, spongy and tepid. I thought they were cranking these out all day?

I savored the experience of mixing my chicken and waffles together, but it was hardly the revelatory food-gasm that many make it out to be.

Anyway, back to Roscoe's.I love this place. I love their gravy-smothered chicken. I love their gravy through a straw. I love the fluffy waffles that break up my enjoyment of said chicken. I love this place, which is why it's getting 5 stars. So don't look for anything else from this review other than a few stories because... yes, I am that crazy Yelper that writes ridiculously long anecdotes.Almost 12 years ago I decided that I needed a little break from high school, so I decided to ditch school for an entire week. I managed to keep myself busy for most of the week, but by Friday I had run out of ways to amuse myself. Not knowing where to go I decided to visit my friends at their school down the road and convince them to play hookie with me. I thought I'd have to talk them into it, but my car decided break down right in front of their school, so they had no choice but to help me push it down the road, which worked out in my favor. All that pushing worked up a mighty hunger and they were already late for class, so one of my friends suggested we go to Roscoe's. At that age I wasn't all that keen on driving 30 miles just for food, so I'd never been, but since my car was out of commission, I wouldn't have to do the driving. Despite being a weekday, we still had to wait an hour to be seated. Up until this point in my life, I had never ditched so many days in a row, driven 30+ miles just for food, waited for longer than 30 minutes just to sit down in a restaurant, or experienced a food orgasm. My trip to Roscoe provided a first on all those counts and that was the first of many trip. When I got home later that day my mother was waiting for me at the door and played back the voicemail that the school had left, inquiring about my absence... so yes, that sweet memory ended on a sour note, but to this day I still believe it was totally worth it.Years later I missed a plane back to Sacramento after running my first marathon because I took too long enjoying my meal at Roscoe's. I ended up sleeping at the airport since I didn't want my folks to know I'd missed my flight. Was Roscoe's worth sleeping on those crappy seats in LAX? Yes.

And there is nothing quite like it in Washington, DC where now I reside. Being that I hadn't eaten here in a few years and was traveling back to the west coast for a vacation, I specifically requested it as the first stop on our way to Oxnard from the airport. Of course the 110 and 101 traffic was dummy stupid on a Saturday afternoon, so we were good and starving by the time we arrived... only to find a huge mass of people waiting outside for a table. Ugh. Yes, Roscoe's is that famous, and that damn delicious...Rather surprisingly, it actually didn't take us long to get in. We were quoted 30-35 minutes, but it felt more like 15-20. Props for that. Our party of five (three adults and two children) was seated at somewhat of a cramped table in the front corner, which none of us really cared about because we were ready to have a worship experience with this fried yumminess. To say that we enjoyed the $100 worth of food we ordered was an understatement (see pic). Everything placed in front of us was muy sabroso, minus the \"sweet tea\" they had the audacity to give me. My best friend liked it, but my persnickety palate decided to pass. It had a weird kind of fruity flavor and didn't taste \"southern\" sweet like I've grown accustomed to. If I can remember properly, all together we ordered a mix of fried chicken breasts (which were huge and moist), mac and cheese, greens, yams, waffles, cornbread, and sweet potato pie. Thumbs up for it all! The waffles are made of a special house recipe, which to me seem to have a cinnamony-nutmegish flavor. Definitely far from the Belgian-style ones that I lust after, but tasty nonetheless. My favorite items were the greens and mac and cheese. Sooooo good. The downside to this positive review, however, is that the service was a tad bit on the slow side. It took our server at least five minutes to greet our table, which I believe to be completely unacceptable as a former restaurant hospitalian. At one point I had to ask for a drink twice, which resulted in me getting two Cokes back to back o_O This all occurred after I had consumed half of my meal, of course, which was highly annoying.

So I shared it with my friend. \u00a0We got the #1 Scoe's 1/4 Chix prepared Southern style, with 2 waffles, our own private mix - $10.20. \u00a0The fried chicken wasn't oily so that was a plus. \u00a0Its not like KFC's dripping oil and sloppy. The meat was tender and juicy and dipping it into the gravy sauce and biting the waffle together was DELICIOUS! \u00a0I thought the breast meat would be dry. Nope, the meat was tender and juicy!! We got some of their slides - fries, mash potato, biscuit, and mac and cheese. \u00a0My friend and I couldn't even finish our meal so we had to take it to go. \u00a0The prices are good and the portions are big, so sharing is well worth it!I also got the Sun Rise drink ~ $3.25Finding parking in that area is HARD!

Roscoe's is amazing! I know, I know - I was probably the last Angeleno who hadn't been here, and I'm sure a lot of people find it gimmicky and/or overrated. But I was thrilled. Somehow I missed out on all those freshman year Roscoe's trips - when it was as much a USC staple as El Cholo. So friend and I finally made it out to the Hollywood location (I wanted to go to the original, but Hollywood was closer and, as you'll soon learn, every bit as authentic). First of all, the scene outside of the unassuming Gower storefront is like no other - as if a chunk of Crenshaw had been transplanted a couple miles north. All the black regulars were not only super stylish, they all knew each other! It felt like a small town, down home country watering hole. There was a wait to be seated but believe me: the people watching outside on the sidewalk is worth it. Once we got in, we were placed at a table up on a little elevated area in the front room (the room by the kitchen is bigger but super loud). The menus are long and somewhat indecipherable... you'd think a restaurant that is famous for one, classic dish would feature \"Chicken and waffles\" in big bold letters, screaming out at you from the menu. But you have to decide how much you want (I guarantee your eyes are bigger than your stomach) and what piece of the chicken you prefer. But anyway, the wait staff are SUPER FRIENDLY so they'll help you figure it out. Our waitress, who was gorgeous and had the most beautiful voice, brought us out refills of our drinks when we had barely begun the first and said \"Oh I'm sorry - I thought you'd want more!\" Very sweet and attentive. Beware: their sweet tea is suuuuper sweet 'n southern, and is hard to stop. The food came out quickly and still hot and we wasted no time digging in. To tell the truth, there is nothing really unique about the Belgian-style waffles or the fried chicken, but it is their studied combination that is genius. The best part is the assembly of each bite - pulling off a piece of hot chicken, squirting it with Louisiana hot sauce, stabbing a chunk of buttered waffle, and dunking the whole thing in maple syrup. HEAVENLY. The cornbread we got was hot, crumbly and delicious too. Afterward you are stuffed with a lethargic, carbo-loaded bliss. Oh and good prices for everything.

If I wanted to dine on spongy waffles and over fried chicken strips, I would go to IHOP. For succulent pieces of fried goodness, I'll take Roscoe's thank you very much. I always get the Carol B. Special and a Sunset to drink. I also think that the quality of service and food depends on the location.

First of all, I'm not a big fan of fried chicken (I'm chickenskinaphobic), but my daughter and her friend were totally bowled over by the 1/4 white that they each ordered. \"I'm so full ... AND I CAN'T STOP!\" was their reaction.I'm a fan of the Jeanne Jones omelet plus chili and waffle. Very cheesy, big chunks of white chicken. The chili overlay has a sort of grainy texture that may not live up to the expectations of some chili affectionados, but I'm good with it.As to the waffles, NICE! I'm not a fan of crunchy waffles, so if that's your thing, you'll be disappointed (as apparently several reviewers here were). Soft, nice, lots of butter and more than lots of syrup. WAY TO MUCH food for $11 and change, but no complaints from me.It's a busy place, so your best bet is to come during off-hours (before noon, before 5pm). Street parking is difficult and waiting for a seat during normal hours can be lengthy and there's really no good place to wait there, so that's why I'm holding back a star. Service is pretty quick.

The cheese eggs were DELICIOUS! \u00a0The fries were soggy and limp with not quite enough salt. \u00a0However, the ranch dressing flavor was good and help with the salt factor. \u00a0The Lisa's delight was especially good, very nice and tangy with the right amount of sweetness. \u00a0I've saved the waffle for last, it wasn't my favorite, I am a bigger fan of crunchy waffles but that's not a big deal, it made it easier to shovel the eggs nd chicken in together. \u00a0After all, if it were hard, it might've cut my mouth up andi might've not gotten all the flavors in! \u00a0I have recently had my tonsils removed and it has slightly, ever so slightly, heightened my taste buds. \u00a0In this case I was very sensitive to a spice in the waffle batter, I think it was the nutmeg, it made it a little bitter for me. \u00a0Again, surgery, taste buds, I think I'm still adjusting.Overall, Roscoe's is always a good late night snack joint if you have some...ok, a lot of time to wait. \u00a0The service is ok, I think they are always so busy that the wait staff is always rushing and seemingly annoyed. \u00a0It would e nice if they upgraded the old table tops, they're a little sticky and gooey even with the busboys attention. \u00a0Parking on the street is usually metered but free after...8 pm, I believe.", "Date": "2012-08-26", "Author_Location": "West Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "aricka a.", "ReviewID": "nlI3sxzYwoKia6tv4k5HoA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not recommend after hours.

Therefore i knew i was next to be called. NOPE! nothing. i check with the hostest again! I'm STILL FOURTH ONE DOWN!!! how the *BLEEP* is this even possible! i TRIED to explain to the host (who recognized and acknoweledge my patience) that the seating arrangment is UN ORGANIZED & UNFAIR, which he agreed, but he said it wasnt in his hands.... it's in the security guards pick!! WHAT KIND OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THIS?! In conclusion, security guard. Who even DRESSED unprofessionally in a ALL RED dickies botton down shirt and TATTOO of the los angeles dodgers \"LA\" symbol tatted on the BACK of his bald head! Didnt \"care\" about my wait & even in trying to come into agreement with the security guard, about my nearly 2hour wait he, in response yelled & screamed negative words and even threated.

I just hate the original Gower St. establishment.I have been here twice now, and both times they made us wait so long that we decided to leave. \u00a0The first time it wasn't their fault. \u00a0It was Sunday at noon, and there was a whole church crowd lined up to eat their chicken. \u00a0Fine, we'll just order to-go. \u00a0Many orders of chicken, waffles, eggs, gravy on the side, and all their other goodies go in, and in maybe 15-20 minutes, the food was ready. \u00a0Cool, I thought, they filled our order pretty fast. \u00a0I was very excited to go home (or in this case, to my friend's nearby apartment) to break open the chicken.We get \"home\" and hungrily start to dig into the food when we realize that they forgot what I consider to be the most important ingredient: the gravy. \u00a0Now, of course their waffles and chicken are good without it, but to me the gravy is what makes them GREAT. \u00a0And I'm positive we asked for gravy (in fact we may have asked for extra gravy).Strike one for this Roscoe's.A few months later, we decide to come here again, this time in the middle of the night (they do open till 4), after a bar or something. \u00a0We get there and are told that there's an hour wait. \u00a0Kinda long, but everyone wanted chicken so we all gladly waited. \u00a0Our name goes on a list and we sit down and wait with all the other 4th meal goers. \u00a0Not 15 minutes later, two scantily-dressed girls strut up to the host and ask to be seated. \u00a0To our utter amazement, he takes them in and sits them down at a table. \u00a0What happened to the waiting list?! \u00a0Will showing my cleavage and maybe a thigh and half a cheek shorten my waiting time? \u00a0Is that how they roll? \u00a0We decided to wait it out still, because girls get away with things like cutting in line all the time, and it seemed like they were still seating all the \"normal\" people in a timely manner in the order they arrived at the restaurant. \u00a0We wait about an hour and a half when the last group before us on the waiting list get seated, and by then our stomachs were growling and our mouths watering for some of their chicken. \u00a0Then, when the next table opened up, the host actually had the gall to seat another group, even though we all saw them arrive about 20 minutes after us! \u00a0We went to ask him what the heck that was about, and he just gave us attitude, and basically asked us to leave. \u00a0!@#$#$#@~~@#! \u00a0We waited our turn like everyone else! \u00a0If we knew the host was going to hand-pick who gets to go in and who doesn't, we would have taken our business elsewhere without wasting 1.5 hours waiting in the streets of Hollywood! \u00a0What the heck kind of service is that?!So anyway, to me this Roscoe's does not exist anymore. \u00a0If I want Chicken and Waffles, I go to the Pasadena one. \u00a0Sure, it may not have as much character as this one, but at least I get to eat without being discriminated against.", "Date": "2007-05-07", "Author_Location": "Pasadena, CA"}, {"Author": "Juan M.", "ReviewID": "s21wMYql878G5lQY0tVGXA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I know my two Stars could be considered blasphemy, but this was based on my experience on a late Saturday night which probably isn't the best time to go but I got home late and decided I would call ahead and take my chicken home. \u00a0When I got there my order wasn't ready and I waited an additional 20-30 mins, I got home they hooked me up with two tiny dry pieces of dark meat only. \u00a0 The waffle was ok, my Mac and cheese was delicious but small and expensive. \u00a0I'm sure this place is good just don't come to the Hollywood location it's just not worth it. \u00a0Next time I'll try the one in pasadena and give them another chance.", "Date": "2012-05-20", "Author_Location": "Arcadia, CA"}, {"Author": "Tommy C.", "ReviewID": "omfoLF-h5kAVuQ3wVgMCiQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "OVER...RATED... 30 minute wait to go inside for some dry a$$ chicken and average waffles.

For me though, heaven would have to be a cross between Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, AND ANOTHER ROSCOE'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES! Yep, I was THAT blown away but the sheer over the top quality, and feel of this whole place. I came here from San Jose CA, where the only fried chicken we have is either KFC (garbage), or Popeyes (much better tasting garbage). As far as waffles go, I hear there's a good brand of frozen waffles you can get at any grocery store called Eggos (good until you had an ACTUAL waffle, then its \u00a0garbage). I only had food from here brought to me from LA to San Jose before so I was VERY interested in trying to all-mighty Roscoe's in its entirety and all its glory. I proceeded to order 2 breasts, 2 thighs, and a waffle. As I finished ordering, I saw a very small sign that said \" ECONOMY SPECIAL! 6$ for 5 thighs! To-go orders only. So I did what any self respecting man and lover of fantastic chicken would do, I ordered 3 economy specials, duh! The wait to be seated was something like almost 2 hours so we ordered our food to go, as we were on our way back home to San Jose anyway. While waiting for our orders, I noticed there was a couple pictures of President Obama at Roscoe's. I thought that was pretty cool and that added a whole new depth of hype to the experience. I mean come on... THE PRESIDENT went out of his way to come here. That's kind of a big deal. Our orders finally came out and I love that they show you everything you ordered before they hand you the bags. I think this is something that EVERY place should do to avoid getting wrong orders. We headed back to the car and proceeded like kids who have just found a treasure chest on a deserted island, to open our containers of food...First thing I saw was the most golden colored, deliciously smelling 2 breasts I have ever seen. It made the KFC breasts I have become so use to, look like a murky pile of skin and bones. Right away I tore of a huge chunk of skin and the whitest and juiciest meat I have ever seen and inhaled it. OH MY GOSHHHHHH! I swear my whole life just flashed before my eyes just to let me know that nothing else in this world has even come close to being compared to the sacredness that I have just eaten. Absolute perfect. Next I tried to succulent thighs and before I knew it I had finished 8 of them. The skin on the chicken is so crispy and retains so much flavor. As full as I was, I knew I had to at least try to finish the waffle. Unlike the waffles I have become accustomed to, which are crunchy and small, this waffle was big and fluffy. It had a nice soft texture and a rich cinnamon-like flavor. I slathered that bad boy in butter and syrup and took a knife and fork to it. It was the most brilliant way to finish of the meal of gods. What ensued next was a nap for the next several hours. I finally realized what the Eurythmics were singing about when they said \" Sweet dreams are made of these. \"", "Date": "2011-11-11", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Alison H.", "ReviewID": "lwTfnRscr2mWQxW4HWNO8w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "How can you go wrong with chicken and waffles?

Ever since that night I been head over heels for that place and go every chance I get. I will purposely make errands in that direction so that we can stop in for dinner after.

As exhausted and drained as we were from that 4 AM wake up to the grueling run literally in mud, the idea of Roscoe's was extremely appealing that night.We hopped in the car and chose the Hollywood Roscoe's as our destination of feasting. The parking CAN be a pain (there is really only metered parking or valet) but we were able to snag a metered spot whose metered payment ended at 8 PM. We only had to pay 30 minutes worth of parking since we arrived at 7:30 PM. Win! Unfortunately, we were stuck in a line that quoted 30-45 minutes until we could enter. I took this as a good sign that the food was going to be great since it was a Sunday night and it was still packed. After about 45 minutes, we were quoted another 10 minutes...which sucked but we had already stuck it out and were craving fried chicken. We were finally called in and I saw that the restaurant itself is pretty roomy - there are two relatively big but divided sections. We were given our menus and were surprised at how many options there were! Since I wasn't super hungry, I decided to go with the Carole C Special. \u00a0This included 1 chicken breast and 1 waffle. It doesn't sound like too much but it was definitely A LOT once I received my plate. The chicken breast is HUGE! The skin was crispy and dipping the chicken into the syrup actually made it a little less dry. Other than that, I was disappointed at how dry the chicken was on the inside. I imagined the chicken to be juicy and succulent. The waffle was yummy though. It was a little bit on the flat and soft side as I was expecting a crispy waffle, but the flavor of it made up for my expectations. The waffle had a great cinnamon taste to it. My friend also got the same Carole C. Special item and we were dead after being quite close to finishing our plates. We must have been hungry after that run.My other friend ordered the Herb's Special that came with 2 waffles, 1 thigh and 1 breast. He finished his whole plate but not before having to \u00a0take a nap before the last few pieces. That's a nice thing about Roscoe's - you don't have to feel jipped of food since they give you PLENTY. We also ordered a side of biscuits and their famous mac 'n cheese which was difficult for us to finish. We should have stuck with our plates and not been too ambitious.I would return again...but not for a while. Service was great and I am finally able to cross this landmark off of my list.

Anyway my recent virgin visit to Roscoe's was out of complete chance. After getting out of an incredible show by St. Vincent at The Music Box (shameless plug), my friend and I realized we were pretty hungry. I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app on my phone and, lo and behold, I see 'Roscoe's House of Chicken & Waffles' come up. Even more tempting was the fact that it was still open at a late hour and less than a block away on foot. Onward we trekked!As I walked in, I already was liking the ambience of the joint. Lots of wood paneling and a very home-y/country cabin vibe. The perfect environment to enjoy their famous dish. We were seated right away (keep in mind, it was within a half hour of closing). There were a lot of option on the menu, more than I imagined, but I wanted to keep it simple for my first experience. I ordered a waffle and one chicken breast. It seemed strange to be eating both at the same time but my apprehension soon turned into delight when the meal was laid before me. The waffle comes with a slab of butter or a cup of syrup. I've never been one for other fancy toppings so I was more than pleased. The syrup has just the right amount of sugary-ness, with that thin consistency that I'm partial too. As for the waffle, it took up almost the entire plate. It's not Belgian-style. Instead it's relatively thin and completely delicious. Then there was the chicken still to devour. It was perhaps a bit dry and didn't seem super fresh, which may or may not have had something to do with it being near closing time. Nevertheless, it shouldn't matter what time you come. You pay the same amount as everyone else throughout the day, so the food ought to be just as fresh. Despite this, the chicken breast was still pretty darn tasty. Just the right amount of herbs and seasoning and juicy and tender white meat.Oh, and my friend just had a side dish of macaroni and cheese which she said she liked but I cannot personally attest to. So will I be returning to Roscoe's whenever the mood and opportunity strikes again in Hollywood? Absolutely. I'm very eager to try the rest of their menu.P.S.

Not much flavor to the waffle itself, so it needed a generous slathering of butter and syrup to make it enjoyable. Neither the butter or syrup were anything special either though so it really came out to just a \"meh\" experience. I've had better waffles at diners for much less money. The chicken was fried nicely and had good flavor. I'm a West Coast guy, so maybe I just don't have that sweet spot in my heart for chicken paired with waffles that some do, but while they are both things I like in general, having them together in the same meal just didn't do anything wonderful for me. Over $10 for the dish is the main reason I can't give it more stars..

Sitting in the Styrofoam boxes, all I could smell was the maple syrup, even though all the syrup containers were tightly closed. The chicken was deliciously fried but NOT greasy (unlike popeyes, which is equally delicious but 5x as greasy). After figuring out how to eat both the waffles and the chicken with knife and fork, I resorted to using my hands to eat both...which is okay because all orders come with wet naps! I ordered the thigh and leg and both were tender, moist and perfectly seasoned. Dipping the waffles in the gravy is really good as well. I wouldn't recommend ordering the fries, there's nothing special about them besides that they're FRESH and hot, I burnt my tongue.

Finally, I geared up to have an exciting taste of Southern food again but in this City of Filmdom and it delivered! The chicken was scrumptious to its juiciness and moistness! The waffles were familiar and great sustenance with the cinammon-y taste of the syrup. The coleslaw filled with goodness of a mixture. Corn-it to the moistness cornbread. Unbelievably, the Pecan Pie and the Sweet Iced Tea quenched every bit of my Southern-y soul. The restaurant's filled with diners all enjoying their meals. A Southern feeling inside this soul food place. Country-like wooden furnishings and southern music accompanies the tummy-filling. My tastebuds were appreciating. Service was amiable and attentive.

The chicken and waffles combine forces to ease you from stress and really drown you in the flavor. Real soul food.
