If you are just going to the bar on a Saturday night there might be a line outside and a line on the 13th level as well.

The night was young and we decided to stroll down the streets of LA over here for a drink. There wasn't much of a line so we decided to come on up and have a drink. I forget the series of events, but you basically take elevators, stairs and whatnot to get to the top of the building. There, you'll find yourself outside with a great view of the city. It was a bit of a chilly night and I was wearing summery clothes as I was not expecting to be out so late. Plenty of people were there that we had to find a spot near the wall to stand, chat and have a drink.

It was my first time going to a rooftop bar in the daytime and it was very easy to go straight to the top floor, unlike during peak hours (weekends and nighttime). You enter a building and take an elevator to the 13th floor (the button has a picture of a bird on it). Then you get out and go through another elevator to the 15th floor, which is the first floor of perch. I was greeted immediately by a hostess and told her I was only here for drinks so she allowed us to go up to the second deck of Perch.I went around 5 PM on a Monday and people were slowly trickling in for after work drinks. The view was really pretty in the daytime. You can pretty far from one end but if you face towards the tall buildings, you don't see much because all the tall buildings are towering and blocking your view. Nighttime has a great view of Pershing Square and all the lights of DTLA's skyline.On the first floor, they have lots of the heaters so even on a cold winter night, it is still pretty warm while you sit and drink on the patio. I have never gone to Perch on a weekend so I have never experienced it being super crowded and the long lines. I have always gone on a week night where it is less crowded and more tamed.Drinks are pricey but you are paying for a great view of DTLA. Dress code isn't too strict.

Upon arrival they had given away our table.. Disappointing as we were all starving.. I would have appreciated to get this info over the phone when I called, so my expectations were managed better. We had to wait for about 45 min and were then seated. So dinner turned into a really late dinner... So don't be late!

We saw it walking around downtown and I just had to stop by for a rooftop terrace drink. It was pretty packed with a mixed crowd. All the windows/doors open to the beautiful sunset and warm breeze. First we sat at the bar on the 13th(?) floor, had a drink and ordered mussels. Then walked around the exterior, enjoyed the view and live music, then returned to enjoy of appetizer. Unfortunately, the mussels weren't great... they were super small and not flavorful - although the saffron garlic broth was yummy with the garlic crostini's, it was barely good enough to finish - fortunately we just wanted a little bite before our late dinner resos at another place. After we closed at the bar, we went to the 15th (?) floor - the higher rooftop patio - which was crowded but it was perfect timing to watch the sunset and take a couple pictures. I give this place such high ratings because it is beautiful, the energy and atmosphere is so so special, and regardless of how unappealing the mussels were, everyone in the restaurant who was dining looked happy and their dishes looked delicious!

We had the beet salad, filet mignon, and a flat iron steak. We were impressed; 3) The view and the ambience are very nice, assuming you sit in the right area which leads me to the minuses:1) The outside table they gave us was located around the building in an area that I would consider an afterthought. It was in a small, narrow strip facing south and away from all the action. Almost like we didn't belong with the rest of the patrons. And as small and tight as the seating area was, they kept trying to shuffle tables around us to accommodate five people that really should not have sat so closely next to us, but they did anyway. It was disruptive but they did apologize to us; 2) The music - I don't often use this word but in this case it applies. It was cheesy. A small live band playing Linda Ronstadt type of music. I would expect to see something like this at the Dresden Room (which is more of a mockery) but not on a rooftop in downtown LA. It did not help that the speaker above our heads was blown, which I informed the server of. They would be much better off with the DJ that later spun; 3) this is a minor point but our plates kept spinning on the glass table top as we were trying to cut our steaks. I think a tablecloth would've helped.So my three stars rating is really a combination of five stars for service and food and one star for location and the music.

I was not at all angry; he immediately brought me a new drink. He was very accommodating and courteous by moving us to a larger table with a grander view of the DTLA buildings. Dwight, thank you; you're the man! My date ordered a prime rib: medium-rare, this was melt-in-your-mouth tender and the portion was generous. I ordered the ravioli: The shell was al-dente, the inside packed a punch! The sauce was a godsend and I stole some fries from my date to dip it in that sauce. Alice was our server and she was really perky, enthusiastic, and attentive. Enjoying our drinks, food, and the view, Alice came out with a surprise, complimentary dessert; it was a pudding: with some fruit and sea salt lightly sprinkled on top. The salty-sweet combination was harmonic.Tiffany, the greeting hostess, came out to our table and asked, \"So what are you guys doing after? I can provide you a list of all the 'hot' bars in the area.\" That was so kind of her but we did come for the bar here. She did give us some great recommendations and was compelled. As we were about to leave, Dwight stopped us on our tracks and said, 'You must check out the roof-top bar, follow me.\" He escorted us past the line and to the stairwell; to my amazement this bar was gorgeous.

REASON FOR GOING: Both my friends & coworkers recommended this place to me and I wanted to see what was all the rage and so planned my birthday dinner here for a group of 10. Friends came out to dine and drink in LA from Orange County & San Diego for my birthday at this specific location. EXPECTATIONS vs REALITY: Perch really lives up to its reputation. The staff were all very friendly and helpful from the get go. They were so welcoming and completely unpretentious, which is different from the LA stereotypes held by people outside of LA. FOOD: We ordered the mussels, seared salmon over veggies, filet mignon with potatoes and asparagus, several drinks such as the penicillin, variety of beer, some wines, and other drinks such as a gin and tonic, and mojitos. We had quite the group of people so everyone pretty much ordered everything on both the food and drink menu. It was fantastic. Everything was delightful. The food is mostly French cuisine, but it wasn't heavily garlic and butter based like most French places. It was decent delicious food for the venue for what it was and the drinks were strong and delightful.AMBIANCE: I came on a Saturday night - It was packed and vibrant; and the energy was palpable. It was crowded at the bar and the live band played beautiful classics in the jazzy jazz style. We sat at an intimate table for 10. I absolutely love the classic decor and high ceilings on the 15th floor. Dinner & drinks were served & fabulous. We then moved up to the 16th floor for more drinks and to bask in the view... Let me tell you, the view is unmatched. Highly recommended venue and the ambiance both inside and outside was just stunning.CLOSING THOUGHTS: It really is the most romantic spot and although it may not be the best for a large party of friends to dine, it is great for a close group of friends. I was lucky to have a table for 10 people who all greatly enjoyed the night at Perch. I also heard the brunch here fantastic. Be sure to make reservations via Open Table. I strongly recommend doing that; you can bypass the line that way in the evenings. I don't know about brunch, but I'll be back again soon to try the brunch menu and, of course, enjoy the view from this fantastically elevated resting place.", "Date": "2014-06-09", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Mitch C.", "ReviewID": "_4dkFx32IsnRmiAE8a6UPQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great balance of food, ambiance, chill and hip!!", "Date": "2014-07-11", "Author_Location": "La Crescenta, CA"}, {"Author": "Krista T.", "ReviewID": "IQTg4l-N9EvPoqe_GygRmQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Been here twice and both times surprisingly really enjoyed the food, but I think I got lucky with what I ordered, and by lucky I mean did my Yelp research a bit before hand.MUST ORDER the brussel sprouts.

I work in Bunker Hill and have been frequenting Perch for quick drinks for over a year now. Last Wednesday a colleauge and I showed up for a drink and truffle fries. Let me set the scene for you: Sunny Wednesday afternoon. 5pm. Busy bar area, not busy lounge area, mostly empty outside patio. We exit the elevator and are greeted by 2 hostesses who ask us if we have reservations. I say \"No, we'd just like a quick drink and fries.\" From my experience, it seems that as soon as someone says \"No, I don't have reservations\" a gear clicks in their head and they turn on the attitude. I ask if we can sit \u00a0in the currently empty patio and they say no. I ask if we can have fries upstairs they say no, no food upstairs. We're told we can sit at the bar. We walk over, it's busy. Let me just say this is routine, a little dance we dance every time I visit Perch. I've obliged in the past- and the bar was just fine. What would you do when there's still an hour until 6pm dinner reservations start and the bar is packed? Yeah, we walk outside and sit at the tiniest possible table. It's worked before. We sit down and are approached by what I'm guessing is one of the managers. In snarky fashion she tells us these tables are reserved for dinner parties after 6. I say it's 5pm. We're ready to order now and will be done before they need the table. She thinks about it and says \"let me see what I can do\" meanwhile... the clock keeps ticking. She comes back with a waitress and says we'll take care of you but we need the table by 6:15. AGREED (wasn't that what I proposed initially?) So we get our drinks and fries and ask our waitress to bring the bill so that we're ready to leave. She says not to worry, no rush. THANK YOU finally someone's friendly. The clock keeps ticking. People have trickled in but the patio is still mostly empty. We pay the bill. It's 6pm. It's a sad thing to sit there, watching the sunset, high atop DTLA and realize you can count the number of times you've had good service after more than a year's worth of visits on one hand. It's really that sad. Please lose the snooty, pretentious attitude and let us just enjoy an hour before your dinner rush or let me take my fries and drink upstairs. It's simple really.

The entrance to the building is unassuming but helpfully says PERCH in large letters. You take the elevator to the 13th floor, where you get off and then get on another elevator to go to the 15th floor. This takes you directly to the bistro, which is where you would go if you wanted to have actual food here. I had read on Yelp that the food here was not good, so we completely ignored the bistro and took the stairs to the rooftop (16th floor). In case you are wondering, there are restrooms available on both floors (the 15th floor one has three stalls, while the rooftop one is just a room).We walked to the bar and ordered drinks. Dena got a glass of red wine but Joyce and I both got cocktails. She got the Lolita (Fris vodka, St. Germain, grapefruit juice, cucumber, champagne) while I got the Writer's Block (pear vodka, St. Germain, lemon juice, champagne). The drinks were pretty similar and both came recommended by the bartender. I'm not sure which one I prefer; both are light and refreshing without the taste of alcohol being overpowering. I liked both of them, so it's a good thing JQ shared a lot of her drink with me. Thanks JQ!When we got there all the seats were taken so we just stood near the bathroom area so we could put our drinks on the wall, but it didn't take long before a few seats opened up. We quickly walked over and took them... and refused to leave because we didn't want to give them up :P Of course, since we're on the rooftop, it got cold soon, so we had to leave eventually because we were freezing :P But of course I can't end my review without mentioning the view... which is beautiful. It would have been nice to come here around sunset because I'm sure it would have looked even more spectacular then, or at night so I could see all the twinkling lights of dtla, but the view in the late afternoon was still lovely.

I actually think this view sucks and your food sucked too. 3 points only for the awesome DJ (so good!!) and entertainment: hipster watching.Conclusion:I am convinced the owner/planner of this restaurant was 95% concerned with attracting the young twenty something drinking crowd, 4% concerned with butterflies and 1% concerned with the food they would be serving. \u00a0Even when entering the restaurant there is a long line for those that want to enter for the bar/lounge. \u00a0Immediately after seeing that I should have known this place is not for food - its for booze and mingling. \u00a0So all in all great place for drinks (if you're in the area but don't expect much for your palate here, you'll be let down if you do.", "Date": "2014-04-21", "Author_Location": "Beverly Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "Eddie Z.", "ReviewID": "7hM8sJiuI6DLSCWRtbO1fg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first time here and I have to admit I had an awesome experience. \u00a0Staff was great, the food was beyond excellent. \u00a0Everything was tasty and they took orders correctly.

So I'll break up my review into 2 halves.NIGHTLIFE:When I first drove by, I saw a massive line at 10:30pm (or so), and I started freaking out. According to our Korea study abroad reunion plans, we weren't planning on going in until 11:30 or 12ish. Luckily, one of my friends knew the owner/ was a regular patron, so we were able to skip the entire line (with a group of 12, no less!).As this was my first time, I had no idea what to expect. We went up the elevator to a small room, then into another elevator which actually led to perch, and then started taking it all in. It was hard to tell what was exactly going on in the dim lighting, but it seemed like a pretty poppin place. We headed out to the patio area. It was a bit chilly that night (so ladies, def bring a jacket. There's no coat check, but it's worth keeping warm). Drinks are pretty decently priced. Maybe it's cuz I've only been clubbing a lot in DTLA, but I was pleasantly surprised when drinks were like $10 (i.e. 1 Macallan 12, 1 vodka soda with a splash of cranberry, and a beer = $30). This isn't really a dancing spot, more bar/ loungey - lots of people talking and drunkenly making out in the corners haha Regardless pretty cool place. The view is great, venue is classy, a great place to go out!Last call was at 1:40am. This might've been my only point of irritation. Too early.~~~~~BRUNCH/ LUNCH:Luckily, my friend's AirBnB was literally just across the street from Perch, so we eventually got up with a hangover and decided to go to Perch for food (just 2 of us by this point). This was on a Sunday morning/noon.It looks really good in the daylight. Almost everything that was a wall with windows was now open, so there was so much air and natural light flooding into the place. We got pretty lucky and got a seat right away (if you have a bigger party, def get ready to wait). We sat \"inside\" but it was right next to an open door/window, so it was basically like sitting outside but in the shade! yelp.com/biz_photos/perc\u2026Here's what we ordered:- bloody mary: it's pretty big, didn't ask me how spicy I wanted it, but it was still pretty good (not spicy though)- mon petit cheri: my broken French translates this into \"my little friend\" and it comes in a little glass bursting with so many flavors. It's really an interesting drink. There's goose cherry noir, creme yvette, ginger, champagne - I don't even know what those first 2 ingredients are. Not sure if I'd recommend unless you want to try something completely random. It gets stronger as you get to the bottom. yelp.com/biz_photos/perc\u2026- perch burger: to be quite honest, this was like a gourmet IN-N-OUT burger in terms of seasoning and dressing but with a fried egg on it. It was a really messy burger but obviously tasted pretty good. Got it cooked medium rare with a side of fries (you can choose salad if you want). The fries are regular (not sure if you can upgrade to the truffle ones). yelp.com/biz_photos/perc\u2026- #13 benedict: your standard eggs benedict (they have other options as well with salmon or crab). These were ok although they were a bit salty for my taste. These came with a side of house potatoes. yelp.com/biz_photos/perc\u2026Overall, while the service was good, the food tasted ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't really stunning.

A friend had previously recommended Perch to me because of the great views. Previous to coming here for dinner, I skimmed through the yelp reviews for this place and I was a little disappointed. I read a lot of complaints about long lines, bad service, unspectacular views, etc etc. So I went to Perch with lowered expectations and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my dinner!The first thing I noticed upon being there was that everyone was very well dressed. Heels on women, Jackets on men. I felt really underdressed in my sandals and dress from work. We arrived earlier than our reservation time. We checked in and then went and got drinks at the bar on floor 16. I had a Spicy Concombre and it was soooo delicious. I wanted another but our table was ready a full 20 minutes early! While we waited, we found seats in the lounge area right next to the view (which consists mostly of the Deloitte building). Dinner was delicious. I had two glasses of a Napa Valley Pinot noir, the ahi tuna appetizer, and the salmon for my main course. All were absolutely delicious. My friend had the steak and frites and his truffle fries were amazing. We were seated outside and I was pleasantly surprised by the heat lamp placed right behind me! So I enjoyed my dinner, my company, the view, and I wasn't cold! Perfect in my book. I would definitely come back here, maybe for brunch next time. 4 stars and not 5 because this place is expensive.

We had a 12pm reservation and was seated right when we arrived. We sat outside with amazing views of DTLA and even though we were seated around a little corner area we could still hear the jazz. We couldn't see the band though, I'm sure if you come early like right when brunch starts you will have a seat right where the band is, none the less we enjoyed our seats. Our server was very nice. She came over right away and welcomed us and took our drink order. My hunnie had a mimosa and I went with the Mon Petit Cheri. The bartender definitely didn't skimp on the alcohol, it was actually a little too strong for me...I asked for some juice to add to it. It was good but I think I'll stick with a glass of wine or mimosa next time lol. With all my birthday drinking I did the night before I didn't need anything else super strong. For our food we ordered the Huevos Rancheros, french toast with berries and shrimp pasta. The food was absolutely amazing. I really loved the way my eggs were cooked on my dish. They we rent over cooked but just right. The yolk was oozing out on my plate which was the perfect compliment to my huevos rancheros. The salsa and beans were great as well. The french toast was huge, sweet and berries were fresh. My hunnie really loved her pasta as well. The portion was great and pasta was cooked very well. We were able to share the french toast since the portion was so big which was very nice. I think the prices were reasonable as well. Each dish ranged from $10-$25 which was great considering you can enjoy the live jazz on weekends as well. Would I come here again?

With sunshine, plants and nice views of downtown LA, it looked like a promising great brunch time, and it was!

Flat iron steak frites with truffle cheese fries: steak was fairly delicious in medium rare, the cheese fries were very light too, again could have used a bit more flavor, considering it was truffle cheese flavored.Desert:White chocolate bread pudding, with strawberries and blueberries: it was the best among all the dishes we tried, I only indulge in sweets once or twice a week, besides diet reasons, I don't like sweet things too much, glad the pudding wasn't too sweet, it was just right for me! The brunch was pleasant, I had a Bloody Mary with goose in addition to champagne, it was tasty. Our waitress was very friendly and polite, it was very slow from time to time, she appreciated our patience, we just didn't mind taking time to enjoy the sunny weather and the live jazz band music, it was lovely. The tab was $137. I really liked the fun, relaxing and energetic atmosphere of Perch, the food was good but not great, the flavors were lacking, the portions were on the smaller side. The drinks are better than the food in my opinion, and they are reasonable priced from $12-14, I particularly like the Lolita specialty cocktail, strong and refreshing. I'd come back for an early dinner to enjoy the nice patio with views at sunset hours, since it's summer, or just drinks in the afternoon or evening, meals or drinks, or both, it's always good times at Perch for sure! Ps. Public parking across the street, it's $6 flat rate on Saturdays and Sundays.", "Date": "2014-04-07", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "TG G.", "ReviewID": "kI3cJU0Yoorq59uA1GBy_Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "To start off, this place is purely about money from what I could see.Took my girlfriend to this place because of all the recommendations from my friends as well as the high yelp review. Set a reservation about two weeks in advance. Wanted to make the night special for her because we do not go out to fancy places very often. We were on the list and made it past the front doors and up the elevators. When we finally got to the host, the trouble began.1) Once we got to the host and I checked in with her, they said the wait would still be another twenty minutes. This was more of an annoyance, but since we were already there and the restaurant was clearly busy, agreed to wait.2) After about fifteen minutes, we were called. When the reservation was made, specifically told the man to make sure we were not in the middle because my girlfriend gets nervous being in the middle surrounded by people and as close to the side of the balcony as possible for a great view. The accommodations were important for two factors: one, because we both are childhood cancer survivors and feeling comfortable is important for our health and 2) because these instructions were stated in the reservation, which was completely understood. We were seated by the \"reservation manager\" (a strict looking woman that had her hair up in a bun) at a table that was as far away from the balcony as possible without being inside. The table was a small table right next to the doors to the balcony. The music speaker was just about touching our feet and was blasting loud. We could barely hear each other talk.3) When seeing the table, told the \"reservation manager\" of the accommodations that was mentioned when the reservation was made. She told me, that was impossible to seat in a specific seat because that is not how they operate. They seat each costumer when the first seat is open.4) From there, she went on to questioning me about the reservation as if it were an interrogation. \u00a0When did I call? Who did I talk to? Am I sure I remember the call correctly? Felt more like a suspect than a costumer. She also added we had to wait for all the people that did not have reservations to go first if we wanted to wait for a different table.5) Finally, we agreed to sit there and the \"reservation manager\" said if an empty table opens up, she would gladly let us know. 6) Here is the kicker... A empty table did show up and we quickly asked the waitress (who was very sweet) if we could switch tables. She was completely fine with the switch. We never saw that \"reservation manager\" the rest of the night which means, she was not going to even tell us a seat had opened up. The food was good despite the price, but the service was awful.

Came here for Sunday brunch without a reservation. They opened at 11am, my friend and I got there at 10:50. The lady/manager at the front told us that most of the tables were reserved and decided to sit us at a wall table. There were only roughly five tables being occupied and they were all outside. We were the only two inside and she still decided to sit us at the one table that had no view whatsoever. Then a nice curly haired handsome gentleman saw what she did and moved us to a window table... That's sweet of him, but already dropped our mood down a notch... And made the manager look bad. Later she came up to us and said \"so how do you like your window table.\" As if we were privileged to be sitting there. Excuse me miss, your view and restaurant ain't all what it's cracked out to be first off, and secondly... We didn't asked to be moved, we were generously moved. Anywho. --------FOOD---------Crab cake Benedict---- aren't poached eggs suppose to be gooey with yolk... Um way over cooked our eggs- see picture! More like a poached over hard maybe a slight medium egg if you ask me. Truffle fries--- pretty amazing! If you want to go here for the view that's not even a WOW factor then ok, but personally I'd only come here to get the truffle fries with whatever aioli sauce it comes with, it's that good. I think because they drench the fries with cheesy-ness which always makes me happy!French toast---- I think it's cleaver to use croissants instead of sourdough or other breads, which makes it a little crunchy at the ends, but in the middle my toast was a tad soggy. I think because it's a croissant it's kind of hard to judge how long to cook it because obvi the ends are going to crisp up and well instead you get semi memorable French soggy toast. They do not have any specialty coffees, so you can get a coffee, espresso, and pretty much the minimal add ons. Thank God we came here so early because beware people are waiting for hours to get a table, luckily there's a bar with open seating and a full brunch menu as well. Will most likely never be back, except I would like to see the top level----it's a bar/lounge---they don't open that area up until 4pm though. 3 stars- one for our lovely busser who deserves to be a server with his attentiveness, one for the nice curly haired manager who was kind enough to move us, and one for the truffle fries and the mon petit cheri .

I got an 11:30 am reservation, but wanted an 11 am one (when they opened, since we were going to the Laker game at 12:30 pm). The lady calling to confirm said it was okay to come early and they would try to accommodate us. I appreciated that. Also first time here. The building is classic (another word for old lol).

It was barely warm. Disappointing. Baked Brie - \"creamy whole grain mustard aioli & apple-fennel slaw\" now we're talking. Great appetizer. So creamy and with the aioli was really good. The apple-fennel slaw, I didn't care for it, but my wife loved it. All yours my dear. Lol. It's small though, I could have eaten a whole one. Oysters - the best of our meal choices. It came with a \u00a0mignonette and a cocktail sauce. I preferred the cocktail sauce. Baby Beet Salad - \"watercress, goat cheese, tarragon, apple hazelnut vinaigrette\" it was just okay for me. Crab Benedict - \"two poached eggs, two maryland blue crab cakes chive hollandaise sauce, potatoes\" egg was perfect. The crab cakes were okay, maybe a bit more fried crust would have made this a better dish. My issue, after we got the oyster. A couple of minutes later while we were still savoring the oysters and not even half way done, our main courses came. Poor timing. Were we being rushed? The oysters were very good.

I agree with a reviewer about how it felt like they were herding cattle.When we got upstairs, I was able to relax and enjoy the night air. The location and view is nice. One of my favorite things about rooftop bars is the fact that you don't sweat your face off and, if it gets chilly, can count on the alcohol in your belly to warm you up.That's pretty much all I can give this place.

You have to go through 2 elevators get there. Definitely built the anticipation up even more for me. When I arrived, my first immediate thought was, \"Wow, classy.\" Seems more like a date night type place. \u00a0It's very dim lit, and the dress code is dressy. There's a live band on the first deck in the patio area too. The ambiance just really sets the mood. If you bring a girl here and don't score, you fail at life... The rooftop is where its at though! Extremely beautiful view overlooking Downtown LA. My friend and I were discussing how nice it is to see LA from this perspective (Calm, quiet, and peaceful).Drinks at the bar surprisingly weren't too expensive either. I was expecting to shell out a lot more with this place leaning more towards the upscale side. If my memory serves me correctly, I bought 3 amber lagers for only $9.

Elevator was kind of scary to ride in--sort of like the Tower of Terror ride at Disneyland. But we made it up in one piece haha. Place was really hoppin', so if you want to sit and enjoy your drinks, it'd be wise to make a reservation. The ambience here is amazing. There are tables inside, if you want a more dim-lit atmosphere. But it's the outside that really sells the place, where there are tables with heated lamps and live music, that are accented by a rooftop view of the downtown LA cityscape. It's the city at its finest. A Hollywood moment.FOOD AND DRINK (4/5):For a lounge/bar, I was rather impressed. I ordered myself some California Ale, which was a bit on the stronger side, but had a nice wheaty flavor to it.- MAC'N'CHEESE (4.5/5): Rich, but not too heavy. Made with white cheese and had bacon in it.- BRUSSEL SPROUTS (3/5): My table enjoyed it, but I wasn't a fan. I thought they weren't seared enough, and the glaze was a bit too sour.- GNOCCHI (5/5): The gnocchi were cooked to perfection--chewy, but still had a nice potato-y (sorry, I can't find a better word) texture to them. The pesto cream sauce was light, and didn't overpower the dish with garlic or any other notes. One of the best I've had anywhere.OVERALL (4.5/5):The inconvenience to get to Downtown LA is a bit much for me, and the prices are steep. But for the ambience, experience and quality of the fare that you get, I'd say it's worth the occasional splurge. Perfect for impressing that important date. Just be wary of the elevators.

Think Downton Abbey parlor rooms without the stuffy decorum. - Genuinely friendly down-to-earth staff \u00a0- as opposed to the snooty and stiff waitstaff most of us are use to at \"it\" restaurant/bars downtown- Breathtaking views of Downtown L.A.When I went:On a beautiful Saturday afternoon for a leisurely brunchWhat I've had: \u00a0(1) Assorted Breads and MuffinsVerdict ---- Delicious, the scone was one of the best I'd had (moist, not crumbly) and that jam... heavenly! (2) Perch Fromage PlateVerdict ----- Great cheese selection (could have used more substantial portions of the cheese itself) but came with great raisin bread and fig spread... divine combo!(3) The Perch Burger with Side SaladVerdict ------ One of the best burgers I have had in recent memory... seriously. \u00a0Just remising about it now is making my mouth start to water. \u00a0Made with gruyere cheese, a fried egg and garlic aioli.... good god! How can I ever order anything else? The bun was also toasted to perfection. \u00a0Might be the best thing on the menu... I'll probably never find out what to compare it to. (4) Build Your Own BubblyVerdict ------ Name says it all... choose from orange juice or peach puree. I went with the peach, myself. \u00a0Very fresh. Nothing like a great mimosa on a beautiful afternoon.Ambiance:The inside parlor area was just gorgeous. \u00a0Being big into antiques, architecture, attention to detail, and Downton Abbey, what's not to love? Cathedral ceilings, sweeping arches with light pouring in from every window. I very much wanted to collapse into a dusty library chair and savor a good novel.

Plenty of tucked away corners with comfy seating, heat lamps and fire pits to keep folks warm on blustery days (or nights).

Our server was very attentive and down to earth, just my style. \u00a0After the meal, we wandered around admiring everything. We'd heard there was a rooftop bar, but that it was closed until 6pm. \u00a0When asked the hostess (Malia? Melinda?) if it would be possible to go check it out, after getting the green light from her manager (Alex), she was only too willing to give us a private tour! \u00a0Total sweetheart. \u00a0Felt like we got the royal treatment! \u00a0And none of the stuffiness you typically get in downtown. \u00a0All the staff get a big thumbs up.

I always order french toast no matter where I go, and this one is by far one of the better tasting ones. It has a unique fluffy texture to which I cannot describe, so you should just order it and try it yourself!2) Crab benedict: 3/5 This was pretty average for me. The side of potatoes that it came with was soft and well cooked. However, nothing about this dish really wow'd me.3) Salmon benedict: 1/5 if you're craving for salmon, I suggest you go somewhere else. The combination of flavors for this benedict just didn't complement one another. I did not even bother finishing this dish.I'm not originally from LA, so if you're from out of town, I suggest you check this place out! The view is to die for.

There was a bit of a wait to get in, then we went up and up to the 15th (I think?) floor where we stepped into a large lounge that looked like a cross between a mod LA deck and a Prohibition-era speakeasy. There were some tables, couches, a medium-sized bar, and open doorways to the deck, which has an incredible view of the city. We managed to snag seats on some couches, but beware: seating was hard to come by without a reservation at a table.They had some killer-sounding cocktails but I stuck to my budget diet of their lower-end champagne. Prices were average to high, but not outrageous. The service was fine -- nothing bad to report but nothing spectacular either. The crowdedness was definitely wearing on the staff a bit.Before we left we knew we had to go to the actual rooftop. Unfortunately, there was a line to get up there, but it only took 5-10 minutes. Once we were up there it was completely worth it. There is another bar and even more unencumbered views of LA. I highly recommend it for a nice date or swanky evening out with some friends!

When the hostess showed me our table, I asked if we could wait for a different one (I don't like the tables that are really low to the ground; I don't want to hunch over my food!). She said it was no problem and we grabbed a drink while waiting. She sat us at a much better table and I was really pleased with her hostessing.Dinner was fabulous, we had the skewer appetizer (amazing) and I got the steak frites (as did my friend). The truffle fries were DELICIOUS. My one complaint was the cook on the steaks. I asked for mine medium rare, but it came out rare (medium rare should be a little more cooked through but still red; it was just red). My friend asked for medium and his was still very red as well.In all fairness, we could have sent the food back and I bet they'd have cooked the steaks a little longer for us. But the food was still delicious. I also got creme brulee which was fabulous.The biggest bummer for me was that I come on Sunday nights specifically because there's a live band that plays till 10pm. This night, however, one of the neighbors called in a noise complaint and the cops came to tell the band to be quieter! Instead, whoever manages Perch just told them to stop playing completely. I was really disappointed. I'm sure Perch has the proper permits and the noise ordinances don't start till 11pm. I wish they hadn't let the neighbors bully them into making the band stop performing- the band is my favorite part.

I have only been there for brunch and drinks at night. Both times I was not disappointed by the ambiance. The drinks were typical DTLA priced drinks (around $15). Brunch offered several different items. I ordered an omelet. It came with a side salad. The portion was just right. The omelet was standard as was the salad. The service was good but due to high volume, it got difficult to flag down our waitress after our dishes came. TIPS: -Make reservations during peak times to avoid a long wait. Opt for an outside table.-Location can be tricky if it's your first time. Be sure to check with security in the lobby.-\"Bird\" insignia in elevator button marks the first floor rooftop of Perch.

I came with my husband on a Monday night hoping it wouldn't be packed as it would be on weekends. We had an easy transition waiting at the bar to our table. Not too long and the rooftop bar was one of the best things about this place. Really good cocktails and reasonably priced than other restaurants. I actually wished we waited longer for our table so we could stay at the rooftop bar.We got to our table. The seating was great. Next to the balcony with the view of Pershing Square. I see the menu for the first time and there didn't seem much of a list or selections. A little skeptical, I chose the Scallops w lobster -- which our server told us was one of his recommendations, and my husband the steak. The food came a while, and here it is -- it wasn't up to par with the hype. The steak --I've had better, and cheaper. The scallops were cooked perfectly, but it was hard to down with all the salty sauce it's been sitting in --and that's coming from a girl who loves a little more salt than most other people. My husband enjoyed his some cheese aioli fries although I'm not much for soggy fries.Service was ok. I'm not sure who to blame for the server not really hearing our screams across the noise of people chattering and on top of it the music, or if he was just plain inattentive.Overall, I'd come back with girlfriends for drinks, or the husband to enjoy the view.

Usually a hot night or a sunny weekend day. When are the worst times to go to Perch? See previous answers. You'll probably find that everyone in LA has the same idea as you because, sadly, there really aren't very many rooftop bars and restaurants to choose from. So unless you're a small party, coming at an odd hour, or made a reservation, you're probably going to be SOL, hovering around the area until the hostess can seat you. While I normally wouldn't hold it against a place for being busy and in demand, a friend of mine recently took all of these inconveniences into consideration and called ahead to reserve some space for friends for her going away bash on a Sunday afternoon. They told her that she would be fine just coming in and grabbing a table, but then when we arrived, they said it was probably impossible to sit without a reservation! Luckily, they took pity on us and eventually grabbed us a little table area, but it wasn't nearly big enough for the size of the group. I think that if you're going to constantly have a wait for your outside tables you should have a more clear cut system of taking reservations or at least give correct info when people call in to ask. Other than that, Perch was all right with me. The decor is super cute, and like I said you can't beat the view, especially on a clear day. As for the drinks, they're pricey, but expected from a place like this. The food I had bites of, including some potato chips and sliders, weren't all that impressive, but I think their brunch menu is supposed to be much better.

There's a restaurant/bar with outdoor seating on one floor, and an open area/bar on the top floor. It's a different vibe between the two floors, but both are nice.Had food and drinks on the lower level next to a fireplace before going up to the top floor for more drinks. If you're going on a Friday/Saturday night, i would recommend making reservations at the bar.It overlooks Pershing Square which is nice right now because of the winter decorations.

I love the decor; while it is French inspired, it's also got very classic 50's-60's Downtown Los Angeles ambiance to it. All in all, the entire rooftop experience is surreal; it's really the perfect place to have a somewhat casual-classy night with friends.Drink prices are fair and the bartenders are always super nice and have a heavy pour. I like how they change up their craft beer selections from time to time. No Natty Ice here, bros.Food is decent, too. I especially love their burger and fries, among other things. Good luck getting seated here for dinner if you just walk-in, though. Reservations are a must unless you want to take your chances at the free-for-all seating at the lower-level bar.If you're coming here on a Friday or Saturday for the rooftop level, be sure to arrive by 9:30pm or expect a wait. Not only would you have to wait at the ground level, but once you take the elevator up to the \"lower-level bar,\" there's another line to get to the top. I can see why this would piss off some of the other Yelpers here, but I understand why Perch does this. Without these measures, the top level would be overcrowded and ruin the experience. The second \"line\" usually isn't that bad, and it requires some cunning to get into at times, but it's worth it.Lastly, there's no cover charge here, which is a HUGE plus for such a classy establishment in Downtown LA.I'm in love with this place and I will definitely be back again and again.", "Date": "2013-12-12", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Sam N.", "ReviewID": "2_6indy20Wdvi_KwWAx7Tg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I came here and had a great time and an amazing view of Downtown LA!The Drinks are a bit pricey but the crowd is cool, the service is great, and the ambiance is incredible.I really love Perch because if you have read any of my previous reviews, you would know that I recently had a date here in downtown LA and I continued my date here recently.I really enjoyed Perch because it made me realize some important life lessons on my date here that I would have never learned otherwise.

We found fantastic street parking right near the entrance and took the elevator on up. We got seated inside at a table where the chairs were way too low for the table and we swore we looked like midgets. We asked if they had other chairs or seat cushions and the server just looked at us like we were crazy. Ok then, I guess that's a no. So we dealt with it. We started off with a bottle of wine and ahi tuna tartare to start. I started to glance around and check out the surroundings. There were lots of people around the bar and in the restaurant in general. Quite the place to be in LA I suppose with its sorta hipster, sorta Gatsby like decor and atmosphere. My friend order the scallops while I ordered the Steak Frites. The food was decent, but I'll just say this. I've had a way better flat iron for half the price in London. You're definitely paying for atmosphere here. The truffle fries that came with my meal would've been good if they weren't so soggy. Not exactly sure what they did but they must've doused them in truffle oil or something. After dinner, we made our way upstairs to rooftop bar. Now this was a beautiful place to spend a night in LA. It's not really that high but it's still a lovely view of downtown and all of LA's lights.

First was the Pot Au Feu (braised short ribs with polenta, fried red onion, and watercress). It was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic. As tender as my imaginary French lover. Next, we got the Little Bunny Frou Frou (ravioli of rabbit, heirloom carrots, parsnip-brioche crumble, salami). I never found rabbit to have its own distinct taste, so I liken this dish to a more elevated, delicious chicken ravioli. Then, the Pan Roasted Chicken with wild mushroom risotto and jus de poulet. I liked the chicken enough, but the risotto was ah-mazeee.For dessert, our waitress suggested the White Chocolate Bread Pudding and the Pot De Creme. The latter I just found to be a nice but safe way to end a meal. The former is a different story. OH, DAT WHITE CHOCOLATE BREAD PUDDING THO. I normally hate white chocolate, but this bread pudding was an explosion of delight on my taste buds. Everyone at the table was singing it praises. THE SERVICEI'm beating myself up for not remembering our waitress's name, but she was an absolute pleasure. She made excellent recommendations and was as personable as can be. Perch should be very proud to have her on the staff. We all loved her.THE ATMOSPHEREBeautiful. It's romantic without being super obvious, and you feel like you stumbled upon a private party in the middle of the city. I couldn't get enough of the lights and the views. The rooftop slays me. There is also a live band and a lounging area right in front of the band where you can sit and nurse your drinks or dance to the music.

You can see all the buildings and skyline, and at night time the lights make it really nice. Some nights there is a cover fee for entry to the lounge, my guess is usually on the weekends. There is usually a live band/singer and the environment is just relaxing. There are some older single men looking to meet women, there are groups of people coming straight from their jobs presumably in downtown to just grab some drinks, and there are quite a few couples enjoying each other's company. There does seem to be 2 levels of the outdoor lounge, the hostess told us we could only go to the very top, which I have heard is false... because we told her we were not going to eat at the restaurant.

Once before for a friends little get together, which was cool (except for the drunken Korean group that came in wasted at the end, but that's certainly not the restaurant's fault) and then once to have a beautiful dinner date. Officially, it's a 2.5 to me, but I'm rounding down.So why the two stars? Well young grasshopper, let's go down the list why I like and dislike this place.The Good:- The view is spectacular. It's not the tallest building in DTLA, but it's certainly tall enough. As a result, you get a lot of good lights, good views, and when the weather is fine like it was both times I was there, you really do feel like you are Perched on top of DTLA.- The Ambience (when not crowded) is perfect french bistro-y without feeling too hipster-ish. Yes, it's got the hint of hipster to it, but it's either I'm not feeling the effects of them anymore, or it's been dialed back just enough to be fairly quaint and wonderful. This effect however is severely hampered when it's overcrowded. I mean, having people in suits and dressed up looking nice is fine, but see my \"The Bad\" for details on what I'm referencing.- The Food: It's really freaking good. I love it. Came out super quickly too, which was of some comfort - The Cocktails: Also really good. Kind of expensive but considering the rent for the spot, it's understandable. Very well made and balanced - if you're not careful, or otherwise sensitive, you can easily get tipsy here. Signs of good bartenders (who also looked amazing, both the men and ladies).- The Music: They play live music, mostly jazz (from my experience), which is a rarity in DTLA now a days. I mean, the only other place is what, Blue Whale? And bonus here, you get food and drink!The Bad: - Floor Management/Crowd. I have no problem with a place being popular. I have no problem with crowds. I have no problem with lots of stuff. But when I make a reservation, and I show up on time for the reservation, having to wait over an hour before we're seated, and having the bar be super crowded, and otherwise feeling somewhat abandoned by the front desk. I'm not cool with that and that's where a lot of my dislike is stemming from. I understand from a business standpoint you want as many heads in as possible, but I feel that the balance between price per head, and customer satisfaction has been tipped more for the PPH, rather than the satisfaction.To light, in my dining experience here, I checked in, and was told about 45 minutes, and that I would be texted when the table was ready. Checked back at 45 minutes (Hey, cocktails and conversation helped pass the time) and it still wasn't ready. Over an hour later, and based on my own checking back (i.e. the hostess never sent the text) our table was finally ready. Starving, slightly boozed up, and now we can finally order? Massive downvotingAll in all, I like Perch, or rather I really want to like it. I like the vibe at the tables, or outside, or at the bar. However, I dislike it when things don't get started on time, and further when things are followed through, which I think the floor management dropped the ball on, in my opinion. Will I go back? Absolutely, but I won't try for a reservation, unless I hear things have improved.", "Date": "2013-10-10", "Author_Location": "Riverside, CA"}, {"Author": "Daniel B.", "ReviewID": "RNnb5lKnZ_pyfDjJ0neLNg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great view and ambiance.

I want to give them 5 stars so bad but the service is to blame. I first came here for an event put on by my school. We were given free drinks and appetizers and had the top most floor reserved to ourselves. I instantly fell in love with the view, the drinks, and the food.I then decided to spend Halloween here because the theme was Great Gatsby and I just love everything about that. Boy did Perch put on a wonderful show! They had a fire juggler/dancer guy and beautifully dressed girls walking around on stilts! They also had different music on the different levels for a nice variety.I recently came here on a Monday to try out their happy hour. We ordered the nuts, truffle fries, and bruschetta. Everything tasted great except the truffle fries. $5 crafstmen was delish too. Now about the service....but a little background info first. I am picky about service wherever I go because I think it's important to feel that your business is appreciated in a setting like a nice restaurant or bar because quite frankly, it's impossible to find politeness anymore on the streets of Los Angeles. With that said, if I go to a place like Perch (and pay for parking to go there too), and order generously, I expect to be treated nicely. That's all. I'm not talking over-the-top kiss-assy or anything like that. So I guess Perch just falls a little short of my expectations each time I go there. All of the other things I love about Perch definitely make up for my disappointment and I'm hoping this changes when I come here for a full meal and test out their service in that way. At the end of the day, this place is not nearly as bougie as everyone makes it out to be.

Usually everyone slams the place because of some terrible experience (most likely relating to alcohol) but seriously, if you go and enjoy the point of what Perch is about (which is the view of pershing square), I would say it's quite enjoyable. This ain't your place if you're looking to twerk. This is my second time back, the first time I went, no line, shot up the first set of elevators in less than 30 seconds (there's two sets you have to ride in). This time I went back on a weekend and the wait was about a hour (technically longer, but my party held the place in line for us). The place is more casual in general but I do believe there is a dress code (long pants at the minimum), although there were definitely some underdressed people. The overall feel is a dinner setting with an outside area to lounge, sit around and chat. I haven't been up to the very top of perch but from the main room (the area you first enter) and the outdoor area, I would say it's a good place to catch up with old friends due to the acoustic nature of an open window/door lounge. The music isn't top 40 (good DJ by the way when I went....probably underappreciated) and the music isn't blaring loud where you have to raise your voice (which I hate). The crowd has always been a mix (both ethnicity and age) on both times I've gone, which is nice.I would say drinks were appropriately priced. I cannot really rate the food since I've never had any. There is valet parking outside and pershing square has some parking as well.Overall, we had a good time. the outdoor fireplace is pretty sweet too, although its in a corner by itself and usually some party is sitting by the fireplace.

She reappeared with the ability to give us a nice patio seat. Thank you JOY!When we arrived to our new table, \u00a0we were very hungry, but cold at the same time. Thankfully Corey, the restaurant manager, came over to our table to see how his customers are doing...we were doing awesome, except our birthday girl was super cold. I asked if there was a way we could move to the direct corner (best seat table in the patio in my opinion) with the 2 heaters. He immediately made it available for us! How awesome was that?! No hesitation. He just replied, \"let me help you transfer your stuff to the new table.\" Corey took care of all of our needs. Checked on us every so often making sure we are all good. Thank you Corey!As for our server, Ashley was awesome. I especially had a bunch of questions regarding food and drinks. She suggested excellent wine. I loved both the red and white wine she suggested. When it came to desserts, she also suggested the bread pudding for our birthday girl - which was awesome and buttery.

A good light appetizer - but not outstanding.Little bunny frou frou (rabbit ravioloi) - A light portion of ravioli rabbit with carrots, parsnips and diced salami. It was really delicious but the ravioli was much less meaty than I expected. It was very light, but left me feeling hungry for more by the time I was done. Gnocchi: Served with mushrooms, asparagus, mint and sherry wine. Also a light portion, but the gnocchi was made perfectly and had a great flavor to it. Hemingway on the beach cocktail: gin based drink, which is light and dreamy. Bartender recommended this because of my penchant for sweeter drinks. It didn't disappoint!Writers Block: grey goose pear vodka, st. germain, lemon juice and champagne. Also very light, but heavy due to the contents of the drink. Still sweet with hints of fruit. After dinner, we stood in line for half an hour to go to the rooftop. Once we were there, we were pretty disappointed. I think this place has a lot of hype, but it was just a bunch of hipsters standing around and there was not enough seating for anyone.

I enrolled in a French class, started becoming a Paris-St.Germain fan for the sake of learning about Soccer, an palate for Bordeaux wines, French kissing random drunk girls (with their consent of course), fromage, and not bathing for at least a week. So upon my return I did some recon on places where I can take my new-found French friends to when they decide to visit our great city of Los Angeles. I have been looking to make a visit sometime here for quite some time, however I figured the first opportunity was the Thursday night right before Valentine's Day. I had a blind date that evening and decided to have my date meet me at the restaurant. Bar - Like girls always like to do, they like to run late; about 20 minutes late. Word of advice ladies, we don't like that. So I decided to get the party started early at the bar with a Pranqster Belgian; which was $8 bucks. I deducted half a point; because the bartender unfortunately wasn't as helpful as I would like, all I asked what beers they had on tap and he just handed me the drink menu and waited for me to make my decision. Poured the drink, didn't say thanks, just moved on to the next customer. I can understand he was busy, but I guess it wasn't something I expected for a establishment I had high hopes for. My date arrives and is a Cognac drinker, Hennessy and Coke was her choice and I reached for a glass Glen Livet 12 Year on ice. Bill was $30.00. I was down the hole at $40, so far including tip. Wait time - I didn't have reservations, considering it was Pre-Valentines night, my wait was about an hour and a half. Which I don't really think was bad at all. I am reading nightmares that other patrons cried about the wait time, I figured if you are with good company and the drinks are flowing; time flies. We opted to go upstairs to the top roof \u00a0bar which was a little more intimate and had an incredible view. Grabbed another round of drinks; she grabbed another Henn and Coke, I decided to go with their Mojito which rocked. Round knocked me back another $40. I am already down $80 and I haven't ate a single bite yet. Dinner - Received a text from the maitre'd letting me know that my table was ready. Got a great table on the north side of the building with lit candles and right next to side of the building. Amazing view. Got introduced to our waitress who was a total doll and extremely attentive despite being extremely busy that evening. We decided to stick with mainly appetizers since we were probably getting full on liquor. 1.) Baked Brie - $8.00/ I've had Baked Brie at so many restaurants to this point, there wasn't much I felt that made it stood out. Its a simple appetizer and I make it on occasion at home. I guess its just a staple that I have to get every time I go to a French restaurant. 2.) Truffle Poutine - $12.00/ It was great wherever our fries had sauce, but I felt that they kind of skimped on the sauce as we left most to the plate full of fries at the end of the dinner. 3.) Pork Belly - $12.00/ Oh my Gawd, WTF, its as if Angels came down from Heaven and made it themselves. This dish was the belle of the ball. Sure, its probably all fat, but the richness in the sauce makes me smile just thinking about it. I am ordering this again, the next time I come back!!4.) Ahi Tuna Tartar - $16.00/ I always fall for Tartar and they do deliver it here at Perch, sauce wasn't overwhelming or too sweet how you have to put up with an Asian fusion dish. 5.) Bread Pudding for Dinner - $10.00/ White Chocolate Bread Pudding done A la'mode. I don't remember my date eating it because I gave here the Heisman when it arrived on the table. I ordered another night cap to help sober me for my drive home with a bit of Kahlua. The bill came out around $78 after tax and we left our server with a nice tip.Ambience/ Service - \u00a0I love the view of the city and it doesn't get any sexier with a classy dinner if you are hoping to impress your other half. 90% of the staff was awesome and super friendly from the doorman to my server. Other than the bartender at the first bar, who I think may have gotten mugged on the way to work, I can't complain much else about the service. But here is where I deduct the last half star. During that evening, there was a live band outside doing covers on Sade, sexy, I can dig it. Followed by a DJ playing some light house music. This goes to the DJ, how do you go from house to playing Michael Jackson to the Cure followed by Justin Bieber. I get the Michael Jackson, because there are old people that eat there and think they are still cool by slurring the words to PYT. I love the Cure's Lullaby; but why in the World would you go from something great to Bieber and that Baby song. I should have just gone up and round housed the DJ off the 15th floor. I will return, hopefully the DJ hasn't.", "Date": "2014-02-27", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Sayla E.", "ReviewID": "v20pFq-gbDjPUK8YtCVieQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had my Birthday here with 10girls. \u00a0The place is so over rated!!

For first-timers, getting in might be a little confusing. Perch is located on the corner of 5th and Hill and the entrance to get to the elevators is on 5th street. You take the first set of elevator to the top floor, exit and enter another elevator that'll take you to Perch on the 15th floor. There's usually someone there to direct you. Or it's usually so busy you can just follow the crowd.I recently visited Perch for Saturday brunch and was pleasantly surprise at how nice and peaceful it was. I hear it gets busy during brunch, so I guess we came on a good day. There were plenty of tables available, but most of them had a \"reserved\" sign on it... so best bet is to call for reservations first. Also, if you don't want to be directly in the sun, request for a table with shade.I was also surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal. I ordered the baby beet salad, and if you're crazy about beets like I am... order this salad! Portion size seems tiny at first because there's barely any watercress included, but the beets are plentiful and ridiculously delicious. The beets are tossed with diced apples in a yummy vinaigrette and topped with creamy goat cheese. The rest of my group enjoyed their meal as well. The Perch burger is enormous, so a good choice if you've got a bigger appetite. French toast was super buttery, so you know that's gotta taste good too. Overall, great meal and great outdoor brunch environment. $15 bottles of champagne + $5 carafes of juice for mimosas. I personally prefer their Bloody Mary's and highly suggest you order one too.", "Date": "2013-08-15", "Author_Location": "Monterey Park, CA"}, {"Author": "Linna L.", "ReviewID": "9d67g7gTCY9l_R6LkE8DLg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perch is now my favorite roof-top bar in LA.

My friends and I love to dine out at different restaurants in the city, this time we chose your restaurant as also to celebrate my sister's pregnancy. But sadly, our experience was traumatizing, I have never been treated with so much disrespect. We made reservations for six on a Saturday night at 8pm, my friends came in early and 3 of us were running late. Female staff assigned on the ground floor did not want to seat my friends who were there because the party wasn't complete, understood. My friends waited until we arrived at 8:20pm, we went up and the girls at the reception said that they gave away our table, saying it with so much arrogance. We were annoyed at this point. We chose not want to fight or talk back, they told to wait at the bar and once a table has opened up, we will be informed. We didn't want to ruin our night so we waited. 40 minutes later I received a text informing that our table is now ready... One of the male hosts which I failed to get his name (African-American with glasses), led us to our table and so we sat. Two minutes later, he came back and made us stand up again, since that wasn't our table. While, the other group who apparently is assigned on that table we're staring at us. It we're very humiliated! He told us that our table was the one on the far most corner, which is not even a table. It is a sofa, and has a fireplace in the middle and a side table size about 1 foot high! How are we supposed to eat there? He told us in a very condescending tone to accept that table or wait for like 3 hours because we missed our reservations. We left without making a scene because one of us is pregnant and so she needed to eat right away, but we demand an explanation from the male hosts other girls on the reception that was on duty July 13, 2013 between 7pm -9:45pm: 1. Why was our table given away when we were only late for 20 minutes, other people from our party were already there. We looked at other empty reserved tables and asked one of your staff how come other tables were being held for more than one hour? She did not have an answer.2. My friends were there 30 minutes earlier and other staffs from the ground floor did not let them come up because party was incomplete. Understood, the staff from the ground floor knew that the rest of the party was going to show up, why was our still table given away after 20 minutes? We all saw parties being sat down even though party wasn't complete. Again, your staff did not have an answer.3. I hope your staff and management treats everyone the same way, with the same respect they would like given to them. What made them think that we would accept that table which doesn't have an actual table? Did they really think we would eat an $80 meal on our laps or on a table few inches below our laps? We are not desperate individuals.We felt belittled and humiliated by your staffs. We have had excellent dining experiences in top restaurants, such as restaurants of Chef Batali's Osteria Mozza and Otto, Chef's Jose Andres' the Bazaar and Jaleo, Mastro's, Huntley's Penthouse, and Chef's Ramsey's Rooftop, to name a few. Clearly, the hosts, staffs and management at Perch are not at the same level of professionalism as those fine restaurants.

\u00a0There are less expensive spots downtown and more expensive spots. \u00a0Some of the starters are really quite good but some can be a bit pricey.They offer a cheese and cured meat plate appetizer that is made up of two cheeses and two meat selections but at $16 it may be a bit pricey for many.The baked brie is quite good at about half the cost of the cheese and meat plate.One of my friends always gets the mussels. \u00a0I abstain as I do not care for mussels. \u00a0They are more pricey than the meat and cheese plate.The Caesar salad is nicely done. \u00a0It is a good split for two folks. \u00a0Skip the chicken or shrimp options as they do not belong in a classic Caesar salad from \u00a0my point of view.A notable side dish that is hard to pass up is something they call Truffle Poutine. \u00a0French fries, truffle gravy, cheese and bacon. \u00a0I mean really .... full steam ahead ( you can run faster under full steam as your wallet is $12 lighter so you carry less of a load). \u00a0For me it is hard to pass up this item.Winners from the past we have consumed....The herb crusted salmon is great. \u00a0There are also shrimp, roasted peppers and mushrooms.The Bouillabaisse is excellent and another good dish to share if you are trying to keep the calories and $$$ down. \u00a0There are many kinds of shellfish, sausage and more than one type of fish. \u00a0It is excellent.The roasted chicken is good as is the short ribs but I prefer the fish dishes.I generally pass on desserts as my favorite Creme Brulee and Creme Caramel are made by a French fellow who also has a knack for building amazing guitar amplifiers. \u00a0But .... that being said there are a few items here that I love. \u00a0There is an orange creme brulee that is terrific. \u00a0The chocolate pot de creme is a total winner with berries and is as lovely to look at as it is to eat. \u00a0Last on my favorite list is their white chocolate bread pudding with a bourbon caramel crust. \u00a0Heck, I don't even like bread pudding but this one is a winner. \u00a0 I think later this evening that Chocolate Pot De Creme is now on my mind for this evening.I guess that wraps things up.", "Date": "2013-11-04", "Author_Location": "Burbank, CA"}, {"Author": "Arturo M.", "ReviewID": "C2w407de3e0YT2bYBv0XFg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Came here for an anniversary dinner.

I definitely saw the older crowd but not the classiness; I saw guys in sneakers, girls in what appeared to be skimpy clubbing wear (?) and maybe a few casually dressed people. The ambiance is a lot different from clubs, it is more intimate with lights wrapped around the trees, fireplace and music that isn't blasting in your ears. Drinks run around $12, there was a bar inside and one outside on the balcony. The bar at the balcony didn't have much of a line compared to the bar inside. The rooftop also has a bar, but there is only one bartender so expect to wait a while.The place overall is pretty small with a mix of people dining and drinking.

The guy checking ID's was also funny and was very friendly and didn't make things awkward when a homeless man tried to hit on my friend.When we got to the 15th floor, I immediately regretted not making reservations. (Btw, if you have 5+ people in your group, I don't think they take online reservations). Anyway, we decided that we're only getting drinks anyway so we headed to the bar area outside. It was super crowded but the atmosphere was pleasant and didn't seem snooty or pretentious. Also, the drinks were more affordable than other bars I've been to ($25 for a cosmo and a manhattan is not bad). The Cosmo was good and the bartender made it quickly but seemed to pay attention to detail (i.e. the lemon peel decoration etc). Overall, if you're just trying to catch a pretty night view of the Los Angeles skylines, this place is great. If you're coming here specifically for the drinks, you might be slightly let down as the alcohol content in each drink isn't as much as a dive bar would give.

So, I patiently wait, and wait, and wait, while my birthday girl sits alone up stairs. :(35-40 minutes later I finally get in.I take the lovely elevator up and arrive at the 13th floor.Wow , this place is sooo pretty! And its packed. The decor is lovely, the furnishing, everything about this place is classy, except the staff. The balcony and dining area are filled with lovely creatures enjoying their Saturday evening with friends.I call my friend, because I can not find her. Alas, there is a second level that is only accessible by a second set of stairs/elevator. Low and behold, there is a line to go up one more flight of stairs. Sigh, really?So, I ask the security guard, yes, there was a security guard at the end of the \"stairs\" line. Is this the only \u00a0way to the top? He had a major attitude and replies \"YES\" but we are at capacity and I can not have you wait in this line. You need to come back when the line has gone down!I explained I have been waiting downstairs for 35 minutes, its my friends birthday, can I please just wait here so I can join her asap. He said No coldly and told me I should go to the bar :/Oh boy. I go to the bar and find another friend lost in the shuffle, experiencing my same dilemma. We order a drink, and explain to the bartender our situation. She rudely just gave a blank stare and attitude and replies \" How can \"I\" help you?\" (extenuates on the I)I am an LA native, and I am reminded why I hate going to places like this.If it wasn't for my friend waiting upstairs I would have high tailed it out of there.Our group starts growing downstairs as more birthday guests arrive.

They invited us to join them at a birthday party at some rooftop in LA. We accepted and had a blast there with free food, wine, and a bunch of friendly bisexual men. If you're homophobic you didn't belong at this party. Anyways, I had a great time, a night to remember.I also took a \"souvenir\" from the rooftop party. :D PROS:i. Great view of the place. ii. Bouncers, unlike most places, are very welcoming and cordial. iii. A nice date place as it is soothing. iv. Food is delicious. There french fries :Dv. Cuties everywhere.Cons:i. Bartenders don't really know how to make drinks (I asked for a sex on the beach and it turned out to taste more like lemonade).ii. The drinks are expensive. iii. Though a wonderful lounge, the space can be too squeezed in (if you're claustrophobic don't go). Restaurant, lounge, and wannabe dance floor makes it too crowded. Will I take my girlfriend here? Yes.

WAIT: We had dinner reservations so we didn't have to wait in the line (but I hear there is no cover, so around 10 when we came out there was a huge line!)If you try to book it for more than 12 people you will have to go through their event planner so keep that in mind. ATMOSPHERE: They sat us outside right on the edge of the rooftop, which was perfect. \u00a0There are glass/plastic panels that keep you from falling off of the edge but my boyfriend remarked they are a little lower than most places (like elevate) so it didn't cause any problems when taking pictures :PThe seating was kind of weird because they were couches with low tables so eating was a little difficult but most of the other people I saw had regular tables with candles etc. \u00a0The lighting is low with candles, christmas light types strung around and it was a nice warm night in LA.The view was OK, I wasn't super impressed and I think you're only on the 15th floor or something. \u00a0There was a live band playing while we were there though, which was a nice touch.Lots of greenery too.FOOD: I thought the food would be only OK or even bad but what we got was GOOD. \u00a0Sure, they are small but what do you expect for a lounge? Pork belly - it was a substantial piece, and it came on a huge plate even though it only took up 1/4 of it but it was TENDER, FATTY, and TASTY. \u00a0With a bit of a crispy edge.

I don't frequent it as often as I'd like to, but I've had a good time each time I've been. My favorite thing is probably the decor and ambience -- romantic, elegant, very French. Not to mention the beautiful view of the city; definitely one of the nicer views within downtown. The crowd is very diverse, and it can get pretty packed on a weekend night, so getting a table and finding a place to sit can be a hassle. However, for this review, I'd like to focus on Sunday Brunch.In our most recent visit, my boyfriend and I went with our friends to discuss an upcoming weekend getaway. Making reservations via Open Table, we had a table reserved for us. However, your party will only be seated if everyone is present. George W. and I were running late so our friends couldn't be taken to our table, and hung out at the bar while they waited for us. After arriving, we were immediately seated.Our friends ordered an Arugula & Endive salad ($12) and Huevos Rancheros ($16), while George W. and I got the Perch Burger and French Toast. Our group shared Assorted Homemade Breads and Creamy Truffle Cheese Fries. The Perch Burger ($16) was great, consisting of aged ground beef, brioche, shallot, lettuce, gruyere cheese, garlic aioli, and a fried egg. However, the French Toast ($14), served with vermont maple syrup, brown sugar, bacon, and fresh berries, was a little underwhelming. Delicious croissants, a blueberry muffin, and a orange cranberry muffin were included in the plate of assorted breads ($6). The Truffle Cheese Fries ($11) is probably the best thing Perch has to offer -- definitely recommended if you ever visit Perch, day or night.And what's brunch without champagne? Like most of the surrounding tables, we got a bottle of $15 Pol Clement Brut and added a carafe of peach puree for $5. I personally would've preferred orange juice, but I was outnumbered 3:1. We had the recommended Orange Cardamom Creme Brulee ($10) for dessert, and it was terrible. The caramelized top layer was too thick and broke in large pieces, while the custard underneath was practically a liquid. Do not get this!The food at Perch is overpriced for the taste and quality you get, as the majority of the plates were mediocre. If I ever visit for brunch again, I'll only order croissants, truffle cheese fries, and champagne. It's not a lot of food, but for the view and ambience?

You learn to love and appreciate the city lights and what the night life views have to offer here in SoCal. Showed up here a few months ago on a semi early Friday night and had no wait to get in. The place itself is a bit tricky to find since you need to walk into a building and then take the elevator up to the 13th floor and then take another elevator to the 16th floor where to the Perch is.  I truly loved the fact that there was NO COVER CHARGE for this place. As for dress code, pretty much anything flies here. You can be dressed up or casual but don't look like you rolled out of bed. The crowd is pretty mixed, young kids, older professional looking people to even some hipsters. Either way you will not feel out of place. If you are lucky enough, you will find a place to sit and chill while taking in the breathless view of the city otherwise you might be stuck walking around among the crowd with eagle eyes waiting for the next group of people to fly off their table so you can swoop in and take over. The place can get a bit crowded and I would suggest making friends so hopefully you have no trouble finding a spot for you and your friends. This place might not be good for groups unless you make reservations for dinner. Also if you go late or on a busier day you might find yourself having to wait on the long line going out and around the corner to just get in like I found myself just a few weeks ago doing. Unfortunately I did not want to wait an hour just to get it so sadly I walked away.Drinks: *My Fair Lady: - fair quinoa vodka, cranberry, lime, cr\u00e8me de peche $12The drink is well made and it's not strong tasting at all. I had asked the bartender for something with vodka and she suggested this drink to me. She seem to make the drink perfectly in which I was able to get the full flavors of all the ingredients with none being more over powering than the other. This drink was very easy to enjoy and drink for those that aren't into the strong alcohol taste.*French Maid - park vs cognac, lemon, cucumber, mint $12The lemon, cucumber and mint make this a refreshing drink with a nice park vs \u00a0cognac kick sort of like a different version of a mojito. The park vs cognac made this one of the stronger drinks I had without making me feel manly haha. *Lolita - Fris vodka, st germain, grapefruit juice, cucumber, champagne$14Served in a martini glass; this became my favorite drink here. The champagne definitely very delicious when it's mixed with grapefruit juice. A lot of people don't like eating grapefruit because of the bitterness but this drink made it all super delicious They also serve wine, bottle and draught beer.On average you will pay about $12-$15 per cocktail if that is your poison for the night. Do keep it class and not trashy here plus getting trashy will most likely burn a hole in the wallet. The bartenders were all super friendly and happy to suggest/recommend drinks for you based on your taste and cravings for the night.Classy place with a wonderful view that can be chill, romantic/fun and for sure a nice place to catch up with a few friends. The music was good and not loud so it was easy to carry on a conversation. I would love to come back and have dinner here or even brunch as listed on their website.

After 10 PM, a friend who was lagging had to wait about a half hour to come up to meet us on the rooftop.-We had a difficult time locating it from the street as we were driving around. It's a little obscured. There is street parking, valet for $8, or private lot parking in the surrounding areas for various prices.Minus 1 star b/c: we were bummed when we found out we could only eat on the 15th floor, not on the rooftop. We really wanted to try the truffle cheese fries among other things. To eat on the 15th floor, you either have to have reservations or scrounge around for bar seating or these random couches that don't have \"reserved\" signs on them. Another reason for minus 1 star: there was only 1 bathroom for women and 1 for men on the rooftop that we could find. Women were waiting a long time to pee (and that's not good if you've had a few cocktails)!But all in all, I'm glad I came here.

Nice choice, guys. Totally reminded me of the Rooftop Bar at the Standard Hotel, however, MUCH MORE calmer. (love it) So it takes two elevators to get up to the top. I like how there's two bouncer guys stand around at the second flight of elevator just to guide you where the roof is. By the way, listen to them when they say \"press only the bottom button when waiting for the elevator\" because you DO NOT want to set the fire alarm off. (maybe they should do something about that in case someone does get intoxicated and does press it...)As we got upstairs, open seats! Yes, there are two small fire pits and a few chairs and empty tables without chairs where you can use to put your drinks while chit-chatting. We were lucky enough to sit at the rocking chair area. We met a couple of people, and made some small chats. The drinks were $$ but worth it because of the ambiance. Sipping on something you like, enjoying the smooth music and having the people you like around you is the best feeling ever. Get the French Maid drink and make sure you have the lady make it, because she makes it the best. Avoid the African American dude, he made it too sweet and was not worth $12.Left around 10pm and damn there was a hell of a line.

The service was quick and professional, nothing to complain about there. We had the baked brie appetizer, I had the pot-au-feu short ribs and my fiance the chicken supreme, and shared the orange cardamom creme brulee. All were excellent, although there was maybe a slightly heavy hand with the cardamom (I like the flavor, but it drowned out the orange and vanilla a bit). The only misstep was syncing up the drink and food service; I was halfway through my entree before I was offered a new drink (after finishing my cocktail), and the after-dinner drink arrived long after dessert. Also, the spicy jalepeno cocktail is REALLY spicy. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I was expecting a little hum of jalepeno and got a blast of heat (and I'm generally a fan of spicy food). Regardless, very well done overall and we'd definitely go back.Regarding the reviews about people having bad service with groups, this is not a big space, there are very few big tables, I'm honestly surprised they even allow reservations for more than 6 or so.

Not crowded at all and a great place for a date or just hanging out with friends. One of my friends had dinner there earlier and said it was delicious. The worst thing about Perch: Lines. In order to maintain the unsquishy environment in both the 15th floor (restaurant) & especially at the rooftop, you must bypass 2 lines to get there. The 1st line is to make it inside the building to take the 1st elevator to the 13th floor. From the 13th floor, you take another elevator to the 15th floor. If you choose to hang out in the indoor lounge/restaurant, hooray! No more lines for you. But if you prefer to ascend to the 16th floor, another line awaits you. They seem to be pretty strict about it since no one is allowed to the top unless people leave. So if your goal is the rooftop, make sure you are in the SECOND line no later than 10pm.

Some friends surprised me with a dinner here so I was lucky enough to try out the food here!FOOD/DRINKS - 3 Stars: I ordered the steak frites (yelp.com/biz_photos/perc\u2026), which was delicious. I was pretty much starving and I literally ate everything on my plate! The steak was cooked the way I like it... medium. The french fries were thinly cut. The prices were a bit high for what it was, but you're definitely paying for the ambiance and setting. I ordered a couple of drinks with coke and coconut vodka (yelp.com/biz_photos/perc\u2026). These were really good. The food was nothing spectacular though I do have to say I was disappointed with the dessert choices. I expected something a bit more extravagant.SERVICE - 4 Stars: The service here was really good. Our waitress was very friendly and patient with us as we had some people that showed up late. So, she didn't rush us and continued to serve us drinks and appetizers.ATMOSPHERE - 5 Stars: The dining area is really nice and has great views. You can choose to sit inside. There are a few tables along with a bar area as well as couches. You can also sit outside which is covered and in some areas. There are also some fire pits and heaters as well. The decor here is very beautiful in here and yes, very French.BAR AREA - 4 Stars: The bar area is packed with people and you can generally go outside to the terrace/balcony area on the restaurant level and enjoy the views and live music. The live music was awesome and it was lively. I enjoyed the atmosphere though it felt like it was a tad crowded.LOUNGE - 4 Stars: So, the lounge area is fantastic. However, if you get here after 9:30PM, you could be in line on the bottom floor. So, you'll have to wait to enter the building and then probably wait to get into the bar/restaurant area in another elevator, and then wait in the stairwell to go upstairs to the lounge.The lounge has a long wait so I suggest you get there as early as possible. I think at a certain time they start to let most people to the roof. However, my party was in line for about an hour. So, we were in it for the long haul to get to the roof and enjoy ourselves.After finally getting to the roof, there is plenty of space. The bar is front and center with restrooms towards the back side of the bar. There also appeared to be a private party area as well. There are a few heaters and fire pits and of course, there were the amazing views. You have to remember to dress appropriately because it can get a bit cold. However, this place is definitely worth the wait.RECOMMENDATION: Get here by 9PM to ensure you can get to the roof on time or if you're having dinner, make reservations around 6PM to 7PM so you can finish by 9PM to avoid the long long long line. The view is amazing and definitely worth it. However, lucky for us, it start to rain a bit around 1:15PM so most of my party had left since they had to drive back to the OC/West LA. So, the downside is that if it rains, you're a bit SOL. Nonetheless, I will be back here to chill with my friends.

The place was actually fairly easy to find, we mapped it out and found out that there's $6 parking right across from the entrance so that was nice. Walked into the building and the security told us to take this scary broken down elevator to the 13th floor. As we exited another man showed us a better & not broken down elevator to take to the 15th floor.We made our reservations on my iPhone through yelp for 11:15am, we arrived about 10 mins late and had no problems getting seated. The only thing was that we were seated inside in an area where the sun was hitting us really bad so it got way hot! Seeing as it was our first time there I really wanted to be seated outside seeing as most people on the reviews say that's what makes the whole Perch experience. I asked our server (who seemed nice by the way) if we could be seated outside and was told all tables were reserved. After we ate our food, we ran into friends who were seated outside, turns out they called in just that morning, arrived there as they opened and were seated outside. What's the deal?!As for the food and pricing.. It was okay.. I think you're paying more for the ambience or the experience of overlooking Pershing Square/Los Angeles because the view was breath taking! I'm sure it's very beautiful at night as well. We ordered the Cheesy Truffle Fries (About $11), Perch Burger (About $16) and the French Toast (About $14). The Perch Burger was okay, we were starving already so I'm surprised I didn't want to devour that plate, but I would still prefer my In & Out Burger over this. The French Toast was made out of croissants which I was really excited about but.... It was TOO sweet and rich for me, and that's a lot coming from someone who can finish a whole bag of Hershey's Drops on my own in one day! It was okay on it's own, but they also served it with syrup and it just made it taste like you were eating pure sugar. The fruit topping did help a bit, but as much as I love french toast, I only ate like 2-3 bites of my $14 French Toast. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed the truffle fries though, I think it's a must when you go! The top crunchy parts are so delicious but once it gets soggy it starts tasting a bit blah. I was also able to taste their Sangria Pitcher through the friends we ran into, I thought that was okay, I like my sangrias to be fruitier.Went to Perch with the boyfriend hoping that this would be our new Sunday Brunch spot but sadly that hunt is still ongoing!

Thankfully, my friend knew downtown pretty well enough to know that Perch was one such place. The fact that we'd have to take an elevator up to the lounge was pretty cool, instantly brought back memories of Vegas lol while waiting for the second elevator, there was a cool, old-school piano and we were playing it as if no one was there :DOnce we were on the top floor, I was amazed with the room and the patio area in the back. And the view!! I was definitely in love, and this was even before bday shots and stuff! I definitely felt like it was an 'SF meets LA'-type of deal, which for me, is the best of both worlds!A friend of mine got me a bday drink (aww he's so sweet lol), and we went outside to sit on some chairs while admiring the breathtaking view of downtown. My other friends were sitting near a fireplace, which I didn't get to see, but I guess there is a fireplace on the rooftop!I didn't really pay much attention to the crowd around us, but the noise level around us was pretty average. The DJ was in the room so we were able to make conversation in the patio area (this is important to me since one of my pet peeves is attempting to talk over noise, which I cannot do that well and then the other person keeps going 'huh?' and like leaning in awkwardly...ugh :)The drinks were pretty good! Not sure which bday shot my friend got me but it was tropical and pretty to look at. Meanwhile, the cranberry vodka (my fav) my guy friend got me was average (I mean, how different can other cranberry vodkas be from one another? lol).At the end during closing, the bouncers could've been a little more nice and professional, but all in all we had a great time considering it was the last venue we went to for the night.

At 6:10, we were thrown out by a security guard whose asshole must be so tight it looks like a garden gnome's winking eye. Turns out, the roof had been rented for a private party. We had no idea--neither did the guard on the first floor, neither did the kind people who direct you to the right elevators. Neither did the waitress who allowed us to order drinks. Or rather, none of them thought to ask us if we were in the party. We, of course, had no idea--we just came to hang out.We received our drinks, started talking by the fire. At 6:10, the Incredible Hulk took a constipated dump into a cheap and badly tailored black suit and that constipated ill-suited dump walked over to our fire pit. It then told us chidingly we were not with the private party, that we had \"slipped by\" him and staff before they'd realized, and told us to go downstairs. He said \"sorry\" a couple of times, but he was monotoned, programmed, and emotionless probably because of a drunk dad who used to wizz on his head from the time he was 4 until he was 27 years old. There was no \"sorry, our mistake,\" nothing. No \"sorry about that, go ahead and finish your drinks and if you wouldn't mind adjourning downstairs after that, we'd really appreciate it.\" All he said was \"sorry, you have to go\" and we said \"...right now?\" and he said \"uh, yeah\" like we were stupid for assuming anything else. We told him we had no idea there was a party, and he said condescendingly, \"didn't you check the website?\" Which, I don't know about you, is what I always do before going somewhere. I go online and check the website. And then I write a handwritten letter to the establishment respectfully asking if I may attend, if only for a few moments, if I promise to remain invisible to other patrons. I also send a stool sample in good faith. I've never been treated so rudely, especially by a man who's penis probably looks like a baby's belly button. Seriously, this guy reminds me of a shitty second-hand sofa stood upright and then sewn into a cheap Halloween witch cape. Whatever, I'm sure he rocks his back and legs when benching at the gym and is a total wretched phony. So we awkwardly left and went downstairs. We told the host on the floor below what had happened and he was completely unsympathetic, but it makes sense, given that he was thoroughly enjoying his fantasy role as a broadway musical homeless man from the Victorian era, replete with a stupid and crooked top hat.

I prepaid for tickets, and the cost was high--$150 per person. I figured for that price, my NYE had better be awesome. ATMOSPHERE: Perch had three floors. On floor 13, there was a dance floor playing dance remixes of top 40 tunes. It remained mostly empty until after midnight, and that's when the dance party started. On floor 15, there was an outdoor balcony with a NYE ball ready to drop and a big band. The band was great, and they provided the space with a fun 1920s feel. On the roof, there was a cigar rolling station, and it had a beautiful view of downtown. My one complaint about the roof--not enough heat lamps. Overall, the atmosphere was welcoming and fun, and lounge was busy but never uncomfortably crowded. The guests were dressed to the nines and it just seemed like a party full of good looking people. The experience was sold to me as a Great Gatsby party, and that's what I got. EMPLOYEES: Upon arrival, my friends and I were greeted by the welcoming staff. Everyone, from security to the bartenders to the hostess, were friendly and they added to the Great Gatsby experience. COAT CHECK: Was free for NYE and that was a nice touch.DRINKS AND FOOD: The ticket price included an open bar and free appetizers all night. Each floor had its own bar, so one never had to wait to get a drink. There were also servers walking around with champagne so that was great. Each floor also had its own appetizers, and everything tasted good. There were cupcakes, ravioli, mini hot dogs, noodles, tortellini, etc, After midnight, however, they stopped bringing out new food items, and my friends and I were bummed. After drinking most of the night, that was when we were most hungry! \u00a0ALL IN ALL: The night wasn't perfect, but my friends and I had a great time.

Still not a fan though.So I got there around 10 or 11. Had to wait in the freezing cold outside to ride the elevator that takes you to the top. Wasn't troubled by this, because it's typical to wait in a line outside a bar. Once we got in, OH DEAR LORD it was so crowded. People were still eating at the tables, others were standing around. Many people were still walking around trying to search for an empty spot.So. My bad experience.My friends were on the upper deck, so my boyfriend and I were scrambling around trying to find a way to get to the top. Apparently you have to wait in another line to get to the upper deck. And this line was huge. So we wait in line, and a security guard comes and tells us that we're blocking a walkway. He told us to wait a little bit until the line dies down, and then we can get back in line once it's out of the walkway. We said ok, and decided to go get a drink. We were at the bar for about 15 minutes, and decided to go back in line because our friends were waiting for us. We get back in line, which is still long BUT we noticed there were different people waiting in line than from 15 min ago. So that means the line was dying pretty fast and the security guard was letting people in. The line was still long, but we were thinking the security guard would be nicer since he saw that we moved 15 minutes ago. NOPE. The same security guard told us that we needed to get out of the way. I told him we got out of the way 15 minutes ago, and no matter what people would be standing in the walkway. But he didn't care, and he just kept telling us to move. So we got a little bit out of the way, standing next to the line and waiting for it to die down. FUNNY THING IS, this security guard was letting groups of girls stand in line even if they were in the walkway. This made me angry, so I just stood in line. I guess the guy saw that I was pissed and let us stand in line. After this 30 minute debacle, my friends decided to just come down and meet us. -___- This ALMOST ruined my night.We went out into the patio, which is decorated really nicely. They put some pretty lights on their trees, and the view of course is amazing. I got a drink for my friend's birthday, and it had a lot of alcohol in it. This is good price-wise, but my friend couldn't enjoy the drink at all. It took a lot of convincing on my part to make her drink it. Lol. My boyfriend just got a couple beers the whole night. My friends had dinner here, but they didn't really have anything good to say about the drinks.Next time, if I ever come back, I'm going straight to the patio. I am definitely not waiting in line for that stupid upper deck anymore. I don't care how much better the view is up there.

My sister made reservations for Perch for her birthday and when we got there at 10pm, the line to get in was out of the door. Because we had reservations, we were able to pass the line and walk right in. The ambiance of the lobby was divine as was the waiting area between the elevators (there are two you have to take to get to the 13th floor and the 15th floor) I don't know what is in between all those floors, and I didn't have time to wonder. Once we arrived to the restaurant floor on the 15th floor, we were greeted by a lovely hosted and seated by a well-dressed Ma\u00eetre 'D. The space was a bit tight; however, we were comfortable. The view was nice and the food was very good quality- although I was expecting gold specs in the mac and cheese. I did try the Writer's Block and the drink was delicious, although small- I almost wished I ordered the bigger drinks for the same price. We did not know that appetizers such as sliders were available- that was our fault because the website clearly says the menu changes for happy hour. The only damper on our evening was one of the bussers and the Ma\u00eetre D were discussing a matter and a glass broke nearby one of my friends. A shard of glass got in her shoe and she fished it out and was concerned that her foot may still have glass in it that she is not able to see. The busser immediately went to get management and also get my friend a clean wet towel to ensure she got the glass out of her foot. My friend expressed her concern to the first manager who immediately went to get Tony- I assume the general manager- and Tony came to our table twice concerned for the welfare of my friend. He assured her that if anything wrong occurred with her foot after she left the restaurant that she could call him and as an attempt to show good will, he took us up to the rooftop bar. By this time the line to get to the rooftop was rather long and several people were waiting, and Tony made sure we got past the bouncers and onto the rooftop. The rooftop was nice with fire pits and lounge chairs and we stayed a bit to drink in the scenery. Since the rooftop music was a bit more on the trendy hipster side (we are more of a neo soul crowd) we didn't stay more than an hour; however, the experience was unforgettable.

The rooftop bar is spacious and the view is beautiful. It overlooks Pershing Square. There is also no cover.

We were a huge kind of complicated (rarely quiet with tons of questions) party and they handled us with grace the whole night.Restaurant: If you cannot handle another line, you can chill here.

The view was amazing, but it took about 20 minutes to order our food and drinks. \u00a0Our drinks arrived promptly, but after another 40 minutes we were really confused why it would take so long to prepare food for a party of 2. We asked the waitress and about 10 minutes later she came back and informed us she had forgot to put our order in, she apologized and brought out 2 drinks on the house. We were annoyed, but people make mistakes so we patiently waited for our food. \u00a0Another 40 minutes passed and they FINALLY brought out our food... Wait not what we had ordered, but maybe someone else's meal? They brought me a small green salad when I had ordered the linguini, and my friend a swordfish- and he hates fish!Now we were pissed! The manager took about 15 minutes to come and speak to us and said 'I'm sorry, this is really unfortunate, but our kitchen is now closed'. I really thought this was a joke- I mean did we really just sit here for over 2 hours for you to tell me you're kitchen is closed?So we ended up leaving hungry and mad. This took the prize for the worst experience I have EVER had at any restaurant. Fine dining at it's worst.So they decided to give me and my friend a $150 voucher to come back and have dinner again. \u00a0I'm changing my review from 1 to 3 stars because...1. They seem to care about their guests. 2. Our waitress the second time around was great, attentive, brought our food out quickly, and pleasant. 3. They didn't have the drink I wanted, said that they were out of the ingredients?4.

Although the view was nice, I thought it was too crowded. We just spent a few minutes up there for heading back down. Got a couple of drinks, but didn't really taste strong. Tasted more of the juice then the alcohol. Finally got seated in a secluded section, which was good and bad. Good because it was private for our people...bad because service was really non extinct.

So, they moved us to the outside; which was fine and the table was bigger but the seating was so uncomfortable. Again, with the patio furniture, I don't get it. If we were going to do drinks then it makes sense but how do you expect 6 people to sit on a wicker bench and cut their steaks?Ok, so on to the food. It was good food. We tried the swordfish, steak frites, filet mignon and ribeye. The drinks were reasonably priced and so were the appitizers, We had the mac and cheese and the lamb sliders; which were very good. Overall, the \u00a0experience was nice, but if I'm going to pay $130.00 for 2 people then I at least want to be comfortable where I'm sitting. And who knows maybe they do that to help the turnover.

We had arrived at the joint a bit early so we were told that we could sit at the bar or go up to the rooftop bars. We decided to check out the rooftop bar. Not disappointed by any means. The view is great on the roof and the environment is super chill and relaxed as opposed to the stuffy ostentatious typical LA bar scene. Ordered a few drinks and they were definitely strong but on the pricey end. It is also cold on the rooftop even with the heaters they had working so make sure to bring a jacket if you plan on standing outside for a while.Now I wish I had stopped with the bar experience but we had our dinner so I have to share the experience. Again we were brought to the balcony side and the view was magnificent. We ordered the bacon mac and cheese along with the truffle fries steak frites. The food was just Ok in my personal opinion.

Because of the reputation and the reviews ive read and heard, i wanted to celebrate our anniversary here. I have no problems with the food and the venue. The food was delicious, hands down. However the waitress we had left me no choice but to rate this place 1 star. If it had been a more interested waitress and enthusiastic with her job i wouldve easily rated this place a 5. The waitress shall remain anonymous. To start off, after being seated we waited almost 20 minutes to be greeted by a server. And as she introduced herself, her saying \"i guess ill be your waitress\" made us feel very unwelcomed. She had a flat affect, and overall impression was very uninterested with us. As we had questions with the menu she didnt really provide us much information besides what is said on the menu. I understand that it is a very busy place but the fact that she couldnt for a quick second check in on us to see how we were doing except to pick up our empty drinks and ask if we wanted more i felt was unacceptable with no concern for her customers. I dont expect too much attention from our waitress.. But just enough to make us feel welcomed. Unfortunately that wasnt the case. And at the end, i wanted to take a picture with my girlfriend with a picture of the view so we can remember this anniversary... So we asked her to take a photo and she gave us this look that she didnt want to and took a few photos which ended up dark! By the time we realized the photos were dark she completely vanished and showed up almost 15 minutes with the check. She approached us with our check with a very uninterested manner and at this point it was clear we felt very unwelcomed.What im trying to say is: Perch is a really great place to have dinner. Great venue and great food. However, if you have this waitress... You may have a very horrid experience. Im willing to come back to give this place another try bc this is a really great place with great food but if i have that same waitress again, im going to make it known and request another waitress.

Are you kidding me? Please don't ever say that to a paying costumer that they are any less important to the owner's people! That was a dumb move.

Yes, Perch was brought to you by the people who started the Must, but the Must girls moved on and so did a sense of hospitality, it seems--at least by a handful of folks who work there. It's a shame because they kind of ruined what could have otherwise been a great night. I arrived on time for my table, but my friend didn't. Didn't matter much because our table wasn't ready. Fine. No problem. I'll just wait at the bar. \"Great, we'll come and get you when your table is ready.\" That's where our fun begins, folks. Seems like my party of one kinda overwhelmed the bar staff because, even though three of them had plenty of time to gossip about patrons and other staff, they didn't have time to help me out. I get it: You're busy. That happens. But I'd say that at any reasonable bar they at least acknowledge you, tell you it'll be a minute, or--if they're not on duty--tap the shoulder of a fellow bartender. I was freakin' invisible. AND THIRSTY. And bored. After waiting patiently for a FULL 12 minutes to be in the rotation (I timed that whizz), I pipped up. I got a flick of an eye from one tender, and was promptly ignored. I will say there was one fun read-headed bartender that was working her tail off at the other end of the bar. I wished I'd sat in Red's section, but instead I was stuck with three idiots who were so busy talking about themselves they couldn't get me a damn water. After a few more minutes, the guy whose eye I caught tapped the shoulder of an unworthy ice princess, (tall, skinny, model-reject with a scowl that's going to freeze that way) who sauntered her way over. Clearly I was bothering her daydreams of an acting career failed, because it took her 20 minutes to make my stupid drink. Honey, you're not the Auguste Rodin of mixology. Don't act like you are and don't take all night to make your masterpiece when it's a two-liquor drink that's on the menu.When I finally got my (too sweet) drink, my friend had arrived and we decided to check in on our table. Sadly, the dizzy hostess I first checked in with completely forgot about me and gave away our table. \"I thought you left.\" I was waiting at the bar like I told you I would, darling. Now did you go off and spend all of your I.Q. points at Sephora? Then, with a long-overdue eye roll, stepped our savior. He's the adorable maitre d: \u00a0Short, black, dapper, and wears fantastic specs. He promptly cleaned things up, got us a table... then stepped over a few minutes later to ask us if we'd like to move, because the best seat in the house had just opened up. You kinda get the impression this guy is the unofficial \"cleanup\" guy, who bitch slaps the other idiots in the back. I hope he takes the bar tending Anne Boylen out back and gives her a good beheading. From then on, our night went well. Our waitress was DELIGHTFUL. The food was decent: I got a fish that was nice (while nothing spectacular), while my friend got an amazing pork-belly special. The chef really needs to give a tutorial to some other LA joints, because the pork belly was kinda perfection This was my third time at Perch and I'd recommend always getting a special. I feel like their on-menu items are always *good* but nothing I crave, but the chef really comes alive with his or her specials. After dinner we had originally planned to go to the rooftop bar, and our waitress urged us to do so. In the end, however, we decided to end the night on a high note by psychically telling the bartenders (minus the cool redhead) sayonara. You don't want to serve me? I don't want your mediocre drinks anyway. Don't you know the Varnish is a quick walk down the street? You might want to think about that and step things up.

They didn't have that many options but each salad sounded soo amazing that it was really hard to choose which one I really really wanted to grub on. I ordered the Baby mixed green salad which was $11.00. The salad price wasn't at all bad the the portion was just right for me. I can see it being a little bit small for others so be careful if you are starving then I would not recommend just eating a salad. The baby mixed green salad came with pears, candied walnuts, red onions, maytag blue and balsamic vinaigrette. If you don't really like a lot of dressing on your salads I would let your server know to put it on the side for an even more healthier option. The service was very quick once we ordered our food didn't take that long to get onto our table. I enjoyed the salad I had and my friend enjoyed the chicken.

Finally got to the front of the line and one of my friends friend tried to work his magic by tipping the bouncer $100 to get a group of us in on the spot..and even then we STILL had to wait for another 15 mins and split the group up because the rule is they can't let anyone up unless people leave. They take their max capacity here very seriously. We finally make it in to their dinner/bar area to my surprise isn't even the rooftop, you have to wait in ANOTHER LINE just to get up there -___- and again, the same concept, they won't let anyone up, unless people come down. Waited probably another 15-20 mins on the fucking staircases with absolutely NO air running through that area and basically sweating our faces off!

Cute/classy setting, mellow music, and drinks were ok; bartender makes a mean Lemon Drop Martini (def recommended). Overall, was it worth the wait? not really.

After so much hype and talk about (due to the reviews) I was pumped \u00a0up to have a great dining experience.I have to comment that the view of the city is really what you're paying for. It was beautiful and especially on a nice sunny day like yesterday, you could see for miles. There's no place like LA. Anyway, we were seated outside and a gentleman brought us water, like most places do.We sat around for about 20 minutes without any server coming to see if we wanted appetizers, tea or coffee, etc. Being hungry, and could no longer wait around, going unnoticed, I personally had to flag someone down to even get our server. Apparently we weren't in their \"station,\" so we had to wait for the server in ours. After receiving our appetizer, we asked to be moved indoors because the wind was picking up and we were getting chilly. That was no problem, then when we were seated inside we got our entrees, but our server was no where to be seen. It felt like she was MIA. During our entire dining experience, we probably saw our server 3 times - 2 of which I had to flag her down. With service this poor, my friend and I even contemplated about leaving without paying, just to see if our server would notice we were gone. Obviously we did not do that, but the tip definitely reflected the service that was provided.Like I said before, I have read so many reviews on this place about the atmosphere and really wanted to like this place. I think the best part of it was the view and I'm sure it would be even better at night. Honestly though, it was just plain bad.

Ambiance : definitely a hit, the interior is really nice, filled with tables, couches, pictures of famous French people, and of course the outside patios offer an amazing view of downtown LA. The only thing I would say is that they sat us ( party of 10) at a table that was obviously too small for our party. So it was a bit tight and an awkward seating arrangement. Probably not a good place for a large dinner group. Most of the tables seemed more for 2-4 people, so that seems like the best size if you are gonna sit down and eat. Service: again, no problem here. All of our waiters were kind and friendly, though a bit clumsy. They knocked over the little lamps on our tables ( with actual burning candles ) over twice and dropped numerous knives and forks several times. However, I think this had more to do with the awkward and tight seating that I mentioned previously. Food: hit and miss. I tried some of the ahi tuna tartare, the Mac and cheese, shortrib, steak and fries, and bouillabaisse. As well as the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and a pudding for desert. My short rib was amazing, very tender and juicy and extremely flavorful. The bouillabaisse was solid and the steak and fries got positive remarks from my friends. However, the tartare was not so great, I love tuna tartare and there was just something off about the one here. The Mac and cheese, maybe due to the bacon fat or something, was just not good. I love bacon everything but I think it just maybe was too much in this Mac and cheese, it was just too greasy. The deserts were just terrible. The bread pudding was just awful.Drinks: Their wine and beer menus leaves much to be desired. Though I love the inclusion of La Goudale (vive le nord!), their beer selection and the prices attached to them is a joke. The few different cocktails that we tried were good, namely writers block.Overall I give it three stars since this place is definitely somewhere to visit, though definitely go with a not too large group and maybe skip dinner and just drinks and snacks.

Still the thought of soaking in the glorious LA weather on a rooftop while sating Sunday morning gastronomic cravings and bragging about it on social media -- irresistible to any Asian scenester. The oysters were fresh and 3 types available. They were just fine. None were briny. A smidgen under $3/each if you order a half dozen.The mushroom spinach omelet was decent. I like Urth Cafe versions better at about the same price. The accompanying potatoes were forgettable.Crab cakes. Expensive at $22, you'd expect to enjoy these. Nope. They were moist hush puppies and bland. Filler to crab meat ratio was in con territory. My chef friend noted the hollandaise was improperly prepared via Facebook.They had a lot of waitstaff on hand to deliver food, bus used plates, reposition sun shades, and top off champagne and water glasses. My waitress was always in a rush to dash off from our table before I could finish my requests.The two seat chairs & tables are small and cramped. Better to come with a group of 3 or 4 and get a larger seating arrangement for comfort sake.The high maintenance palate crowd would understandably give it a low rating.

I parked in the $6 lot across the street, which is a great deal for DTLA. Plus, I got to park my own car. I really don't like valet. There was a long line to get in at around 11, and a shorter line for downtown locals (although I'm not sure how you prove that.... just about everyone I know has an address on their ID that's different from where they actually live). It moved fairly quickly and I took an elevator up to the 13th floor, then one to the 15th. No cover charge, what what!Perch is one of the most beautiful spaces in the city. I never understood why LA doesn't have more rooftop bars; in SD they seem to be everywhere. Perch consists of the top 2 floors of the building. Incredible views of the city, fire pits, comfortable cushioned benches, potted trees with lights.... I loved it all. Although there are heat lamps, ladies may want to bring sweaters anyway because they're a little spread out. It's a diverse crowd, which also goes for attire. My friend told me to wear \"club clothes,\" but I saw everything from jeans to ho dresses. I chatted with a lot of new people and saw people on dates, people who came to pick up on girls, people in groups of friends.... it's just a great place for anyone. I could see myself coming here often if I lived downtown. The ONLY reason I'm knocking a star off is because of the expensive drinks and the lines.... one to get in the building, and one to get from the 15th to the 16th floor, when the 16th floor obviously had plenty of space, and no reason for a line. There are 2 bars on the lower floor and 1 on the upper, which is nice. Drinks are around $14 each, but this is downtown. I tasted my friend's Moscow Mule variation, which was smooth and delicious. We both agreed it tasted a little like lychee but less sweet, and was also very deceiving. I asked for a Long Island (my usual) but was told they didn't have any, which was weird considering it was a full bar.Me: \"So since you don't have those, do you offer something that's equally strong and equally delicious?\" (It had been a long, rough, day, don't judge me).Bartender with an awesome mustache: \"I can make ANYTHING strong.\"Me: \"Anything, is that right?\"Bartender: \"Of course. Try me.\" Hands me the menu.I picked Perch's variation of a Manhattan, and sipped it the rest of the night. One drink. Fast forward to closing time, and I ended up sitting in my car alone after the bar closed, singing, and sending text messages I shouldn't send, until I could drive home.

No, I'm not talking about celebrities with big butts. I'm talking about the fact that we have several ways to impress our dates. We have restaurants with views of the ocean, views of the mountains, and even views of downtown skyscrapers. Not too many cities can boast all of that. One will instantly feel apart of the Cosmopolitan Downtown Elite when stepping foot into Perch. This begins with the fact that you have to actually take two elevators to reach the 13th floor (note: most older downtown buildings don't have 13th floors due to superstition). You either feel like Maxwell Smart on a secret spy mission or simply nauseated if you don't like elevators. Regardless, you arrive to a rooftop restaurant/bar which resembles the lobby of Union Station with couches, desks, dark wood accents and high ceilings. Take a step outside and you will be wow'ed by the setting sun, glittering lights of skyscrapers, and the outlines of tiny people below. You can't pretend it isn't beautiful.Our reservations were met with no problem and we received the prime table by the fireplace (as the birthday girl, I was happy about this). After some photos (it is necessary with such a view) and after my boyfriend had secret talks with the staff about my dessert celebration; I ordered a glass of Pol Clement Brut champagne ($8) while my boyfriend ordered a Kronenburg 1664 beer ($7). As I sipped on my champagne, which was very crisp and tasty, we ordered the Shake & Bake Drumsticks (Frogs Legs w/ lily root & garlic chips and a calvados honey glaze -- $10). I have always enjoyed frog legs and these were excellent. The highlight of frog legs is the flavor combination of chicken wings with a light fish flavor and texture mixed in. Perch's frog legs were crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and with just the right touch of spices. The garlic chips and lily root were not only pretty esthetically, but also complemented the frog. For my meal, I ordered Boeuf Bourguignon D\u00e9construit (Braised Short Rib, thumb nail carrots, pork belly, candied garlic, and potato --- $29) while my boyfriend ordered the Perch au Noisette (Perch saut\u00e9ed in butter and served on a tomato carpaccio w/ peas, leeks, and in a Bouillabaisse sauce --- $28). Service was speedy and our food arrived rather quickly. I was instantly gratified with the beauty on my plate. However, my tongue was not as I took a bite and found my food to be cold. I wasn't going to say anything but hey, we're paying hard earned cash for this, so I politely told the waitress the issue. She apologized and assured me another plate would be out asap. As I waited, my boyfriend ate his perch (I told him it was okay so don't frown about his manners!) which was buttery soft with a lovely seared skin. He was worried about the bouillabaisee but it wasn't overpowering and served the fish well.My heat-updated plate arrived and this time it was perfect. The short rib was cooked just right with the perfect ratio of juices running onto the plate but saucy exterior. The thumb carrots were not only adorable, but had a delectable glazed flavor while the potato (one small sliver) tasted like it was out of a slow cooker pot roast. The pork belly was a bit too soft for my liking but still had a lovely flavor and would satisfy the lovers of the latest pork trend product. A delicious meal which was actually even more delicious the next day as leftovers. Although I think Perch's menu is somewhat (okay, a lot) limited; it's elegance and yet non-stuffy atmosphere with amazing views is a perfect spot for a birthday dinner or simply to impress your next date.

You keep getting better. Had dinner there for the first time tonight, and tried almost half of the menu - was absolutely floored by some of the dishes. French inspired but entirely innovative; the dishes were all modern takes on French classics. The service was excellent - far, far better than my first visit (so I imagine that the service will only get better!) The only low point was...the napkins. No black napkin option for our black dressed and black suited crowd, so lint garnished all of our clothing as we walked out the door. But, a small price to pay for the wonderful experience that we had.The proportions were EXCELLENT. For three of us, we had seven dishes altogether, and didn't feel the need to roll home. 4 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert made for a delicious, satisfying, but not overwhelmingly filling meal. NOT SO FRENCH ONION SOUP. Very good. Caramelized onions! Grilled bacon! Everything you could ever want in a soup. Could have been executed a little better - was a tad watery.CORDON BLEU POPPERS. I've never been a huge cordon bleu fan - always found it a little gross, but THIS. The best version of it I've had. The combination of swiss cheese with candied tomato...it exploded in your mouth (get your mind out of the gutter.) - 4 piece appetizerDUCK, DUCK, GOOSE. Um. Obsessed. I mean, I just love duck so much, but those TOMATOES again, those beautiful sweet tomatoes were such a nice add on to this little 'duck sammy.' The bread itself was also sweet, and great with the duck, but a teensy bit crumbly and difficult to eat. I still loved it. (3 piece appetizer)SHAKE AND BAKE DRUMSTICKS. I've never had frog legs before, so I've got no frame of reference here, but I loved these. The honey glaze they were served with complemented these buttermilk fried legs so well, and before we knew it, all six had disappeared. (6 piece appetizer)THE PERCH FILET. So apparently there is a fish called a perch! I'd never eaten it before, but I hope to eat it for every meal from here on out. Cooked to perfection, the fish was broiled, flaky, light, but extremely moist. Very well seasoned, and atop some very thinly sliced tomatoes drizzled in an olive oil based sauce. They came with gorgeous potato puree, and the combination of ingredients (there were many more vegetables on the plate) was delightful. I'll definitely go back for this single entree. COQ AU VIN. Interesting twist on coq au vin! Again, there were many components on the plate, but they all came together quite beautifully. Fried chicken oysters, chanterelle mushrooms, cipollini onions (my bf knows how obsessed I am with cipollini onions done right!). I loved the dish, but not nearly as much as I loved the fish.BEIGNETS. Yum. I loved them because they weren't overly sweet, but matched with strawberry jam and this AMAZING ESPRESSO WHIPPED CREAM. The whipped cream really captured the essence of espresso, and when matched with the beignets...I was so into it. The menu was far less expensive than I expected. The most expensive dish we ordered was $19 (for the coq au vin) and the least expensive was the onion soup at $9. All in all, a meal for 3 cost $150 for 2 bottles of wine, and 7 dishes. (And I'm so full! Normally I would've eaten far less, but hey, gotta take advantage of my parents passing through.) I didn't view it as classic French fare, so perhaps I had a better experience than those who were expecting as such. I thought the dishes were creative, and complicated, yet the ingredients all came together. The service was near perfect tonight, and still, I imagine they'll improve further over time!

Unfortunately we had no reservations but we were still seated. If I had to describe this place it would most easily be meet with the words a \"secret hiding spot\" but come around 1130pm everyone seems to know of this place and we were left to not feel so special after all. But at any rate make reservations especially on a weekend. I liked that it had sort of a speakeasy vibe to it upon entering the building. There are no massive signs out front which tell you that PERCH is here! No, just a simple address and a vallet out front which is worth the $8 for parking with them. You enter two different elevators where you are finally lead into the restaurant itself. The place was busy extremely busy with dinning guest but latter in the evening people were flooding in at the bar so it became a scene after a while.Jennifer the bartender is hands down the best. She is amongst one of my favorite bartenders now. If you fancy crafted cocktails and not some run of the mill Makers and Coke then you will be satisfied here. I had a few \"Le Libertine's\" then I left it to Jennifer who asked what I liked and she came up with something that was good. I wasn't however feeling so good the morning after. I sipped a bit of the French Maid that a friend had.. Now dinner, because we really came to eat and not only to drink. So, we split an order of the Frog Legs.. I tried it and that's about as much as I can say. They were different, especially in texture so ya, they were good if you like frog legs. \u00a0My entree was the Caviar Salmon and my friend had the Fillet Beef. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING.

This is a bar with some bistro food, with a nice view and, occasionally, a raucous band (worthy of headlining a show at the Grove). If you come here for a nice dinner, like we did -you WILL be disappointed - NO - You will be INFURIATED :-0As we enter, we get carded by a bouncer - frustrated that no one responds to him on their way out when he says to have a goodnight. Someone even sarcastically says \"it was the best -ever!\" we thought he was just being a dick. Nope his sarcasm was spot on.We make it upstairs, gorgeous views. We're seated at a table that's pretty close to another large loud table. We think about moving then realize all the tables are really crowded together.I look at the menu and notice it's not exactly the same as the online menu. E.g. The beef bourguignon is now a beef pot Au feu and the coq au vin bites are nowhere to be found \u00a0We're given a plate of three small French rolls. Not warm, not soft. Not good.Our waiter comes over quickly, very insistent on taking our orders. Sounds good but we only know we want kir royals and mussels to start. He brings the drinks and asks if we're ready to order. We get the heirloom tomato and beet salad, french onion soup, fried Brie sticks and the beef pot Au feu. We mentioned we were going to split it all and asked if it was enough and he said we'd probably want more but this will do for now.I go to the bathroom and when I return the food was already at our table. Not just the apps - all of it. But no mussels. You'd think the mussels would be there too since we ordered them first. Why would they serve us EVERYTHING at once? In a restaurant that's outside? The food is going to get cold. What are they thinking? It settles in- this nice romantic pre-valentines day dinner that we were hoping for is now us rushing to eat all this food before it gets cold while some band you'd find at an Airport Ramada Inn is wailing guitar solos to a bizarre rendition of Que Sera Sera. Ironic? Who cares.The Brie sticks weren't sticks. They were hunks fried and served with some bad raspberry sauce that made the food taste sweeter than saccharine. Awful.The heirloom tomato salad was fine. I've had better... At Trader Joes.French onion soup was probably one of the highlights. Mostly because it remained hot throughout the meal.Beef pot Au feu was also pretty good but the meat was a little dry. And there wasn't enough sauce. There was a nice pur\u00e9ed whatever and some onion crisps - oh look here come the mussels.Yes, the mussels came after EVERYTHING else. Our waiter asked if everything was ok - the bread plate was still hogging table real estate, we weren't given new plates for the entrees (because they came out at the same time). We had to ask for someone to bring our waiter so we could ask him to take away plates (since every employee that passed neglected to notice ) and give us new silverware.After tasting the appetizers and the beef that we were nervous would grow cold (it did), we finally tasted the mussels and they were cold. Sitting in a broth this whole time on a night cold enough to warrant heating lamps outside, the dish we ordered first - came last, and tasted awful. My girlfriend thought it tastes like ramen.We asked for our waiter to take them away and we told him it was odd that everything came at once. He responded that we had mentioned we were sharing so he thought we'd want to share them all at once. And I responded that these were clearly appetizer and entr\u00e9e plates - it said so on THEIR menu. To which he said if we wanted them coursed we had to ask in advance. You have to ASK a restaurant to serve you food in a certain order Astounded, I said to him that we clearly ordered the mussels first, and mentioned we'd 'start' out with that. To which he responded by basically repeating himself.He offered to take the mussels back to reheat but we said that we were growing full since he was wrong again - the portions were HUGE.About ten minutes later, he drops the check off and says he's ending his shift and to \"take our time\". But then how could we order dessert or more drinks since the bill has been given?We looked at the check and the mussels were taken off - BUT the bill said \"100% didn't like it -$14\" - check out the picture I uploaded for proof \u00a0Not a joke. Bro, it's not that we didn't like it, it's that you completely screwed up the placement of orders, the food got cold and we wouldn't pay for that bsDespite the dude saying we should take our time, he was constantly hovering over us, checking his phone. Eventually my gf put down her card. He comes back and puts the card right in front of me. My gf awkwardly said \"uh that's mine\" and the waiter said \"I'm sorry, I just assumed.\" He was breathing down our necks when we were figuring out the tip.

If you don't mind getting your wallet raped, there's the lot across the street charging $4 for every 15 minutes. \u00a0Go down a bit on Hill St, there's Athena Parking for $5 flat rate. \u00a0Thank goddess! \u00a0When you finally arrive on the 13th floor, you climb a few flights of stairs (or another elevator) and arrive to the lounge. \u00a0The hostess urged us to self-seat. \u00a0But ain't it ever tacky to see that 1/3rd of the seats were noted reserved by a paper sliver left on the table tops. \u00a0Some denoted time, like \"Reserved 7:30.\" \u00a0I'm sure there' s a better way to handle reservations, but that's lazy management for you, I suppose. \u00a0And we were only the 3rd party there (and the youngest, where the chief demographics were very much aged mid 30+ professionals). \u00a0Hell, if I just got off work, I'd probably swing by and grab a drink too until rush hour's over.One thing about their \"aperitif hour,\" the actual kitchen doesn't open till aperitif hour ends (4PM - 6PM). \u00a0Bummer. \u00a0Not profitable to hire your chefs for those 2 hours huh? \u00a0But you still get the happy hour menu, consisting of charcuterie, fries, cheese, and such. \u00a0I gave their happy hour $7 cocktail, a French 64 a shot. \u00a0Cognac, Kronnenburg, ginger juice. \u00a0Not really for me. \u00a0The ginger flavor battles it out with the cognac for presence, and takes the taste fight after the 10th round for a win-by-decision. \u00a0The ginger notes are just that much stronger, which is a bit unfortunate. \u00a0Also gave their Royal, their concoction of a sparkling wine spiked with a fruity liqueur of your choice. \u00a0Comes in this nifty old-school bowl of a champagne glass. \u00a0Looks like this:yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026You like that pic don't you??? Got a reflection of Downtown LA, mirrorcle world style. \u00a0Yeah, that was totally on accident. \u00a0Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't help but feel like the bubbly effervescence fizzles out sooner due to the higher surface area exposed to air. \u00a0Tastes aaaaiiiight. \u00a0It's not like it's the Thug Passion combo of Cristal and Alize Red Passion or anything. \u00a0I think I'll stick to a dry sparkling/champagne or some Kronnenburg next time.French fries? The size and shape suggest they may be similarly sourced as Umami Burger or McDonald's. \u00a0Though, the batch we got could've used a bit more time in the fryer for crispness. \u00a0Comes with ketchup, and another dipping aioli which was actually rather tasty.Frog legs: if someone told you they were buffalo wings, made with the legs of a cornish game hen and they ate it, none would be the wiser. \u00a0Eats like something that could be had at Yardhouse or Buffalo Wild Wings. \u00a0But you'll fiddle with more bones in your mouth, as you call it \"buttermilk marinated frog legs, lily root and calvados honey glaze. \u00a0Fried brie is alright, but I prefer Izakaya Fuga's interpretation. \u00a0Perch has you dipping it in a raspberry roulade. \u00a0But Fuga gives you more creamy fatness for a dipping sauce.We did end up lounging for a few hours, shootin' the shit. Talkin' how a good friend of ours was all talkin' \"bro's before hoes,\" and \"GunPla for life!\" Yeah, that dude's MIA now with his significant other (but it's cool, He's a nice guy. \u00a0He deserves to get laid, and often). I still had room to gobble up some lamb slider burgers. \u00a0Yummy, lamby, juicy taste.You know for service, we were treated as pretty forgettable. \u00a0I will say that the kitchen works fast. \u00a0They do. \u00a0Plates come out within minutes. \u00a0But speediness of service is the equivalent of 5600/bps modem dial-up into AOL. \u00a0Feel free to add any necessary screaming and shrieking sound effects. \u00a0But you won't be at a loss of who the waiters and waitresses are. \u00a0They'll be wearing bow ties around their bare necks. \u00a0Midway through service, they swapped a waitress on us. \u00a0Who knows why, 'cause the original chick was still walking around 'n taking orders. \u00a0At one point, I had to flag down a busboy (dressed in all black, no bowtie) and ask if he'd take an order from us instead. \u00a0Poor guy didn't look too happy. \u00a0He looked like he just f^%$ed his mom. \u00a0But he was definitely more helpful.

She returns and when she does I ask her to talk to me so that we can work out the situation. \u00a0She refused and wanted to talk right in front of my girlfriend, getting her more upset The manager \"Jude\" says that \"we don't take special requests\" to sit by the glass railing, but we could wait for one and most likely it will be 9 before your seated... what a Bit%h... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So, we agree that we will wait to get seated by the railing and after the so called manager \"Jude\" still wants to argue, \u00a0again walks away. \u00a0I decide to go outside and take a breather. \u00a0I look inside and shes back again arguing with my girl, she then brings us to a table right at the door way between the Hostess stand and the patio area. \u00a0 Still wanting to put up a fight the manager girl keeps up her attitude, she gets so upset for what ever reason tells my girl, I'm going to get you kicked out of here! she turns to me and says your girl just hit me your out of here.... I was there the whole time and there was never even a hand jester of the sort. \u00a0 \u00a010 min's later the real so called Manager \"Erik Sorenon\" (he doesn't give his name either, just his first, even when I ask for his card he hand rights Erik@perchla.com) comes out and tells us to leave and when I ask why? \u00a0He says because your girl hit my employee. \u00a0I asked for proof and he replied we have cameras, I tell him to press charges then and he replies just leave.. \u00a0OK then lets see it, he of coarse doesn't have the time and can't explain why he couldn't come out and take care of the situation in the first place... \u00a0Perch your management has a lot to learn ! \u00a0 I have never been so insulted, humiliated, embarrassed and plain old treated like crap...  \u00a0When I said we will leave, but we will make sure we leave a comment on YELP about this, he laughs and says, it will just be removed....

I had the creme de cassis, and I loved it! There is a long list of these type of French bevs to choose from. I also liked the fact that the wine menu has a good selection of both red and white wine by the glass and by the bottle, and the pricing was very reasonable by LA standards. It is rare to find an upscale location in LA that offers wine by the glass for under $10!! Regarding ambiance, I walked in and I was instantly impressed. The decor is fab! Very classy. Then I looked outside and I was shocked by the AMAZING view. There is a lot of seating both inside and outside, so you never have to worry about being forced to stand all night. You can tell a lot of thought went into the design of Perch; it really is a gorgeous space. I would feel confident taking anyone here, from my parents to a group of girlfriends to clients. Men- if you want to impress your date, bring them here! Oh and the people here seem to be classier than at a lot of the other DTLA spots. I tried dinner here on my last visit, and everything was really good. I want to clarify that this is NOT \"fine\" dining. Some reviewers seem to complain that the food is not on par w/ other fine dining establishments in LA. The price point here is under $10 for apps, and $20-$30 for entrees... That price point is on par w/ middle of the road chain restaurants, people! That being said, the food is far better than these type of restaurants. I especially loved the seabass and the truffle fries. There is live music during the weekend, and the female singer can sing!! She covered everything from Etta James to Sam Sparro.

We were only allowed to see 2 floors with one being the rooftop. \u00a0Great views of the city, however, I like to view of DTLA Standard more because the location is surrounded by tall buildings. \u00a0The views are probably on par with Eleveate Lounge. \u00a0Perch only has tall buildings on one side and the other sides are the same height or shorter. \u00a0Perch has a lot of room, and from the max capacity on each floor, the two floors can hold about 300+ people, which is definitely a lot more than DTLA Standard. \u00a0For the soft opening, they provided a variety of cheese, bread, fruit, hummus, oysters, pastries, and frogs legs. \u00a0Benjamin the executive chef was kind enough to explain to me and others what he was serving. \u00a0I have a good feeling that at least the menu will be good.Since it's not fully finished, I noticed a lot of things not working. \u00a0Lack of water in the bathrooms at the end of the night was odd to me.

\u00a0Well, that novelty lasts for about 10 seconds. \u00a0Then you realize that you're looking down on Pershing Square. \u00a0If you've been to Pershing Square, \u00a0you know what I'm talking about. \u00a0Our office makes us park there, and people still worry about their safety, despite the army of security guards they have there.We discovered that there's a nicer second floor patio space where we actually could have had a nice table. \u00a0So we gave up our table downstairs. \u00a0After about 5 minutes, a manager told us that we couldn't be up there. \u00a0To his credit, he promised to find us a spot inside to replace the table we had given up. \u00a0So we took one of the couch areas that had the \"reserved\" signs when we came in. \u00a0I think they keep those signs there to give the impression that they're popular. \u00a0I doubt I'll ever take my officemates to Perch again. \u00a0Although the wait staff wasn't impolite, I'm not going to say that they're competent either. \u00a0Not if I have to go to a bar and go thirsty.You would have thought that Perch would want to make a good impression on a group of friends who work nearby visiting their bar for the first time! \u00a0But nope, that wasn't the case. \u00a0I'll stick to the all-night happy hours at Chaya, or even the food specials at McCormick's.Perch Management: \u00a0train your staff to be more attentive, especially to local firms that might have considered hosting other employee after-work events there. \u00a0I still don't understand the buzz about the Downtown LA bar scene. \u00a0Perhaps better on the weekends than during the weeknight happy hours. \u00a0When I first started working in DTLA, I imagined all these white-collar professionals all stampeding out of the skyscrapers and into the bars at the same time like in NYC. \u00a0But I have yet to find the great mix between drinks and people that exist in West LA.", "Date": "2011-08-12", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Andrew N.", "ReviewID": "DEg62rpbdNDZJamtSBR7Iw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not a fan of the logistics of this place. You get in line outside, get your ID check, get on the elevator, and press the button for the 13th floor. At this point you're probably thinking, \"Yes! We finally got in. That wasn't so bad.\" But wait, there's more! You get out of the elevator into an empty hallway and the bouncers direct you into a small, dark, and dilapidated room that is NOT a rooftop bar. It turns out that they have three bars on the 13th, 15th, and 17th floor.Perch occupies the 15th and 17th floor but you can't get up there if it's too crowded so they stuff you into Thirteen Bar. When there's more room upstairs, the bouncers will let some people walk up the stairs to the 15th floor. When there's room on the exclusive 17th floor (the real rooftop bar), they'll let you take the stairs up to the roof top. Needless to say, everybody's always restless on the 13th and 15th floor because they want to move up to the top. Was it worth it? I'd say yes. The rooftop is the best but if you're not too eager to get up there, the 15th floor is also pretty nice with an outside balcony that overlooks a decent part of downtown LA. The vibe and atmosphere are great. There are plenty of nice seats, chairs, and tables where people lounge around and enjoy their drinks. The drinks were pretty cheap for a rooftop bar and weren't bad at all. The crowd was pretty cool and trendy. Most of the crowd was Asians in their mid 20's to early 30's, probably in grad school or fresh in the workforce.

This salad was very fresh and perfectly dressed. The cheese, grapes, and candied walnuts paired well with the vinaigrette. WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO: This was okay. Just risotto and mushrooms. BACON MAC N' CHEESE: (without bacon) Good portion for the cost. $10.SERVICE: Horrible. Just horrible. Walked up to the hostess stand and was immediately asked to wait while we watch the hostess circle the patio. (keep in mind, we didn't even ask to sit outside) She returned and told us to follow her. She walked us to a small dinette table outside close to the outer railing. My first thought was, \"man, tonight is really cold\" and naturally looked up in the air for a heating lamp. (uh, why would you even think about seating us in this freezing cold weather WITHOUT a heating lamp and on top of that didn't even confirm with us if outdoor seating was even ok.) Anyway, i cut to the chase and told her I wanted a table inside. We got a table and was immediately greeted by the water server. He was simply just that, a water server. He told us our real server will be with us shortly. Smiled and left.7 min later: Server walked up and greeted us. Stared at us for a few seconds in silence and then told us she'd be right with us. Uh, my girlfriend and I looked at each other and automatically thought... AWKWARD! After she sped off, we pretty much watched her circle the whole dining area going about 100mph and definitely flustered with the work load. She walked super fast but didn't seem to bend her knees AND made weird 90 degree turns around everything. Maybe she thought she was holding her composure but we noticed the frustration she was going through. After a few more minutes of waiting for her to come back to take our order...I was already impatient and anxious to ask her about their vegetarian options. I asked and her one and only answer was SALADS. (she was affirmative with that answer might I add) Are you serious? That's it? After she said, Yes 2 more times....I \u00a0got pretty upset because in the back of my head I was more than positive an extravagant place like PERCH in \"health conscious LA\" had more vegetarian options than just salads. So that's when I pulled the menu back out and asked about the Bacon MAC n Cheese and Mushroom Risotto. Of course by now, she felt very embarrassed that she for ONE, doesn't know the menu well enough to recommend anything to me and TWO she was too in a rush to spend anytime on the menu presentation. I ended up getting the Mac n Cheese without the bacon and the mushroom risotto...AND a salad. We told her we were sharing these plates prior to her leaving the table but she never returned with small plates. Salad arrives and still no plates! We then asked the food expo to bring us some. He walked over to the cupboard behind us, looked inside, and walked away. My first thought was, they're probably out of stock on plates up here so he'll def go grab some in the back. NEVER RETURNED. We finished most of our salad but for the most part, it ended up on the table...THANKS. Ten minutes slowly past and finally our hot dishes arrived. They were all good considering how hungry we were by then. Server never checked up on us until the very end AFTER we finished our dinner. We asked for the check. Paid. Left.

HICCUP 1 - We arrived around 8:30, we asked if they'd had any openings so we could eat earlier, and the hostess pointed to one of the bar tables, all empty and marked 'Reserved', and said that was our table for the whole night, so we could eat whenever, go up to the bar whenever, pretty much hold court all night. Didn't make a lot of sense based on the reservation process, but good news!Our server, Josh, was fabulous. Asked and remembered our names, made great recommendations, and gave us good inside gossip. HICCUP 2 - The cocktail and food menus had just expanded, and he hadn't tasted everything - but that's management's fault. The drinks and food were all excellent. HICCUP 3 - Two people in our party were running late, and at 9:30 they texted to say they were stuck in line downstairs, despite the fact that they were included in our reservation and we had open chairs for them. After several visits to the hostess desk and an impatient manager, one of us went with the manager down all 15 floors to the line to get them in. HICCUP 4 - Apparently, the valets ask if you live downtown, and if you say yes, you get in a shorter line. Odd, and probably illegal.HICCUP 5 - Word was that the line consisted mostly of Asian club kids, and we'd heard there was a fight and someone puking on the floor in the previous week, so part of the strict line management was an attempt to keep club types out. As it got later, you could definitely tell that they couldn't decide whether they're a restaurant/lounge or a lounge/club. Low lighting, loud music, and prominent DJ suggest club, but strict crowd control and relaxed vibe suggest bar/lounge. That needs to be figured out.After dinner, we went up to the bar, which is gorgeous (although they don't serve the restaurant's signature cocktails - HICCUP 6.) At one point, two of our party went to the restroom - which requires going back downstairs - and, HICCUP 7 - after 30 minutes, came back to report that they had to wait in line again to get back upstairs. In fact, they only managed it when a fight broke out at the bar, and the guy controlling the stairs vacated his post. Listen Perch people, either find a way to let people pee hassle-free, or you're going to have a mess in those nice potted plants.At the end of the night, one of us went all the way down 15 floors on two slow elevators to discover that the valet was closed, and everyone's keys were at the bar.

First of all, what kind of a bad design is it to have to go up to the 13th floor, then having to transfer to another elevator to get to the 15th or 16th floor? How awful.Our waiter Kevin was the worst. Although he may be eye candy, the looks do not mask the poor service. Initially, we ordered the My Fair Lady drink. Unfortunately, we got the Marie Antionette drink (this is not what we ordered). It was a very obvious mistake because we drank it and it clearly was not what we wanted. We asked Kevin to change out the drinks to be corrected.We got the Duck Duck Goose as an appetizer. It was meager. Even as an appetizer, it was disappointing. Then, we ordered a cheese platter. We were wondering why this cheese platter took so long. It turns out that our waiter ordered us a cheese fondue, which is exactly what we didn't want. Again, we had to ask Kevin to correct this. I am getting a buzz kill at this point. So, we got our cheese platter and it was decent, although they do not give you enough thinly sliced toasted bread for the amount of cheese you get.By this point, we were at \"Purge\" for about 2 hours now and asked for the bill. Unfortunately, even the bill was wrong. They charged us the regular price for the appetizers (even though we ordered them at happy hour) and an incorrect number of drinks. Again, we asked Kevin to correct this but sadly when the bill was correct, it was still incorrect because the happy hour prices were not reflected again. Anyhow, he fixed it and gave us a discount for the food and drinks based on our horrible experience. Also, there is an open outdoor bar on the 16th floor, but the bouncers would not let us up there because they said that they were at capacity. Well then, the bouncers should manage that better so they don't run into this problem. I would strongly advise that people not come here. It is a waste of money as the little appetizers and drinks that they have are completely overpriced.

However, there was zero consistency in how the cocktails were prepared. \u00a0As a table of 5, we order multiple rounds of cocktails throughout the night. \u00a0Many had to be sent back because they were prepared differently the second or third time around.Second, the entrees. \u00a0I would recommend sticking with appetizers and small plates for the time being. \u00a0We were happy with the baked brie, the merguez sliders and the truffle fries. \u00a0Hard to go wrong, right? \u00a0However, the entrees were horrible. \u00a0Two of the fish entrees ordered had to be sent back. \u00a0One of them was served completely cold and uncooked. \u00a0The other had absolutely no flavor and was inedible. \u00a0None of the people in my party are quick to return food. \u00a0I can count on one hand the number of times I have returned an entree ever. \u00a0Third negative, the service. \u00a0First, everything took an exceptional amount of time to get to the table. \u00a0Our first round of cocktails arrived a shocking 25 minutes after ordering. \u00a0Establishments with a hopping bar scene typically prioritize restaurant patrons, usually by having a dedicated bartending staff for diners. \u00a0Clearly, our orders ended up fighting for their place in a queue with all of the non-diners standing at the bar. \u00a0Then, having sent back multiple beverages and entrees, I would have expected a visit from the manager and an apology from our waiter. \u00a0Neither of these happened. \u00a0An apology and a complimentary dessert would have ameliorated my negative experience, and probably spared them this scathing review. \u00a0 Lastly, I cannot neglect to mention the fact that they do not serve proper espresso. \u00a0We all ordered a double shot with out dessert, and we were served something which maybe came out of a cheap Bed Bath and Beyond home machine. \u00a0It was drip coffee disguising as an americano when we asked for espresso. \u00a0No crema, no taste. \u00a0When we mentioned this to the waiter, he again did not apologize or acknowledge the mistake. \u00a0Instead, he told us to write a letter to the manager. \u00a0I wanted so badly to love this place because of the ambiance and location. \u00a0Unfortunately, the restaurant did everything possible to make me never want to return.", "Date": "2012-07-31", "Author_Location": "West Hollywood, CA"}, {"Author": "M D.", "ReviewID": "z9GEb9EVlMq35v0NI0Ybug", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "See Nic D's review.

Venue: 5/5 Beautiful. Great views, cool vibe, and great general ambiance. Service: 2/5. The staff was nice, but not amazing. They kept bringing other peoples food & drinks to our table, which is just annoying and distracting. They even brought us the wrong bill. When I booked the reservation as a celebration dinner, I asked the host if we could go to the upper level lounge for drinks after and of course they said we could. I even called the same day to confirm our reservations since I didnt want anything to go wrong with my special evening. So after our dinner at just before 9pm we are told that the roof top lounge is actually closed for the evening and a security guard said to us \"some one spent a lot of money to have this be private so I am going to have to ask you to leave\"...epic service fail on behalf of the host and security. Food 3/5. The food was pretty good all around, but I found their dishes to be EXTREMELY salty.Apps: Seared Duck Breast - Awesome, absolutely delicious. Mussels - Tasty in idea, but way too salty. \u00a0I literally had to return the Mussels since it made my face cringe to eat them. Imagine that. Mains:Lamb Burger: A very delicious dish. The meat was fresh, tasty, garnished with greens and a preserve. Only flaw is that it too was overly seasoned with salt. It comes served aside some home made potato chips that have to be the best home made chips I have ever eaten. Braised Short Rib: Great dish and a very very large portion. The meat was tender and delicious. The sides complimented the dish very well. The only problem is that it was served warm, not hot. I am big on temperature when at a \"fine dining\" establishment and they lost major points on it. Dessert:Apple Napoleon- Yummmmay. It was very good. crisp, light pastry.

Apparently, Perch has decided to charge $40/person to sit at the tables! This is outrageous! Have the decency to inform your customers about the new rules before the reservations are made.

I had such high expectations! I knew this place had a notorious rep for unbelievably long lines, so we made reservations for 5 people at 1030pm. When we arrived, there was a long line already. I'm sure they've been there awhile. A lady at the door made sure we had reservations and told us to take the elevator to the 13th floor. We thought the restaurant was at the 13th floor, but we had to take another elevator to get to the restaurant :/ The restaurant was packed! Thank goodness the restaurant was open, so it wasn't musty or hot. The hostess checked us in, but we still waited about 10 minutes for our table (note: we were already 15 minutes late). If we had arrived on time, would we have waited an additional 25 minutes????? They seated us near the walkway, so my husband had to re-arrange himself (away from me), so no one would bump into him. The restaurant was just too small for the number of people that were in there!The food was not good at all, especially for the high prices they charged. We didn't order much since our primary reason for reservations was to avoid the lines outside and avoid paying the cover fee. We ordered buffalo wings frog legs, the truffle poutine, and another item on the menu. I didn't get a chance to taste the frog legs, but my husband said it was okay. The truffle poutine was dry and not cheesy at all and bland. The service wasn't spectacular either. She kept disappearing. We had to flag down the hostess to let them know we were ready to order and then later on, we were ready to pay! Did I tell you there was ANOTHER line (inside the restaurant) to get to the rooftop bar?! The restaurant was already packed, so adding more people to it made me feel like sardines in a can! And the wait wasn't short either. We waited about 15-20 minutes! Once we got to the rooftop, there were plenty of space, so I didn't understand the long wait downstairs! We were on the roofstop for maybe just over 1 hour because they were closing (mind you, we got there at 1045pm and they closed at 2pm. That's how long our dinner was because of bad service!)

I leave that up to my foodie friends. I have a friend that tries and tries to get me to pick lunch/dinner places, but in the end he always ends up picking them because it's just to overwhelming, and when you're dealing with a foodie like him, it's way too much f'ing pressure. Such was the case with Perch.I've never heard of this place, and had very little knowledge of what it was going into it. We had just gotten out of a play at the Ahmanson, and were still a bit early for the 6pm opening. So as we tried to eat up some time by walking there. Apparently, we are fast walkers because we still had some time to spare. So, we loitered around the lobby, and it's a good thing we did. As it go closer to the six o'clock hour the more and more people started to fill the lobby and get closer to the elevator. So with five minutes to spare, I called the restaurant and asked if I could get a reservation...in five minutes. They were very accommodating, and quite tickled with my request. It was a chilly night in November, so I thought for sure they were going to sit us inside. They sure didn't!The whole vibe is very 1920s(?) from what I could tell from the \"uniforms\" of the restaurant staff. I thought they were just weirdos who dressed up in bowler hats and suspenders when I originally saw them in the lobby, but then I saw that they worked there, it all made more sense. One of those \"ah-ha\" moments, but on a much much smaller scale.We were taken to our outdoor seat, and with the heaters on full blast, it actually wasn't that bad. And it just so happens all the people crowding the lobby where all one big group there for a surprise party that was happening on the inside, so the outside area was nice and quiet. We had an awesome view of Pershing Square, complete with view of the outdoor ice rink. It's the little things.We chose some wine, and my foodie friend talked me into having the fried bone marrow for an appetizer. I will try anything once, and I was pleasantly surprised by it. \u00a0I thought it funny that they served it still in the bone, but my friend did not. Presentation aside, It did make it a bit complicated. But it was actually really good on the toast and with the dried fruit they served with it.For my main entree I got the Boeuf Bourguignon D\u00e9construit (braised short ribs). I might not be able to say the actual name of it that well, but I could defiantly eat it with panache. It was absolutely amazing and over way too soon.The staff was great. There were a couple moments when our server took a bit too long to get back to us, including one time when we actually had to flag him down when he was inside. I do not place blame on things like this as I have worked in the industry before and sometimes nights go that way. If he was not doing it intentionally, then who cares. I ate an awesome meal and that's all that matters.I would for sure come back here. It's fun and different and the food was great.

But I don't know why we were treated like we were. This is not a place where you would want to be when a place is about to close.First, at around 1:30 AM, we were asked to have our last call for drinks. We were told by our waitress that we can take our time in drinking what we just ordered. We have the mental note that the bar closes at 2. (And later on we knew the hard way that by that, they mean that everyone should already be downstairs by 2.) \u00a0At around 1:41 AM, unruly security guys/bouncers started to tell us that the place is closed. We thought that they would give us time to finish our drinks at least since, we still have at least 15 mins more before they actually close. We have closed our bill during the last call and were enjoying the final moments at this rooftop bar. Then, came someone rudely telling us that rooftop is closed. We thought they are just closing out the open area, so we moved inside...only to be thrown out again. One of us ordered something which was never touched. If we only knew, we would have not ordered the last one.As diplomatic people that we were, we just followed and headed to the crowded elevator lobby. We had to go down 2 floors and when we got out, all our other fellow cattles were there. \u00a0We had to wait for any of the 3 damn elevators to take everybody down and the line goes by elevator. One security guy tried to stop someone from going down the stairs and recklessly bumped me without even trying to excuse himself or say sorry. I just had a drink so I was not really tipsy or drunk but even if I was, I would have remembered this happening!For the same ambiance, I would rather go to The Edison...and for the rooftop view, I would go to The Standard.

Although I had made reservations, we had to wait about 10 minutes, but I didn't mind because my friends and I hopped over to the bar and waited on a big couch in the center of the room. Music ranged from jazz to French music, I would say it's pretty upbeat, but was also mellow at some points. Mixed vibes, but I liked it.We had the lamb burger (very good, plus the homemade chips on the side were out of this world!!!!!), frog legs (light and flavorful), duck duck goose sandwiches (delicious, not a big fan of the bread though), and the cheese platter (great variety of cheeses and candied fruit). Overall, I have no complaints! Walking around the balcony area and the top floor (Perch owns 2 floors) was really nice and we found a good spot at the corner overlooking Perishing Square.

Good overall, nothing great, and a few things that need attention and prevent a higher star count.1. Service - definitely a bit of an issue. Host and hostess clearly do not want to be there \"working.\" This right at 6pm when they open. The servers then played the \"confused about which tables they are responsible for\" game for about 30 minutes. During that time several walked by and waited on the tables around us, all the while avoiding eye contact with us lest we ask them for something. Finally someone took our drink order but we did end up being served by 2 or 3 different people throughout the night so it seems we were \"up for grabs\" by the staff and no one was too interested in making sure we got attention.2. Food - decent but not great. Ordered the frog legs and merguez sliders appetizers. Frog legs are a nice alternative to wings but not much different. Merguez sliders lacked flavor; I couldn't taste the herbed goat cheese and red pepperade at all. BF got the classic steak frites which was ok and definitely heavy on the fries. I got the Bibb and Blue salad with chicken which as an entree may not be a good representation of what they can do in the kitchen. It was definitely underwhelming.3. Drinks - good but not great. Got the Perch Daiquiri, the My Fair Lady, the French 64, and a Kir with Creme Yvette. The French 64 was definitely the best of what we tried. 4. The View - I may be in the minority but I am not blown away by sitting on the roof on the 16th floor. Yes it's nice, but it is not extraordinary. And if you're going to have the majority of your seating outside, please make sure the heaters work, crank out a good amount of heat, and are plentiful enough to accommodate everyone. It may be LA but we still get chilly and when it's windy like it was when we were there you need the heaters. It took them 45 minutes to get ours working and when it did it was not sufficient to keep us comfortable.

The only thing I was able to try was the sweet and spicy warm mixed nuts- which were amazing. What I liked the most about Perch as the two roof tops where you can look out while having your drink. I never felt the desire to go to the second roof top above as the view was fine from the first roof top. For me, it had a sort of 50's swank to it. For those romantic minds it could very well leave you feeling like your in a movie. The crowd is generally dressed trendy cool. It's Downtown. The age range was mid-twenties up. This is not exactly the place to take someone who can't handle a great social scene or their alcohol. Bring some class. The staff was pretty nice- I found myself being asked several times if I could be helped when sitting at the bar. It did take a minute but this was understandable because the place get's pretty busy.

Rooftop bar:Drinks are still delicious and strong, bartender was easygoing and friendly. There are more nice patio furniture with heating lamps and fire pits. But the center of the space still only has standing room; which is stupid unless you have music and dancing/swaying allowed. Restaurant:This is where the fun began. We were seated on the outdoor patio, waited for 10-15 minutes, flagged two busboys down and still nobody ever came by to offer drinks, menus, or take orders. We went indoor instead: Fantastic decor, furniture, and music; it's like your grandma's sitting room (that is, if your Grandma rocks a Downton Abbey style mansion). Our waitress promptly appeared and took order, but the food did not appear as promptly. Steak frites was delicious, salmon tar tar was so so. We ordered lobster bisque, but it ran out, so they brought us French onion soup without even asking if it's ok to substitute. The soup was not good at all. It's like they were running out of soup at the end of the day and decided to add some water to it. In sum: great view, decent vibe, intriguing interior design. But there's some serious miscommunication between the waitstaff that results in ineffective service and the food' s hit and miss (at this price range this is not a-ok). \u00a0I may bring out-of-towners back here to woo them, but Perch won't be a neighborhood hangout spot for this downtown loft dweller.", "Date": "2011-10-08", "Author_Location": "Toronto, Canada"}, {"Author": "Hanna H.", "ReviewID": "w0tiRPDRzvEwcx0P-rCJtg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went for after dinner drinks and the selection of drinks was fun and unique. \u00a0The view is amazing and the whole bar is a very cool spot. \u00a0Great place to check out downtown and relax with friends. \u00a0 We went on \u00a0a Monday night and it was a very relaxed atmosphere and not at all crowded. \u00a0Hear it can be pretty packed on the weekends.", "Date": "2012-02-06", "Author_Location": "Rosemead, CA"}, {"Author": "Jennifer J.", "ReviewID": "Ul8shXL4zFD2Qm_TlzeUmQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This place is not worth going to unless you have time to waste.

I love the ambience and as a place to just relax with a drink it's one of my new downtown favorites. It would get five stars if it wasn't for the flat tonic water. Not a single bubble of effervescence could be found in the glass. Not once, but three times. No excuse.As a restaurant, the place gets two stars. Unlike other reviewers, I found the service to be great. The problem was the food. A very ambitious menu that seems beyond the abilities of the kitchen staff.Bread: A single roll, at least a full day old and clearly stale.Cheese Pot: A very good fondue and the best dish we tried all night. Unfortunately, it was served with the same stale bread and apples sliced so thinly as to fall apart in the cheese.Roasted Bone Marrow: The marrow itself was good, but then it's tough to screw up. The Melba Toast tasted as though it had been fried rather than baked and then left to congeal in grease for most of the day. The last thing you want with fatty marrow is more grease. Braised plums were a nice touch but the roasted elephant garlic added little to the dish but more grease. No acids served to cut through the oil. Nasty.Rabbit Rillette: The rillette itself was pretty good though I couldn't really taste any discernable rabbit in it. I know it's supposed to be a rustic dish, but does that include throwing in a handful of bones. I cracked my teeth on at least two pointy rabbit ribs. Candied kumquats worked well.Duck, Duck, Goose: The duck was excellent and well accompanied by the gooseberry jam.

I came here last night with a few co-workers for a happy hour and the decor + view = topnotch. It's definitely better than the overly hyped Standard rooftop. It's got more class, more seats, and a better vibe overall. On the other hand, The Perch has to figure out what it wants to be: a bar/lounge or restaurant. My co-workers and I wanted to eat while we were there, but there weren't many bar friendly options. There weren't many things to share, and many items were pretty small yet pricey. I don't go for drinks and ever crave risotto or frog legs. Also their happy hour menu is EXTREMELY limited. The happy hour menu they have online is not the HH menu they actually go by. We tried their Cordon Bleu \"Poppers,\" which were good but small and not worth the $6 happy hour price tag. Once the kitchen opened up, we tried the cheese dip, probably the most bar friendly type food, but it was just mediocre. Their french soup, is more of a deconstructed twist on the original, and I was not digging it. It lacked the baked cheesy goodness of the original, and also the caramelized onion flavor. They substituted those flavors with a solid pearl onion and a slab of bacon. Beignets. WORTH TRYING! Some of the best I've ever had. light, fluffy, and a delicious jam to go with it. The drinks, as other reviewers said, are pretty strong. I bypassed their cocktail list at the recommendation of a friend (she apparently tried a few before and was not impressed with any, especially for $12), so I instead ordered a whiskey sour. It was solid, tasty, and strong. It was also only $9 compared to their floofy $12 cocktails. The service was rather slow. It was hard to get the attention of a server, especially during Happy Hour. The bartender I spoke to was extremely rude. I should have gotten his name, but his interaction with me along with other patrons just left a lot to be desired. He was offensive, unfriendly, unhelpful, and he made it seem like I was infringing on HIS time.I'd come back again for the awesome view and the strong drinks, but avoid the food and that bartender.

The hostess greeted us warmly the moment we got off the elevator (15th fl). \u00a0We told her we were there for drinks & she showed us the main bar and the cool patio. We asked her if we could go up to the 16th fl for more unobstructed nighttime city views but, apparently, it's only accessible on weekends. It was a mellow Tuesday evening when we came & there were still plenty of room to move around & available seating to actually have a nice, relaxing time to just unwind & enjoy a cocktail or two.The cocktails, on the other hand, were another story. In my honest opinion, I consider it very pricey at $12 especially once you see how TINY the glasses are. I do recommend My Fair Lady, although I had to make really tiny sips for it to last me. I forgot which drink my hubby got but it was very STRONG (too much cognac) & nasty. What a waste. Since we didn't have dinner there, I can't say much about the food.

Unfortunately, my experience at Perch was so terrible that it inspired me to begin writing on Yelp to prevent others from making the same mistake I did.My boyfriend's parents and his sister were coming in to LA, and I really wanted to take them to a restaurant with a view, good food, good service, and an ambiance that stimulated interesting conversation. In pictures, Perch seemed perfect, so against Yelp's advice, I made a reservation (for 9:30PM on a Tuesday, mind you!).The parents and sister arrived early and ordered drinks from the bar. My boyfriend and I got there at 9:35PM because I had gotten off late from work. We alerted the gentleman at the hostess stand of our arrival, and he searched frantically for a hostess to seat us. There was an empty table for six in the middle of the interior area - this was obviously our table because there aren't that many large top tables.For some reason, no hostess was to be found. (Why the guy could not seat us himself is still a mystery.) Anyway, eventually six people sat themselves at the empty table that we had been standing around waiting for. A waitress instantly began serving them, so I figured that they must have a different table set up for us.At 9:50, a hostess finally comes to seat us. We follow her outside....to a low cocktail table....with four seats....right next to the very loud band. She brings over an extra chair so that all five of us have seats. Unfortunately, the table is about the height of a coffee table, the couches are slightly higher (a section clearly meant only for after dinner drinks), and the fifth chair they brought over is at the height for a normal dinner table. So, our fifth person is at least 6 inches higher than the rest of us.And then the band is playing, and it is impossible to hear anything that the person 3 inches away from you is saying unless they are yelling at the top of their lungs.It becomes abundantly clear that our table was stolen/given away, and that they have shunted us into this obnoxiously loud little cocktail area. However, we're still willing to give it a shot because we're hungry and thirsty. Except that, for the next 20 minutes, no one comes to take our order.After having worked a 12 hour shift and getting very hungry, I was becoming rather annoyed. I approached the hostess stand, told the hostess that I was aware our table had been given away, we had been relegated to a corner next to the band, and had not seen any semblance of a server during the entire experience and to please seat us somewhere quieter and where we were all level with the table. She seemed put off that I had suggested that our table had been given away (puhleeeease, of course it had). But she agreed to seat us elsewhere right away.We were brought to a table inside, which was much much better. HOWEVER - still no service! After 20 more minutes of waiting for a server, we finally flagged down another server and asked her to send ours over to us. Another server comes over and does the \"Oh sorry for the mixup!\" speech, takes our order for appetizers but totally misses our drink order, and then we don't see her again for, well, longer than it took to finish the appetizers. Needless to say, we didn't bother ordering anything else. And of course, we didn't receive any sort of compensation.My apologies for the long story, but it was one that needed to be put out there. And I am obviously not alone in saying that this is one of the worst, WORST places for dinner that I have ever been to in any city.

It was our first \"rooftop bar\" experience together and we were pleasantly surprised by both the food and the incredible ambiance.

We then wasted no time in ordering the Truffle French Fries and Baked Brie. \u00a0They were bomb. \u00a0The french fries are smothered with truffle cheese (which resembled blue cheese in both texture and taste). \u00a0The baked brie was slightly crispy on the outside and creamy on the side (yum) and the accompanying salad was just kind of lackluster (meh). \u00a0For the main event the GF got one of the specials for the night, butternut squash ravioli with a mushroom cream sauce, and I got the braised short ribs with horseradish mashed potatoes. \u00a0The ravioli was a home run. \u00a0The butternut squash was creamy and sweet and the mushroom cream sauce was savory and smooth. \u00a0It reminded me a bit of the pumpkin ravioli and cream sauce I've concocted in the past. \u00a0The braised short ribs were on point. \u00a0Though the portion was almost obnoxiously large. \u00a0I'm a big eater and this was a behemoth amount of meat for what I consider a \"bar food/ finger food\" kind of joint.

And after having recently moved to this area, I thought it would be a nice place to break us into the downtown lifestyle.First of all, let me stress most importantly: Make a reservation if you want to get into this place in a timely manner. Otherwise, you will wait in one of many huge lines outside like a jackass. Secondly, make sure you bring a good photo ID because the hostess at the front of the line checked both mine and my girlfriends and you would have thought we were being examined by an FBI agent in training (despite the rest of her nowhere near resembled such a description). I've never had my ID scrutinized so closely by anyone at a restaurant or club.Once we were let through the \"guard gate\", we walked down and entered the lobby entrance of the building which led to an elevator. \u00a0Luckily the group of eager to party drunk women in the elevator with us seemed to know where they were going. I remember looking at how elegantly my girlfriend and I were dressed that night, me in suit and tie and her in a cocktail dress, in contrast to the girls were. It looked like they were going to a club. Not what I was expecting.After we arrived at the 13th floor we were greeted by a security guard who directed us to a second elevator across the hall. We got on that and took it to the top floor. Definitely the most exclusive restaurant I've ever been to. Makes you feel real VIP.We got to the top floor and checked into the host stand. I made the reservation online through OpenTable and made sure to also make a very specific note that this was for our anniversary in hopes they would give me a nice table in a good area. The first table choice was not ideal and a bit awkward; it was only a few feet away from a group of lounge seats that connected to the patio outside. Luckily the hostess was kind enough to give me a few other options since I wasn't happy with the first one. We ended up sitting outside on the patio next to the door and patio. The views are definitely the most attractive quality of this place. Servers are dressed casually. Prices are a bit high because it's obvious you're paying for the views and exclusive nature of the location. The good news is is that the drinks are STRONG and well mixed. I highly recommend the Penicillin (famous grouse, lemon juice, agave nectar, ginger liquor). The food was absolutely the best part! We started with the LAMB SLIDERS....highly recommended! My girlfriend got the Mussels as an entree and was very satisfied. I had the Pan Roasted Chicken Supreme. Moist and delicious! Finished off the dinner with Almond cake which is served with tangerines and gelato. Hell yes.

It has been languishing on the internet due to the Yelp apps inability to post reviews from the phone. Since the first encounter, described below, we have returned several time and always enjoyed the opportunity.First of all: Loved it!!! Second, I like to get a little high. I reluctantly invited my girlfriend to the Standard rooftop for a sunset cocktail, as we had just gotten back from NY, spring had sprung across America, daylight savings was allowing us sunshine until nearly 8pm AND we were both working downtown that day. Alas, when we arrived around 5, there was a line of hoochies in micro-minis thronged around the entrance. Apparently, YACHT, were playing in two hours, so the rooftop was closed until then. (Sidebar: I remember first hearing YACHT about 5 years ago and wondering why anyone would want to be mercilessly subjected to these ennui-inspiring tones. So, it was particularly disappointing to have my evening curtailed by such an unfortunate and lame obstacle.)At any rate, we left for the \"newly\" opened Perch, which is the best rooftop bar in downtown, by far. The cocktail program is excellent. The Janis Joplin-inspired bartender we had was super cool. Perfectly making both on and off menu drinks, offering wine samples, and making drink and food suggestions, all while efficiently handling food orders and the bills for a very crowded room. We chose to sit at the bar, as the outside seating was not suitable and we weren't going to stay long enough to be seated in the dining area. We had an array of appetizers and even a second round of oysters. All were delicious. Paired with the cocktails, we had a lovely experience. I have long tried to be a connoisseur of rooftop dining or imbibing destinations downtown. As a small boy, my Aunt played piano in the spinning bar at the Bonaventure. To this day, I love going up there for a spin, but the drinks are very expensive and very bad. When I lived on 12th St, I'd pop in to Windows for a drink and even had a lackluster meal there. The view was great, to the West. But it wasn't very fun. And when AT&T gutted the space, there was only the Standard. \u00a0I was delighted when the Standard opened. There was a good month before it was overrun with d-bags and teens learning how to drink and swim. But that was 10 years ago. I still love to go there, on a weeknight or late afternoon, but it's usually amateur hour for our bridge and tunnel crowd up there. Takami is a view restaurant, not quite on the rooftop, but it has delicious Japanese fusion and adequate drinks. But the view is not particularly impressive and the design doesn't make you aware of the elevation, for some reason. So, I can never tell if I'm high or not. So, it's wonderful to find Perch, with an expansive view, intimate space, excellent food and delicious cocktails. It attracts both attorneys and hipsters, but the mix is neither excessively \"office-y\" like the Edison, nor the Spring Break aesthetic of the Standard. It's wonderful to finally have an excellent and romantic restaurant to supplement Takami in the good food and drinks at a higher elevation category. I can only pray that Johnny Depp will sell off his floor in the most beautiful bldg downtown. Until then, I'll be getting high at Perch.", "Date": "2013-05-29", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Lana G.", "ReviewID": "CHh7iG-xJ_f-kHKb4FOMeg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good atmosphere, nice view, nice place. \u00a0Good food", "Date": "2013-08-01", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Denise C.", "ReviewID": "EiISbQq3hema56nwTtDBJg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perch is a welcome addition to downtown LA.

Called \"an elevated resting place\" on it's name placard yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026 on Hill St, Perch truly is just that... a classy rooftop lounge but without the pretentiousness of The Standard. Since it's opening about a year ago, I've been here multiple times to eat, drink, enjoy the live music + soak in the views both in the sunlight as well as under the dark of night. The ground floor elevator takes you up to a 13th floor level from which you take a separate elevator to either the 15th or 16th floors of Perch. The 15th is the main level featuring an interior dining room yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026 with antique furniture, the main bar area yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026, + of course the famous outdoor patio seating yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026 with absolutely lovely views over Pershing Square yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026 to the southwest corner. \u00a0The 16th floor is a more intimate space yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026 with its own bar + slightly better 360 degree views. It tends to be closed to the public on weekday evenings but is available for private parties. The embossed menu books yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026 feature drinks (wine, cocktails, liquor list, etc) in the front pages + then a page or 2 for the food in the back... + rightfully so as the drinks are the star here. yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026 I've tried about 1/2 of the cocktails on the menu + have been quite a fan of the complex tastes of each of them... sweet, strong but not too overwhelming on either end of the spectrum so that you can savor it. They'll cost you $9-$13, but they're worth it. \u00a0I've only had nibbles of the $11 Truffle Fries + also the $14 Mussels with Saffron + Cherry Tomatoes during the dinner hour before, + I didn't think they were particularly extraordinary for the price. But then again, every available table was filled with dinner patrons on a Tuesday night so I'm sure there are other dishes that are better than what I tried. \u00a0Perch becomes quite crowded with a line forming down the block by around 10pm on the weekends so I recommend coming in the early evening to avoid the bar scene crowd wearing tiny skirts + dresses that would never see the light of day. Or alternatively, this venue can also be quite nice in the daytime with its brunch menu + lazy Sunday vibe with live music. Views, of course, are just as nice yelp.com/biz_photos/K-Fb\u2026. As a umm.... precautionary warning though, I recommend being careful when looking over the ledge of the 15th floor as it can be uhhhh... very easy to drop things....

Before it was a nice solid crowd pleaser, no stand out foods or service, usually very crowded, one of those see-and-be-seen kinda places. It's no wonder, there's a killer view of dtla from the 2, yes 2, rooftop areas! The bottom has tables and connects to their indoor loungey area. Go up the stairs and go to the more open, casual rooftop. That's where I like to hang out. Amidst the christmas lights, views of the building that was in Batman (the gothicy looking one, just imagine the gargoyles added in to make it Gotham), and the pretty people, you can't help but feel like this is where the young and cool come to play after a long day at FIDM or somewhere close by. Added perk for night time is that they have a separate line for DTLA residents, which moves much quicker. Bring your ID or a piece of mail showing your DTLA address and you can practically skip the 30plus minute line everytime! It's great. Take the elevator up to the 13th floor, then move over to another elevator to the 15th or 16th, pick your pleasure. No cover ever, that's a beauty!BUUUUUT on this sunday afternoon, with perfect LA sunshine streaming through, good friends, and seemingly all the time in the world, perch took on an entirely different light. It was casual, it was chill, old but comfortable. Not stuffy. Not crowded. Chairs to lounge around everywhere, separate DJs spinning in their own little worlds. Just lovely.Stayed here for hours. The cutie bartender helped, as did the amazing cucumber drinks that he made. And we noted they do sunday brunch now, with $12 champagne bottles.

However, our server Sean was pretty good and I thank him for accommodating to our request to send things back! \u00a0Sorry, dude but tell the chef the customer is RIGHT! I feel like I was on Restaurant Impossible with Chef Irving from Food Network, except for the decore...was OK.I had the mixed green salad with candied walnuts, sliced pears (VERY THIN MIND YOU) and sliced red onions (TOO THICK), with a \"couple\" of raspberries as a garnish I assume? \u00a0It was a typical salad, nothing to whoot about. The dressing was good, but the onions overpowered the taste of the pears and the lettuce. \u00a0The nuts were perfectly sweet and crunchy which kind of mellowed out the flavor of the onions, but please explain the 2 raspberries! \u00a0It had no business being in that salad except for adding \"color\". \u00a0It actually threw off the taste when I ate one. So be it. \u00a0My main course was the escolar. \u00a0Ok, I have never had this white fish before so I was excited to try something new. \u00a0When the dish finally came out my first impression was \"Wow, what a small pc of fish (THIN cut too) and small plate to go along with it. I was sharing my plate with a friend and when we cut into it, it was tough and over cooked, and tasteless. Other friend had the same dish, but hers looked quite different than ours and she claims hers was cooked perfectly. \u00a0So, what happened to ours??? \u00a0So, we called the waiter and told him the situation and to have him taste it too. He forked into it (could tell it was not tender) and took the pc back to the chef to show him the dry pc of overcooked fish. He comes back and tells us that the chef explained it is just the \"crust\" that is hard and the middle is soft. NOT! \u00a0So...was this NOT cooked right? \u00a0Hmm. \u00a0For $30 bucks I expect a nice pc of plump fish that is fork tender!!! \u00a0Thank you! \u00a0So our waiter Sean suggested to maybe try the other fish on the menu which was the salmon, so we did. It came out pretty quickly. \u00a0The salmon was on a bed of super cheesy risotto topped with fish roe (not sure which one- but not salmon roe) and micro greens. \u00a0The dish looked colorful. So we took our first bite of the fish. \u00a0It was tender and cooked perfectly. Tasted alright. \u00a0However, the fish being on top of the risotto that was too cheesy and somewhat undercooked did not compliment the fish at all. \u00a0It overpowered the flavor of cheese vs. fish and it definitely lacked texture, as well. \u00a0In my opinion I think this dish would have been better if it had some sort of green vegetable for some added texture.The fish roe did add a tiny bit of 'ocean' flavor, but again with the cheese risotto it just threw the flavors off. \u00a0I thought in the \"culinary\" world it is not kosher to serve cheese with fish. Anyways, this dish overall was basically bland. \u00a0We didnt even finish it. \u00a0Oh, the cut was a little bigger than the escolar. For the drink I got this ginger flavored cocktail...the waiter did warn me it's the least favorite amongst everybody but I decided to it anyways bc I love ginger flavored drinks. So It comes out (mind u they have tiny drinks for $$$) I take a sip and bleh..it's SUPER nasty! Like, really nasty with no obvious ginger flavor at all. \u00a0It tasted like gasoline. \u00a0So the waiter was nice enough to let me exchange it out for a mojito (my typical when I don't know what to drink which is quite often). Lastly, the \u00a0Dessert...bread pudding and creme brulee. Both were not the best I have ever had either. SIGH.....The bread pudding was buttery from making it with croissant but lacked any sweetness and was a bit on the dry side. Edible. I'm a big fan of creme brulee and this was a little grainy in texture whIch was displeasing in my mouth. Overall my dining experience was a disaster. But thank goodness the desserts were compt!Nightlife after dinner: \u00a0So we decided to stay, but went down to the car for something and by the time we got back-10 min later) there was a huge line forming downstairs JUST to enter this place. \u00a0REALLY? But they let us back in bc I told them we are here for dinner. \u00a0Anyways, there are 2 rooftop outside lounge areas. \u00a0Half of us were up on the top, which the rest of us below were not able to get in and the line is ridiculous! I'm sorry, but I am too mature to be standing in line to get a drink and for a mediocre view, so we just ended up staying at the lower level rooftop area. Ha it sucked so bad. Unless you were right next to the dj playing on his computer, you could not hear any music. \u00a0The servers are not too friendly and these ppl think this is some POSH place. NOT! \u00a0And I will never come back here for either food or entertainment. \u00a0I am tired of spending $$$$ at crappy a$$ places. OH, and I find out this place went through 3 chefs already, getting their 4th...and they are unsure of their identity.

All of this would be troubling enough, if it wasn't that Perch aims very high- and fails spectacularly. I called at 6pm to make a reservation. Let me point out that in the past, I tried to make a reservation but got a recorded message stating they were not accepting reservations \"at this time\". Well... at 6pm on Thursday, I got lucky. Someone picked up the phone. I asked for a table at 10pm that same night, for two people. And I was told that the latest they take reservations is 9:45. So I agreed and that was that. Table for two, 9:45. Boom. I was at an event with my lady, and I purposefully left the Q&A early because I didn't want to be late for Perch. I didn't want to show up 5 minutes late and have them tell me that the kitchen was closed, or that they could no longer seat me. So I showed up at 9:43. PERFECT GODDAMN TIMING. The place was bustling. It's a very cool looking spot, what with the view and the retro decor. I walked up to the reception area, where two employees were manning the reservation desk. A dude and a chick. The dude goes \"um... we're waiting for a table to free up- you should go upstairs and we'll call you. Have a cocktail\". Call me? As in, they'll physically find me? \"No. We'll call your cell phone. Make sure you have it on you because it gets loud up there\". Our lovely, romantic dinner has already started to sour. Why? Because standing around in the bar area, with my phone out, waiting to be called by the Gods, is definitely not my idea of a lovely romantic dinner.So now we're upstairs. We're sitting around. We're waiting. I look at the watch. Minutes go by. We're surrounded by financial dudes and hipsters. My lady is diabetic and she's starting to feel funny. I look at the watch again: it is now 9:57. Almost 15 minutes past the reservation time.I run back downstairs. I calmly go over to the reservation desk. I ask about our table. And I get the same answer. \"We're still waiting for a table to open up\". And I basically become very agitated. My side of the argument was that I made a reservation for 9:45, and it was not respected- but what REALLY gnawed at my nuts was that I was told specifically to get there on time, since they don't accept reservations any later. The answer: \"we keep the kitchen open later than 9:45\". I also tried explaining that this was simply bad scheduling on their part- because NO restaurant that takes itself this seriously would have a customer waiting for 15 minutes while they wait for the previous party to leave- and after that customer made a reservation. That means that the staff overbooked, or is not very good at arranging the space. One employee's sarcastic remark was \"we don't like to kick people out while they're still eating\". Much like the current west vs. middle east ideological conflict, it seems that Perch and I have two very different views on how a restaurant should be run. FINALLY we got seated at a table. And here comes the fun part. Our table was impossibly wonky- I am talking about \"we are on the Titanic and shit's sliding all over the place\". I asked to get it fixed THREE TIMES. At this point I am dying for a drink. So I order my go-to anxiety medication. A Negroni.Well. Guess how many attempts THAT took? Five. FIVE. The third attempt actually resulted in a dude bringing me a Coca-Cola, which was hilarious. In a frustrated daze, I actually burst out laughing at the ridiculousness.We ordered food. Truffle fries, tuna tartar, duck with gnocchi, sea bass.I would rate the food, overall, a C-.The only thing that was genuinely good was the duck. It was very nicely cooked and the balsamic reduction wasn't too overpowering.But the rest was simply disastrous.- The truffle fries were smothered in cheese, with nay a hint of truffle oil to be found. --- The tuna tartar came in a comically large, long plate. On one end were three chips, and on the other was the tartar. Which was completely tasteless. - The gnocchi. Oh. My. God. Apocalypse Gnocchi. Chef needs to learn the SALT THE WATER before putting the gnocchi in. They were completely tasteless. Regardless, they were overcooked. - The sea bass. Also overcooked. Instead of being flakey and delicate, it was tough and lumpy. It sat on a bed of gross risotto. You know when risotto has not been amalgamated properly? When the rice grains and the liquid are not one? Yep. Welcome to Perch.Truthfully, the view was beautiful and my lady and I were too amused by this train-wreck of a restaurant to really take it badly.

Maybe Perch is better thought of as a lounge that happens to serve food and not as a restaurant that happens to have a cool lounge. But then again, the wine and cocktail list at Perch also happens to be mediocre at best too.Whenever I check out a new place, I like to order up more than I would normally so that I can get a good sampling of their menu. I was not really impressed with anything that was served. It's not that the concepts are bad -- they sound very good on paper -- but the execution is flawed with many dishes being very unbalanced. And I am by no means a wine snob, but when your Syrah looks like engine sludge, you probably should change up bottles. The Pinot Noir was better, but with a very heavy note of barnyard on the nose. Our server -- who was very, very good and the highlight of the experience -- explained that the manager liked earthy wines. Earthy is fine, but these could only be described as swampy. Alice's martini was pretty good though. I probably should have gotten one or three of those.Highlights/Lowlights:- Cordon Bleu Poppers: first cousins to Tyson frozen chicken nuggets.- Duck Duck Goose: the mini club sandwiches are delicious, with the delicate toast points crumbling nicely after an initial give. Loved the combination of textures. But, if you eat it as a sandwich, the filling gets pushed out. If you eat it without the top toast, it's too salty. I think the way to go is to put the top toast under the bottom toast. I wish I had thought of it at the time.- Roasted Bone Marrow: I've never met bone marrow that I didn't like. The fleur de sel has a nice mellow, savory taste as opposed to a sharp saltiness that rounded out the richness of the marrow nicely.- Boeuf Bourguignon Deconstruit: it sounds good on paper, but the thing that makes beef bourguignon taste so good is the melding of all the flavors. By deconstructing the dish, you lose all that makes beef bourguignon great, and are left with bland beef and limp veggies on a plate.- Perch au Noisette: the filet was good, but the tomato carpaccio was made from unripened tomatoes.

I tell the hostess I have a reservation for 8:30 her and another man kind of stare at some sheet for a while, she asks if I want inside or outside, I then reply with, we had a \"special\" table reserved we're here for our anniversary and she kind of seemed a bit confused on where to put us, she then takes us out side to a private little sector or the restraunt \u00a0and sticks us in this small little table NEXT to the fire place table we were suppose to have, like I was told on the phone. I was quite irritated about that seeing as how that was obviously the better table and we were getting stuck with the less appealing table. I started to say something about it, they apologized. No big deal we were going to get on with the night...The view was beautiful! The seating was a bit uncomfortable as it was a pretty tight space, there were three other tables out on this small patio and although intimate, if you're sitting next to an obnoxious drunk couple making out the whole time and talking very loudly about obscene things well then....your romantic atmosphere is SHOT! (That's what we had to deal with) The entire dinner I was just waiting for them to leave...not to mention they were the ones that snagged our table...So i was extra irritated. The lighting in that particular seat is non existent so it was hard to read your menu, we had no silverware, the waiter was a bit un-noligable about the restaurant and menu, he kept trying to rush us, and that was a bit annoying. We had to keep asking for things, he wasn't so bad but definitely could step up his server game! We started with Salads, both great! and then the main course, Steak Frites and short ribs, I LOVED my steak frites and my husband thought the short ribs were so-so. For the price I will say I was expecting a bit more, but It was a lovely evening, we enjoyed ourselves. I would like to come back another time and be closer to the live band and be in the mix of the restaurant a bit more. They did manage to remember my special dessert I had ordered and it was REALLY good, I think it was creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with vanilla ice cream. Super tasty! I would recommend this restaurant but If you're having a special event I would arrive a bit earlier then your reservation to make sure you are getting exactly what you are anticipating, because if not, it kind of puts a damper on your evening.", "Date": "2013-12-13", "Author_Location": "Burbank, CA"}, {"Author": "Richard C.", "ReviewID": "pyEwEp-nmGh_YOizbRWC1g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "what can \u00a0I say about this place ... you have to come and check it out the food is great service wonderful and the view awesome i recommend bringing your significant other to share this with", "Date": "2011-08-04", "Author_Location": "Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Syv P.", "ReviewID": "hRLwlfKvyO09LePbeVzajQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm so glad I decided to have my birthday brunch here.

Goodness this was an awesome one!! \u00a0& highly recommended. As for my second experience at the Perch, I planned a birthday Sunday Brunch with 12 of my bestest gfs. Please be aware they can't make a regular reservation for such a large party. I spoke with one of the events coordinator, Jamie Lagoyda. She's an absolute doll! She returned my phone calls with the quickness and as well set something up for all my guests as they arrived. This was all done 4days prior to the date I reserved it for. Hands down they took care of us and it was definitely hassle free. I've planned plenty dinners with a large group of friends and this by far was the fanciest that we've ever gone. It was very impressive, memorable and within budget! \u00a0:) please believe it!! I wish I could remember the name of the guy that made sure everything was ok the day of for Jamie... He was very sweet and welcoming. Hands down The Perch La really impressed me both in a simple dinner date aspect of things and as well as an event coordinated aspect.

It was that bad.Perch is marketed as an upscale French, classy restaurant in downtown Los Angeles. Well,....it is in downtown LA but that's about it. I came expecting at least the likes of Comme Ca, Papilles or Le Comptoir. I was sorely disappointed. This was over-sauced, overdone yuck food. (I recognize how immature that sounds but really can't come up with anything more accurate.) We started off with the baked brie (brie wrapped w/ puff pastry served w/ pesto cream & baby salad). I think it's quite difficult to mess up baked brie because even Trader Joe's does it right! It was a circular pastry, appropriately flaky but lagking in that buttery goodness. There was scant amount of brie baked inside and was served room temperature and thus, was congealed. Baked brie is supposed to be warm, flaky and simply oozing warm brie goodness; this dish was none of that. The best part were the scattered heirloom tomatoes on the side of the plate. The day I choose pretentious tomatoes over a baked cheese pastry is a bad day.Bummer but chin up, because we had frog legs on the way! I have only had frog legs at Papilles (deliscious btw) and was excited to try Perch's version which was buttermilk marinated frogs legs tossed in house made buffalo sauce w/ blue cheese sauce. Ummmm, I could've sworn they were serving buffalo chicken wings from Pizza Hut! It was so disgusting, I took it personally. The sauce was very, very strong, obliterating any benefit the \"buttermilk marinated\" step may have had on the frog legs. The sauce was so overpowering, it could've been slapped on anything; chicken wings, frog legs or tofu cubes and the dish would've tasted the same. Yuck.Ok fine. So no luck with the starters but the highlight of the evening was yet to come; the entree. I went with the salmon on a bed of lemon thyme risotto and topped with caviar & chive maderia cream. Sounds amazing, right? Wrong. Uugghhhhh. The salmon would've been fine-nicely cooked, but it was simply dripping with the caviar and chive cream which was extremely salty and too strong for the delicate flavor of salmon. The risotto? same story. It was like a lumpy bed of salt. We didn't even bother with dessert.Again, keeping in mind that Perch is advertised as one of LA's finer dining establishments, the wine list was much like the food- it didn't live up to the reputation. It was average, at best, but heftily priced. The service added insult to injury. Everything took so very long and that's just the necessities- taking our drink order, taking our dinner order, serving any food and bringing the check. Any service beyond the previously mentioned basics, did not exist. Our waiter did not stop back to offer us a second glass of wine. Our entrees were served by someone else and our waiter didn't bother to stop over to see if we needed anything to accompany our meal or to see how the food was.The only thing nice to say is that space is beautiful. I'm too disheartened by the experience overall to muster the energy to describe it, but it's certainly worth checking out. Just sidle up to the bar for a drink. Having said all of these bitchy things, it was so pretty here that I WANT to like it. Maybe brunch is better?

You can alternate between spending time on the restaurant level (a mix of indoor and outdoor) and the rooftop deck. Drinks are expensive as they always are in LA. My best tip (if you haven't read my quick tip) is to get here early, before 10 PM if possible, or you will end up spending most of your night in line.

I went there for the first time last weekend to celebrate a birthday. We had called ahead the day before to make sure that a large party wasn't going on the next day to ensure that would get through the line in a timely manner. We ended up waiting in line outside for almost an hour and were told there there was indeed a party that would be ending at 10:30pm, and then we would be able to go in. People who answer the phones at this establishment should know when large parties are happening because we would've brought our business elsewhere had we known that we would all have to wait for so long. It gets worse. When we (a group of about 25 of us) finally got to the front of the line, I checked in on Yelp (did not write a review, just checked in), and apparently this pissed off the hostess? She proceeded to ask me if I was ok and I said yes and asked why she was asking (because I was fine, just a bit irritated about the whole line situation). Then, the bouncer says something along the lines of the following to me: \"she has to ask if you're ok because we can't have you go in if you're too drunk.\" I was NOT drunk, and the fact that both of them reacted like this about me checking in on Yelp is embarrassing to them and insulting to me. Next, all of the girls were let into Perch. After I walked away, the hostess was talking behind my back (to MY friends) about how rude I was, how I shouldn't go in if I'm going to be writing Yelp reviews, and how I need to be nicer. I waited a week to write this review because I still honestly cannot believe that all of this happened. I'm generally a very nice person who doesn't complain, but this really put me over the edge. Also, if you can see that I'm active on Yelp, wouldn't you try to be nicer to me? When everyone finally got in, the credit card machines were down so the already slow service that I've read about on Yelp was even SLOWER.

I'd have to walk by transients muttering violently to themselves while women with breasts bared would parade past me with long overcoats. \u00a0I'd even had a guy or two shadow me while I made my way to drink spots like the Golden Gopher or the Varnish. \u00a0Not this time. \u00a0Now I'll fork over a measly $10 for peace and safety.I went here for the second time on Friday. \u00a0The valet recognized me - how odd is that?

The place is spacious with outdoor seating and dining on the first level while there are lots of room to roam around upstairs (but you may have to wait in line to go up after a certain time). \u00a0There are also washrooms upstairs, so there is no need to leave your coveted seat behind to make your way down two flights of stairs to use the wc. The crowd is also very mixed and diverse, which is good for my girlfriend, who digs only white guys while I, admittedly, have a thing for Asians.In the end, as I was leaving, I was aghast to find that my valet ticket was nowhere to be found. But, as I mentioned earlier, the valet recognized me and brought my car around anyhow.

It was a Thursday night. I rolled up around 10 or 10:30, pretty excited to know there is another rooftop joint DT.Everything was going great, the view was amazing, the beer list is decent, the service was ok (nothing to complain about.) We were having a great time and then all of the sudden the tables turned. Me and a few others had seperated from the group to catch a different view and smoke a cigarette. At that time, the bouncer came over and announced \"Last Call.\" It was like 11:35. We all had full drinks and were debating on getting one more to close the night out. Before we could even finish our smoke, the bouncers came back to announce \"Ok folks, you gotta go.\" We were definitely a little taken aback, they literally just gave last call 2 minutes ago. We got up and walked back to our group, followed by the bouncers. Once we get to our friends, he tells us again to hurry and finish up and go. I tried to talk to the bouncer, he wasn't having it. It got to the point where I asked to speak to a manager, he told me \"No.\" I asked he bouncer \"And your name is, sir?\" \"None of your Fucking business.\"WHHHHAAAAATTTTTT????? I had only had 2 beers at this point and luckily was able to keep my composure. I went to the bartender (still being followed by this ogre bouncer,) and asked for the manager. While I did this my girl (the birthday girl) went to talk to the owner about what was going on. Finally the manager came over, I explained what happened and the behavior of the \"security.\" The manager offered no condolences and was basically like \"what do you want me to do?\" I told him that I didn't know what he should do, but that I was going to write a review about my experience here. The managers response: \"You think I am afraid of a Yelp review?\" Now, at this point I am done with the ogre who just cursed at me and I am done with the management, my girl is still talking to the owner and we are all waiting for her (STILL being harrassed by the security guards who are STILL rudely barking at us to get out.)Finally, I was done waiting, and I just wanted to get out of their before I lost it.

Good fries, OK sliders. I could not have the tuna tar-tar & brie because of me being pregnant and all. (4) After the dinner orders were placed, the food was brought out 45 minutes later, and not all at once. The brought out 2-3 plates at a time and they were all were cold (5) I ordered the spare ribs on a bed of polenta. The meat was not bad, maybe because I was starving...but the polenta had to be the WORST polenta I have ever had. Polenta is a very simple dish, never thought I would complain about it. The polenta tasted as if they poured a whole cube of Knorr beef bouillon into my single serving. GROSS (6) My co-worker ordered the bouillabaisse, which according to my cookbooks and Wikipedia (yes I wiki'd it!!) is a stew with broth. Apparently, Perch has a different take on it because it did not have much broth. The ONLY reason we went to Perch was for this dish since my coworker (the one that ordered it the night was there) had it previously and raved about it. According the manager (WHO WE HAD TO SUMMON 3 TIMES AND FINALLY HAD TO TRACK DOWN PERSONALLY), the menu had changed...but since when has bouillabaisse changed??? STRANGE! The manager did offer to have another order made, but at this point the whole table was disappointed, and we just wanted to leave. We did not want to wait an hour for her replacement meal. \u00a0JUST AS A SIDE NOTE, THE TABLE BEHIND OURS WAS A FAIRLY LARGE PARTY, WHO SIMPLY WALKED OUT - IN DISGUST OF THE POOR SERVICE. We at least stuck around to pay our order, but we should have just walked out too. As you can guess by now, I will not be returning to Perch, nor will I recommend it to anyone; which is a shame because the location is wonderful. There are better places to go in/near Downtown LA, so no loss for me and those I know. I cannot see this place in business much longer if they do not improve their service. Once the hipsters find a new place to go drink, this place will be lost be lost (shame).That's it folks, thank you for reading.", "Date": "2012-10-12", "Author_Location": "Pasadena, CA"}, {"Author": "Kasey E.", "ReviewID": "M7SoKsC44f7BU55PbWma7w", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off let me make it clear that I never made it to the second floor of the bar. \u00a0It was far too busy even though I tried several times from about 10pm to 12 on a Friday night. \u00a0I did wait about 25 minutes to get in and had a nice laugh at the \"downtown resident line\" that didn't seem to move any faster than my line. \u00a0The whole door situation was a bit to scene for me to be honest. \u00a0When I first arrived I got a drink without a problem but by the time I was ready for a second round the bar was 4 or 5 deep and I just gave up. \u00a0In general I was put off by what seemed like a extreme number of security guards and waiters trying to snake their way through crowds with plates of food. \u00a0The lower floor terrace was nice and they had a great live band that unfortunately ended around 10:15.", "Date": "2012-02-27", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Alexandra G.", "ReviewID": "ijLjC9njg0-tZ3LzLyuaRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went to dine here last night and was impressed from the moment I walked into the building. \u00a0I am a dork when it comes to buildings, so any old building that has been properly cared for rubs me the right way.Upon entering Perch - you are swept with a 1920s Paris dark room with a downtown view that will take your breath (& I say this being a location scout and seeing lots of views) \u00a0The vibe was busy as it was a Saturday night but it was perfect way to spend a Saturday. \u00a0The cocktails are excellent & creative. \u00a0The food was mouth watering. \u00a0Please have the mussels & the lamb burger. \u00a0I haven't been eating meat for a couple months & when I bit into that burger my mouth watered and it was worth not being veggie for a moment. \u00a0However, for the veggies out there - you have options here: great salads, a cheese fondue, pasta, etc. \u00a0I am interested to visit perch again on the weekday & check out a sunset happy hour.

Then we were told we had to wait in another line to go to the rooftop bar. If you're in good company, the time goes by really fast and we were able to go in within about 15 minutes.

I ordered a mojito, which I watched the bartender make. Though I know he put lots of Bacardi in it, I could barely taste it--I thoroughly enjoyed the drink! I also tasted my friends' tequila sunrise and rum&coke -- all with bursting flavors and just enough alcohol. Needless to say, the expensive amount you're paying for your drinks is compromised by its taste and the experience you get when you're there.

It was a huge mistake coming down here.After a long company meeting, we came here to have dinner. Parking was SUCH a bitch. Street closures, cops stopping pedestrians, weird ID checks, the fucking works. I saw there was parking near the building on 4th and Hill (the lot) but the cops wouldn't let me park there and told me to find another lot so what am I going to fucking do? Disobey the cop and go back to Canada? SIGHHHH so we parked another block down. So my coworker and I would've only had to walk TWO blocks to the Pershing building but EFF the cops also blocked us again, said no pedestrians, so instead we had to walk FIVE!! additional blocks up the hill and back down the hill so we could go where it wasn't blocked. The atmosphere wasn't exactly the most pleasant because there were helicopters hovering above, loud music, screaming, misc noise just coming from below and above. Also, one complaint I had was that they had the music SO loud, their little french jazz or whatever that I couldn't really carry on a conversation without semi shouting and straining my ears to hear what others were saying. However, the food was decent. The baked brie was good, but not as Brie-ish as I would've liked, the brie was warm inside, but not enough that it was a little bit melted and gooey. We also had the truffle fries which were good taste-wise but texture-wise a miss. They were extremely soggy and not crunchy. I could definitely taste the truffles, but there was also like cheese melted into it making them soggy so it was just overall kind of eh. The cheese and charcuterie plate was good, especially enjoyed the one white goatish cheese. I ordered the caviar salmon which was the best thing I'd eaten that night. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was moist. The caviar provided just the right amount of saltiness. The lemon thyme risotto could've definitely been cooked more, because there were parts where the risotto was really hard and chewy, seemingly undercooked. The Bouillabasse looked really good and I had a bite of fish from my budbud and it was tasty.Also had two bottles of malbec and a syrah-pinot blend called c'est la vie, but the malbec was much better I think.

(Based on Meal Alone)There are restaurants with tons of hype, especially throughout Los Angeles. With a surge of talent and culinary variation, to be such an epic letdown is something I find nearly unforgivable. There is a great deal of talk of how amazing Perch is, how extraordinary dining there is, and while I cannot deny the plausibility of such an exquisite location, their Brunch Chef needs to care FAR MORE about what is sent out. (And let me just say I'm not alone.) Sure, every chef has an off day but...We order the champagne: Pol Clement with a side of pureed peach. Without missing a beat, Paul disappears and soon reappears with an ice bucket, a bottle, two glasses, and the peach puree. He pops the cork and pours it effortlessly but once the glass is filled, we realized we need a stirrer. As we surveyed those around us who had ordered the same thing, it seemed that was the one little necessity this cocktail warranted. (So Perch LA if you're reading this, suggestion would be to serve the Bellini with a glass stirring stick that goes with your lovely vintage theme...)Now as our appetites long to be fed, we begin with asking about the oysters. They're not available - in the process of finding a new supplier. We go with the salmon tar tare as well as their wedge salad. The salmon arrives and it can be summed up by saying it was a cute idea: the salmon, bread, quail eggs, and avocado compote is resting on the plate creating the \"visual\" a little \"food\" man.I take the bread, smear on the compote, put the shiny salmon atop it and ice it with the half of a quail egg. First bite: way too gummy, not enough citrus, and a strange barrage igniting an unfortunate lack of flavor. The aftertaste was like someone left the slimy guts of the fish and forgot to actually get rid of the waste. It wasn't good. And I really wanted it to be because it was presented so playfully, which I appreciate. Next - the wedge salad. While I love a good salad, at a restaurant like this, I find it highly lackluster to have to even make the next comment: at least the salad was good. Well, at least at the first couple of bites were before the sun began to completely misappropriate the lettuce, overheat the buttermilk dressing, and rob a salad that may have actually been - dare I say, great - no ... no, I don't dare say. But, this really was the best dish of the entire meal. (And while the heat had its way, I ate almost every bite and it was good ...)As we contemplate (rather hesitantly) what exactly we are going to order, we decide to share the \"two filet medallions served with mushroom and rosemary potatoes\". We spark up conversation w the two gentlemen sitting beside us. We saw their Eggs Benedict arrive and asked them how it was. Without pause, they looked at me and said, \"AWFUL\"and then the one gentleman said, \"if I can be honest, it was the worst breakfast I've ever had\" and then his friend chimed in to add, \"I'm certain they used store bought English muffins and I mean the bargain brand\". YIKES! The highlight was we sat down to an amazing duo shared Sangria and Bellini's and waited for our final dish to come. It did.Oh boy where to begin with this dish! The \"filet medallions\" looked like dried up pieces of meat that were NOT cooked medium rare with truly deplorable excuses of mushroom stalk resting atop them. The potatoes looked (and tasted) like day old leftovers and surprise surprise - not a sprig of rosemary in sight. I couldn't even take a photo - it was that ugly. Really? For a restaurant so notable, so revered, what in the world happened?! This was by far the worst brunch I have ever experienced. Thank god for alcohol!The only positives I can add are these: the server was wonderful, service overall was good, management was accommodating, the drinks were fantastic, but the meal was not even \"Denny's\" grade. A hundred dollars later, stomachs in disgust as the alcohol kills any further trace of bland and \"over-hyped\", all I have concluded is Perch is NOT where you go for remarkable food. Clearly this is where you go for exquisite ambiance, ear candy with an impressive selection of live music, and loads of mysterious cocktails by way of fun mixologists like Jenna who you can find perched in the bar nest above at the highest rooftop bar on the premises. So when you feel the urge to come the only day they're open for brunch, STOP and ask yourself, \"Is this worth it? Is it worth the long wait? Is it really that good?\" - Save yourself the trouble. The answer is a hearty - NO. It's not worth it. To my dismay, any longing I had to try dinner here has been snuffed out by my brunch experience which is a shame. So - Perch LA - you've got some undeniable work to do and I'd start with your standards of quality and taste. You are capable of MUCH better (PLEASE!

Once you are inside the restaurant, you realize that whoever decorated the place is probably stubborn with terrible taste. They killed the authentic Art Deco elements of the building with the shabby chic Loews patio furniture. First, were seated at an outdoor patio woven coffee table that went below our knees. For dinner. We asked if we could have a regular table, like, a dinner table. When they moved us, my knees were hitting the legs of the woven table and Im 5'1. So uncomfortable for myself and my husband who is 6'2. His friend ordered the chicken kiev or cordon bleu, which came with peas. It looked and tasted like one of those children's microwaveable dinners. Clearly the food was frozen and poorly covered up. At over $30 a plate, I know I was just paying to stare into the amazing penthouse next door and imagine I was there.The drinks were good. Unique and strong, I like that.

But since my experience here was so bad & I want to let people know how much I didn't enjoy this place, I decided to write a review right away! I've been here for drinks & dessert. Loved it. Loved the view. It was definitely on my \"good list\".However, I recently came here for dinner & had a horrible experience!First, even with my reservation which I made about a week in advance, with a note saying I want outdoor seating, they said I cannot get the outdoor seating, where there were clearly open tables! I said I'd wait, but they said they are over booked. I actually had to wait for my friend for about 10 minutes, but they made me sit by the elevator, even though the table they gave me was few steps from where I was standing. Instead, I was given probably the worst seat possible with no view at all. We waited a bit, then asked again, and they FLAT OUT LIED TO US saying that the table outside that was open for a while is for a special engagement, for an anniversary celebration. But what did we see? Two guys dressed super casually, almost inappropriately for somewhat fancy place as Perch; no, they were not a couple which was way too obvious. More than anything, it was their super snobby, almost bitchy attitude that ruined it even from the beginning. Then the food. Okay, I already knew the food was bad, but all the \"recommendations\" were HORRIBLE! Especially the baked brie, which had NO BRIE whatsoever...Ummm... where's the cheese? Other food was bland and came out cold. But once again, fine. I already knew their food was not acceptable.To add to my horrible experience, my friend's water cup was broken and she almost cut her lips! But all they said was 'sorry' and took away the cup before we can sue them.Overall, please, Perch...You really need to step it up...I am sooooooooo tempted to give it a 1-star, but because I had an okay experience the first time, I will be generous and give it an extra star.", "Date": "2012-07-16", "Author_Location": "Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA"}, {"Author": "LO L.", "ReviewID": "USOg9QY0odfIcDst7UhYtA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You really can't beat this view and feel in downtown LA. \u00a0The drinks are a little pricey but this isn't a place you treat yourself to every week. \u00a0It's great for birthdays, dates, get together s, and other special nights! \u00a0The food is pricey as well, but everything I've tried has been delicious. \u00a0( Swordfish, surf and turf sticks, ceasar salad, the chicken, steak frittes, braised short rib with polenta, and the \u00a0bouillabaisse.) \u00a0My only complaint is that the three times I have went, I've made reservations, and have had to wait more than an hour for our table. \u00a0They always have some excuse as to why our table isn't ready. \u00a0One, the band set up where our table was suppose to be, but the band is always in the same spot, so I didn't get that. \u00a0Another was, the party before you is finishing up their desserts. \u00a0Hmmm, one hour later than expected on a work night makes a difference. \u00a0So, reservations or not, you will end up waiting!", "Date": "2013-03-19", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Michelle S.", "ReviewID": "39eyO5qlrkWJ5u_o-xNujg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "loving the vibe.. and the food ..couldve done better if they have more selection of bar drinks (most of the cocktails we requested they were out! even olives lol)service..is a hit and miss especially on busy days or nights", "Date": "2012-11-02", "Author_Location": "Glendale, CA"}, {"Author": "Andrea M.", "ReviewID": "GxJ7OQPy6l3Ex1KBO8q8qg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Truffle Fries are a MUST!

It's not a casual place but with the spectacular view, your fancy self could only compliment it!

So good, we were approached by someone as to what we would like to drink, after our drink order had already been taken. The food was also decently priced. I pay the same prices at restaurants in LA for bad ambiance and views. For food, I got the Perch Burger. One word: yum! With a fried egg slipped in there, it reminded me of Europe. I guess the modern French pop playing in the background helped with this. My sister ordered the Huevos Rancheros. Something I normally think of as heavy, was made light and refreshing. It came with black beans, which I think made all the difference. I guess the Smoked Salmon Crepes were a bit bland, but nothing another glass of sangria and a look out at the city won't distract you from! If I have one thing to say, it's that pictures won't do justice to how beautiful this place is, so it's definitely a hot spot in LA I would suggest!One tip would be to make a reservation if you're going to brunch here.

The trick is to go early to avoid waiting in line. Anytime you have to wait in line, score goes down automatically. As for us, we arrived at the restaurant around 8:45 for a dinner party, so the experience was quite astonishing.The elevators set the swanky and urbany tones. The restaurant itself is decent sized; it feels spacious because it's half open on the rooftop. I didn't get to top floor but we had out table set up out in the patio on the 1st floor of the restaurant. As everyone else has mentioned, amazing view and the ambiance! I especially love the retro couches/chairs and painted tiled floors. It sort of reminds me of Edison where a flapper dress would've totally fit in.I was with a bday party of 13 so we sort of ordered and shared bites tapa-style, and mostly appetizers. - Complimentary bread with butter and olive spread (5 stars). I'm not just giving it 5 stars because it's complimentary, haha... I loved how they were handed out individually by the server onto each one of our plates, and as many as you wish. The rolls were fresh, and the olive spread was a nice touch.- Cheese Dip (4 stars). This is a great sharing dish, perfect munchy food with drinks too! Love the Balsamic swirl on top of the cheese.- Duck Duck Goose (3 stars). 3 finger sandwiches with smoked duck meat; I liked the flavor of the meat and the european lettuce, but the bread tasted stale. - Porkbelly sliders (5 Stars). Deeeeeeeelish little smoked pork belly sliders with fried quail eggs on top! YUM... the porkbelly was extremely aromatic, smoky and crispy (think extra-thick sliced bacon), not fatty at all! And how cute are these tiny little fried quail eggs, perfectly cooked with runny yokes. *Note to self - steal the idea and add lil fried quail eggs to sliders at the next dinner party or potluck*- Steamed Mussels (3.5 stars). Quite generous for appetizer portion and for the price. Decent flavored broth, nothing amazing.- Shake-n-bake Frog drummies (3 stars). I was impressed with the originality and the presentation, but underwhelmed with the taste. Tasted very bland, like under-seasoned chicken. - Shredded Rabbit (3 stars). This dish is a bit confusing. It comes with bread and kumquat puree on the side, like a spread. But when you fork into the meat, it just falls apart (not spread-able). There is no binding, instead in the texture of pull pork (without any sauce). Interesting dish but forgettable.Dishes on the other end of the table looked interesting too. The restaurant is definitely keen on presentations. Overall this isn't a place you'd come to pig-out and expect a revolutionary culinary experience. But for the beautiful lounge atmospheres and superb service (both bartenders and wait staffs!), I'm very fond of this place. Crowd: Older, more mature yuppies.Price: $$.

Nice addition of Spanish chorizo and cherry tomatoes. I wanted to ask for more grilled sourdough bread to sop up all that yummy broth. Coq au vin- This was an entree but the portions were more of an appetizer.. Did not resemble a traditional Coq au vin at all.I was expecting a braise or stew. \u00a0Enjoyed it , but would have preferred they rename the dish.. it was more of a fried popcorn chicken with a red wine reduction. $27 for this dish was pretty steep.

ServiceHostess were not too friendly.. come on this is DTLA not Hollywood. We had a reservation so we didnt wait very long. It was pretty busy for a Thursday night. As we were seated we were greeted by one server than was switched to another server. We wanted to order a bottle of wine. So we asked the server what he recommended.. I told him I did not want something too spicy or high tannins. He kept pushing the Malbec which I don't typically like. \u00a0So when we got it it was very high tannin and spicy.. exactly what I did not like. I asked new rockbilly looking pin up styled server if I can change it for the bordeaux and she said \"oh we dont' have that one\". I\"m thinking so why do you have it on the menu. So she went and gave me a sample of the cab. When I told her I liked it she brought a new bottle and took away the glass that had the sample. Why would you take it away... what a waste. Didn't understand that. In the middle of the meal my friend asked if they had pomme frites. Server said NO.. Isn't this a French themed restaurant. A little disspointed. Also felt the need to wave down our server the whole night for things. Overall I would come back for drinks and apps. But the entrees left you wanting more. If you are going to charge close to $30 for an entree it should be an entree size.

I also got an order of the cordon bleu 'poppers', which was a very solid deal for $6 - basically are breaded pieces of chicken with prosciutto and swiss cheese. They were very well-prepared; the chicken was moist, and the cheese was at its gooey best...only complaint was that it was hard to pick out the prosciutto.All in all, a very nice rooftop.

Now, to my friends who say \"I'm scared of DTLA or thats TOO far to drive down THERE\", Perch is absolutely worth the trek! It's a magical place with beautiful decor and unparalleled views of downtown (we know how much I love rooftops!). Erin, my current happy hour partner in crime and colleague decided we would check out the Friday Apertif Hour (4-6) pm. We ordered the sliders, bruscetta, truffle fries and the truffle mac and cheese. The truffle mac and cheese is amazing and it was devoured before I even had the slightest chance to take a picture. For those of you looking for healthier options, they have a great fruit platter too! They also offer wine, beer, cocktails and kir royales. We opted to try ALL the kirs settling on the blackberry as our favorite.I enjoyed the happy hour so much that I decided I would be back on Sunday to check out the brunch from 11am-3pm. I have to admit, I was lured in by the $12 bottles of champagne. I found the brunch to be pleasantly delightful (even before the champagne kicked in). We ordered the BAKED BRIE with creamy pesto sauce & a baby salad to start then the FRENCH TOAST with banana maple syrup and brown sugar bacon - YUM! Elle tried the THREE EGG OMELET with pan seared mushrooms, spinach, gruyere cheese and potatoes.Definitely \"perched\" at the top of my go to list for happy hour or brunch and worth the drive downtown! I can't wait to host my next event there!The only thing I would love to see at Perch is a slightly longer happy hour maybe going until 7.

We acted as if they had actually helped us...and walked ourselves over to a comfy couch and sank down into its comforting cushions. \u00a0We were facing the bar, so we had to crane our necks around to glance at the skyline which was magnificent and made me think it could be a spot for romantic dining, that is, except for the \"welcome\" thus far and the horribly loud \"unce, unce, unce\" pumped out by the lone dj in the corner which made conversation impossible unless you had your lips literally shellacked \u00a0to a receiving ear. \u00a0Did we get in the club by mistake? \u00a0No, not possible, I know no \"accidentals\" get into their club. \u00a0Is L.A. just determined to compete in the snob charade marathon of all cities in the US? 10 minutes...and our waitress decided to pay us a visit. \u00a0Not a word of \"Welcome to the Perch\" \u00a0or \" Can I get you started with drinks this evening?\" \u00a0No. \u00a0We got someone who was obviously tired, not much up for conversation and hailed us with a \u00a0direct, \"Have you decided?\". \u00a0I guess everyone that goes to the Perch has the menu memorized? \u00a0I mentioned a menu would be nice, but not knowing when we'd get the next chance to order we ordered a round of drinks and water to start. \u00a0She popped back with the menu and left \u00a0again. \u00a0Fortunately we had a LOT to talk about...because 15 minutes later...precisely nothing had happened while we sat and watched \u00a0a string of waiters and bus boys running \u00a0back and forth, none of which meant to serve us. \u00a0Did I say 15 minutes? \u00a0Try 20. \u00a0Even when the table of six on our left cleared out and a 4 top \u00a0on the right got up and left. \u00a0It was getting close to 10:30 pm on a wednesday night....and we were sitting at a place that thinks they're hip while the idea of service is unknown. \u00a0 So finally, the drinks came....and we got a chance to order \u00a0some appetizers. \u00a0The baked brie and the mixed greens with pears and candied walnuts. \u00a0The couple sitting across from us, with the girlfriend that was all over him trying to block his view of us, finally left....so we slid over to face the view as fast as our high rise stilettos would allow, except for Smith of course who walks in comfortable Italian shoes. \u00a0The waiting time got better...just 15 minutes for the appetizers. \u00a0The salad was amazing, crisp, fresh and full of little savory elements like the sweet bites of pears and crunchy walnuts. \u00a0The Brie, wasn't anything special, at least I toast slivered almonds and roll the brie in them before I bake it so it's a melting, delicious globe of Brie goodness with crunchy bites of almonds with my favorite holiday cheer. \u00a0Lucky for us, dessert civilized us again. \u00a0The creme brulee wasn't overly sweet \u00a0and the glaze was crunchy while the custard was ohhh so smooth. \u00a0In contrast the bread pudding was baked to create that slightly crunchy top that slides open to reveal a moist custardy vanilla and creamy bread melange. \u00a0But wait, how about that hot rich, espresso and the aromatic teas that we ordered? \u00a0But I can't wait, the spoons keep dipping into the irrisistible brulee and the bread budding is cooling too fast to wait or so I think while the minutes whip by and I try to resist while my spoon hovers and hovers. \u00a0We ordered our coffees and teas at the same time as dessert, didn't we? \u00a0 And \u00a0the waitress just couldn't manage to time them together? \u00a0I could understand some slippage with a 4 course meal but dessert and coffee arrive so far apart the desserts were demolished before the coffee arrived? \u00a0Aw come on, chef, do check that your staff has the basics in hand, for those of us who actually enjoy sipping a beverage while savoring every bite of your winsome desserts. \u00a0You're making it very hard for us to frequent The Perch more than once.", "Date": "2012-08-04", "Author_Location": "Downtown, Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Rebecca V.", "ReviewID": "jP2i9muzhOlwW4oPiPHt6g", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The roof top bar provides a gorgeous atmosphere. \u00a0The line to get into the bar however is not so pleasant.", "Date": "2012-08-04", "Author_Location": "Hacienda Heights, CA"}, {"Author": "Matthew G.", "ReviewID": "-6nZCFtRlgWRgjsPkhJnhA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This was my first time at Perch and I have to say it was a very pleasant experience.

After all this, one would think that I would've only gave them one star, which, to be honest with you, they probably deserved. \u00a0I mean, they even brought everyone's alcohol with the exception of one person's for over half the meal, once again, even after several reminders and even rounds for the other people. \u00a0But, the reason I gave them two stars instead of just one is because my salmon with lemon risotto and bread pudding dessert was actually pretty good and of course, the view is amazing. \u00a0I mean, even though the service was slow, our waiter was really nice. \u00a0I even thought I may return to just the bar upstairs for drinks and the view, since that's where we headed after dinner, and it was very lovely. \u00a0But, then a very snooty bartender ruined that as well. \u00a0I definitely won't be going back...not by choice anyway.", "Date": "2012-07-22", "Author_Location": "Irvine, CA"}, {"Author": "Mrs C.", "ReviewID": "mA3YtUSPP6vthcvsbL1vKA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "LOVE this place.

It had just been open two weeks when we arrived last Saturday night. We didn't know what to expect, but we were looking forward to the rooftop bar. We heard the views were magnifique! We had a reservation at ten, but we arrived at 8:30 and had planned on just hanging out. When we arrived though, to our surprise the table was already ready! Our table with a little reserve tent just waiting for us. We were really surprised to learn that it was, \"our table\" all night long..meaning we could go upstairs to the rooftop bar at any time and come back down and our table would be waiting for us. Sounded to good to be true, but three people confirmed it for us, including our awesome waiter Josh. We started out with drinks and appetizers and all was delicious. We had the French 65 and one of their champagne mixed drinks and they were sooo good. Let me stop by saying Josh was amazing. He was such a nice guy and was there for every thing we needed/wanted. Always with a smile. He was super fun too and I would recommend you ask for him by name!We had their Duck Duck Goose, their Cordon Bleu Poppers and a Cesar Salad to start. The Duck Duck Goose was awesome and while I wasn't a huge fan of the poppers my friends really liked them. The Cesar was also really good with real anchovies served on top. For dinner I had the Perch au Noisette. Really tasty and fresh. I admit I was a little confused with the whole Perch idea. It was Perch fish, so I assumed the whole namesake thing was on the fish, but then on their site and if I remember correctly on their menu there was a bird...a Perch. So, maybe it's just anything that's a Perch...not sure. Should have asked. My friends if I recall had Boeuf Bourguignon D\u00e9construit and the Pork Confit Cassulet and everyone seemed to really enjoy them. So all around food is a major plus.Some of our party ran late, and I'll say although it all worked out, this was the strange thing. B/c this is the hot new place \u00a0it gets pretty crowded towards the end of the night. So, a line starts to form downstairs. We didn't see any of this when we arrived at 8:30. Two of our friends arrived around 10 and they got stuck in the line downstairs. Now, most people downstairs were waiting to go to the bar on the rooftop. They wouldn't let our friends up even though they were part of a dinner reservation. We had to engage Josh who engaged the Manager who engaged Security who called for our friends. We had to do it twice finally getting the Manager to walk down with one of our friends to actually pick them out of the crowd! It all worked out, but that was a little weird. Our thoughts were that if our friends were part of our dinner party and not for the bar they shouldn't have to wait in a 30 min line.

Be prepared with a jacket, however, if you're prone to chill from night breezes.It's posted that Perch is on the floor 13. In fact, it's on floor 15. The first elevator goes to 13, then you use the \"penthouse elevator\" (the best way to describe it) to 15. Imagine that you have a family member or friend with a posh downtown penthouse that has a generous balcony. This describes Perch's space. Just off the elevator is a casual and spacious room that is the restaurant's lounge and bar. It's filled with comfy looking chairs and sofas, has a full bar with bar stools, and the vibe is lively. I can easily see myself here to meet friends after work for drinks and to unwind.There are a few tables in the lounge for dinner, but the main dining space is the balcony. The furnishings here are wicker love seats and coffee tables (four-tops), as well as compact French style metal tables and chairs (two-tops). French pop music plays constantly and at a pleasant sound level. The view is dominated by the glorious 1930s concrete building across the street. One can argue whether the view is better facing north or south, but see about being near the fireplace on the north end on cooler nights. When the dusk-time breezes blows through, not even the gas heaters are up to the task of warding off those sudden chills.I started with:_Aperol Royal (there are a number of \"make your own\" Royal)_Rabbit Rillette (served with three condiments: vanilla-shallot marmalade, braised plums, and candied kumquats; and thinly sliced and toasted rustic bread)_Marrow Bones (served with a side of seasoned salt, coarse sea salt, arugula, and toasted pain de mie)_Duck, Duck, Goose (three little sandwiches, each with a variation of prepared duck, with greens and toasted pain de mie)The first thing of note is the perfection of the toasted pain de mie. They are quarter-inch thick slices of precisely toasted fine-grain bread. At first a revelation of technique, they become monotonous. Of course, that's what I get for ordering two hors d'ouerves that happen to have them.The weaker of the three starters is Duck, Duck, Goose. The toasted pain de mie takes away from the subtle flavors of the duck fillings. Also, stacked as a sandwich, the lack of give from the toasted bread makes biting into them an awkward effort.The Marrow Bones are textbook delightful. The hot and oily marrow soaks into the pain de mie, turning the bite into a glorious beef version of shrimp toast. With a sprinkle of salt and a pinch of arugula, it's wonderful with the Viognier that I ordered after I finished my Aperol Royal.My favorite starter is the Rabbit Rillette. It looks huge, but the large timbale form of meat is light, fluffy, subtle, and well seasoned which makes it easy to finish. (Beware of a bit of bone or two. Oh, well.) Also making it easy to finish are the condiments, especially the candied kumquats which--for me--is the real reason to order this dish. I would love to have a bowl of those candied kumquats and bowl of toasted mixed nuts. With a drink, of course.Not quite full, but not needing any more meat, I ordered Wild Mushroom Cassoulet, one of only two vegetarian options. (The other is a risotto with saffron.) I also asked for a glass of Bordeaux. This dish was mildly disappointing. The flavors were very good, but it's size was about the same as my starters. I'll admit that the quantity was fine after polishing off three starters, but I was expecting more of an entree size. Adding to the disappointment was the dry state of some of the mushrooms. They were obviously oven-roasted, which is great for flavor, but the kitchen left them dry and a little leathery. The final disappointment are chunks of what I think were pork shoulder. There is soy sausage in this dish, but I know meat fibers when I bite into them. When I showed the server a chunk of the meat (I even pulled it apart to help identify it being meat), she was apologetic and can't imagine how that happened.In the end, I was satisfied and not too full, so I skipped dessert.Bonus: Perch has a rooftop bar. A mellow space compared to the hustle and bustle of the main bar downstairs. Of course, being on the roof and outside, I suppose most visitors of that bar are spending their energy keeping warm.

It's more like simple french inspired comfort food - and they could probably do well to simplify the menu and let the food speak for itself. I was underwhelmed with the presentation of the dishes that came based on the descriptions from the menu. It was pretty hit or miss, the fondu dish wasn't fondu like at all. I was impressed with the flavors in the rabbit dish, and the coq au vin nuggets. I really like that they offer frogs legs, rabbit, bone marrow and other such adventurous dishes, for the price range. The menu needs tuning up and it needs to be presented more humbly, so as to wow people when the food arrives, not the opposite way around. Unfortunately the entire experience was ruined by the fact that the bone marrow dish contained a garnish that was drenched in truffle oil and salt. I had one mouthful that was so gratuitously salty it almost made me throw up and I had to spit it out. I mean, I literally had a mouthful of pure salt. It was nasty. Truffle oil is a completely unnecessary ingredient that is a poor substitue for real truffles, and is a sign of an amateur chef.

The server, who never told us her name was very slow; didn't bring out a dish we ordered. The wine showed up 5 minutes after our food. One of the dishes we ordered was completely different from when we ordered it before And the server said they were running low on cheese so she guessed the kitchen took it upon themselves to replace cheese with more meat. She didn't save our table or tell her staff that we were going to have a cigarette on the side even though she told us we could do so. My girlfriend's shawl was take from the table by a staff member. Then after I had that returned, another staff member moved our untouched desert that had been served while we having a cigarette, to use our table to set up a bigger table. How is it that a restaurant with such a good rep could have such poor communication between staff members? I've worked at restaurants most if my adult life and I know it's not difficult to tell your busser or hosts that the guests will be right back to the table. Then when the staff member realizes what she had done to our table, she sets it back up and we sit down to our desert with no plates, no napkin, no water. Our server stops by seemingly oblivious to our needs and we asked for plates, There's no way she didn't realize what had just happened but she didn't apologize (she wore a stupid bowtie so fare warning, if you get her, don't expect a good night).

Should be for 1 person max. It was good, but a tease! We had an arugula salad to start, chicken stuffed with pesto with potatoes and chocolate pudding with fresh berries. Salad was ok. Chicken was good, but not the best. Our friend seated next to me quickly asked for salt and pepper. The portion was actually bigger than we expected. (we seriously already planned to hit up del taco or jack in the box afterwards in case we weren't full) My son had burger sliders and fries and some guests jokingly wished they got his meal. The fries came with some great garlic sauce that tasted like the one from Zankou Chicken, so I used it on my chicken and potatoes!! lucky me! We had a 1y & 3 year old in our party and they loved it out there and looking through the glass. It's not a kid friendly place, but since we had a reserved section and it was a wedding party we took them and they were very accommodating. They even had the high chairs ready! So they DO have highchairs which is good hahah. Overall everyone had a great time! (and a lot of drinks) It's a nice place to consider having a big dinner party if you are willing to pay a lot. It had that nice wow factor for guests. We left around 9 and it was packed. Glad we got to try for free. I suggest going to happy hour to get a better deal on drinks and food since it's pricey.

Hostess tells us it's an hour wait and we can have a drink at the bar in the meanwhile. We agree, have a glass of wine each and the wait ends up being closer to 20-30 minutes. We are asked to close the tab at the bar, then are walked over to our table. I notice there is a piece of cork in my glass. I look around and find an employee ( man with silver shoes) nearby and tell him about it. He tells me I should get up and go tell the bar about it so they can change it. I don't feel like getting up so I just pull out the piece of cork myself and ignore the incident. We wait around for AT LEAST 20 minutes before the server comes. Asks us what we want before having brought menus, and when ordering a second round of wine, we indicate we want a different type, and she asks which one. In my head I think \"I don't have the menu memorized! I don't know\" but instead kindly ask to see the wine list to make my selection. Long story short, there is a lot of waiting. We could not find her to get our check so I instead get up and ask the bartender (super nice guy) to direct me to the manager. I share with him the various details of our experience and he was EXTREMELY courteous, apologetic, and grateful for the feedback.

THEY DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF CUSTOMER SERVICE! It was my friend's birthday and there were 11 of us out celebrating. None of us had ever been to Perch before. It looked like a great, upscale place to celebrate so we went. We soon regretted it. A few of us had been upstairs already and we came down to find our friends as we took four different cars to get there. We we first arrived there was no one at the front door. When we attempted to back inside one of the bouncers who was just upstairs was outside with this really tall, thin, incredibly rude \"hostess.\" We walked right by her as we did not know who she was, nor did she present herself as someone who needed us to stop off and check in with. There was no line to get in or any indication that I needed to check in with someone before entering. I was the first one who walked by her. She asked me where I was going and I advised her \u00a0\"to Perch.\" She twisted her face in a rather stuck up was and said \"Um can you come back here please?\" So much attitude was presented it was ridiculous. So I obliged her and returned to the front door. Then she stated, \"I need to see your ID, in fact, I need to see all of your IDs.\" Please keep in mind- I am in my low 40's and my friends were also no where near 21. While I have been told I look 35 by lots of lovely people, I know there is no way that I look younger than 21 nor did any of my friends \"if you are reading this- sorry guys\" I looked at her like you have to be F---king kidding me! The bouncer looked at me and advised her that we had just come downstairs and to let us back up. We go upstairs to the 16th floor. We wait in line for 40 minutes before getting to the front of the line for the \"mixologists\" to work their magic. By the time I got to the front of the line- I was like screw this-I am ordering 2 drinks because there is no way I am waiting in this line for another 40 minutes. I order a shot of Kettle One and a Kettle One and Cranberry. The mixologist made the Kettle One and Cranberry and then sits a glass on the counter for the shot. I see very clearly that there is lipstick on this glass and don't say anything at first as I figure as slow as she is moving she has to see this. In the time it took her to make the drink and prepare the shot I could have made four drinks- no wonder it took so long for me to get to the front of the line. Anyway, She is about to pour this shot into the dirty glass and I stop her and say \"You aren't going to pour that in that glass are you?\" She rolls her eyes- yes I said rolls her eyes and says to me \"Well, what would you like me to put it in?\" I reply to her \"A glass with no lipstick on it please.\" She then removes the snotty how dare you question me look from her face and gets another glass. She never apologized or anything! The lounge area sucked as well. There were only a few couches out with a fire pit and one other heater- My friends and had to stand the whole time we were there and we froze our butts off. The people on the roof top were complete snobs. Other than the snobs I could not believe the complete lack of any kind of service at this place! This is supposed to be upscale? I think not. If you want to pay for someone to treat you like crap- Then this is your place.

That would be amazing!!! But for time being, Perch will do. Great place to bring a date, I've had many heart to hearts leaning over the glass railing on the upstairs deck. There's something about heights that gives people an added sense of freedom and curiosity. If you're like me, when you're on a date, you want to really find the substance of the person. Not necessarily on the 1st date, you don't want to get too deep too fast, just something about having that dialogue bridge the gap between silly fun, and real life wishes, desires, and dreams. There's something about the feeling of being up high that liberates the spirit, and removes the hindrances of our own imagination. When you are free to think, free to dream, you can really start conveying your heart in a more meaningful way, which leads to more sustainable intimacy. Plus it's a great place to keep your date warm with the gentle and strong embrace of your arms and chest.

I was there last night to celebrate my birthday and whoa!! I must say! My party of about 30 loved the place! It's a gem in downtown. Because I had such a great experience, I decided to write this review.. (Yes! My very first review). I had dinner reservations at 830 for 12 people and then about 25-30 people were going to trickle in for drinks on the top level after. \u00a0Tina who I spoke with a week ago suggested that in order for me to avoid the $1000 deposit, I should reserve dinner for 12 instead of 20. \u00a0Totally loved that she suggested that! So we arrive around 835-840 and sat us in a private area just for my party! =) I went to the 16th floor \u00a0with balloons to reserve a space and when I got there, it was packed! The bouncer Tim, called Tina to come and in less than 5 minutes she was there =) She told me that there was another party of 30 there and that I should have arrived much earlier to reserve but I told her I wanted to be considerate that I was not taking up space since my guests were not arriving till 10pm. It seemed like her hands were tied at this point.. but she said \"let me check!\" \u00a0Then, Tim got a message on his earpiece that I can still have my party up there. \u00a0Tim was amazing he told me that he would take care of everything and even put reserve signs!! Then i was off to attend to my dinner guests. On my way down, Tina met with me again, and she was kind enough to tell me not to worry because she took care of everything for me.. AMAZING I say!  The food took forever!! A little pricey but it's worth every penny! I must say that they kept serving us bread and butter to make up for the lateness but it was worth the wait! \u00a0I had the Beignets and it was fresh and scrumptious! Tasted a little of my friend's veggie risotto and again it was mouth watering! The Lamb burger looked amazing! The endless fresh bread with butter and olive tapenade \u00a0was ooh lala!! And the drinks, oh wow! Great prices!! After about an hour, my 10pm drink guests were starting to trickle in and we were still not served our dinners! \u00a0So all my guests were sporadically located. \u00a0I went back up to apologize to Tim for our tardiness and explained that we've been waiting for food. \u00a0He was soooo nice and said just come and ill will take care of your party!!! TIM IS AWESOME!!! So why the 4 stars? 1/2 a star for the time it took to serve the food. \u00a0Another 1/2 was for our server (who was having a bad day because of shitty customers who were sitting next to us, but still..) HE was not too friendly. \u00a0Although he did put one of my drinks on the house.. he could have been nicer/friendlier. \u00a0Aside from that, the night was a success! The place is new and you can tell that they are still ironing a few kinks (like every business would during their first couple of months), but with the rate of how they're going, PERCH will definitely be one of DT's greater restaurant/bars! \u00a0And again, thank you to Tina and Tim ..

They forgot to give us bread, which wouldn't have been such an issue had the food not taken an hour to arrive. We ordered the asparagus salad, the steak frites and the Beouf pot au feu. The salad was nothing special. The steak frites came with frites with truffle oil but they were completely soggy and while they tasted fine, they really were a nasty texture. The pot au feu was nice, the horseradish mashed potatoes were STRONG and the peas were super dry, most defiantly frozen.

Their ingredients just did not blend well and I forgot if there was any dressing at all, as it was just so dry.The rest of the food was just as bad. The lobster bisque was devoid of even a single piece of lobster and was like watered down milk with an orange coloring. The chicken was dry. The ribs my friend had were bland. The only decent dishes were the fish. The Escolar I had was fresh and cooked perfectly and another friend said his Salmon was decent.Even the drinks were poorly made. The two mojitos we had were not mixed right (they took them back and did not charge us). We even complained to the manager about the slow service and lack of appetizers. She promised us free desserts and coffee. When the bill came they only gave us 50% off the desserts and charged us for the coffee.

If you want to have dinner the food is not too bad but good luck getting a table at a convenient time, the food is the only reason I gave it a star. Most people rave about the roof top lounge which is cool but already exists all over DownTown and Hollywood. The problem with this place is the service, access, and organization. The servers are all gorgeous and nice but don't have a clue about capacity and hosting. The bouncers are rude, young, inexperienced, and obviously there is an issue with the elevators. The part that turned me off and actually caused me to leave midway between my friends birthday was the bartenders, especially the gentlemen who bartends on the roof top. The bartenders lay out olives, cucumbers and other drink topings RIGHT INFRONT of you. There is no sign to not touch or for bartender use only, its literally RIGHT THERE... so my friend wanted an olive and as usual they are so overpacked and busy my friend will have to wait 10 years before they notice him for his freaking olive so he reaches half a foot forward and takes an olive thinking hey they are for the customer, me , I paid I want a damn olive... all of a sudden the bartender yells HEY what are you doing, thats disgusting don't use your hands use a toothpick! why are you taking olives?!!!! he freaks out on my friend and keeps insulting him calling directly DISGUSTING... my friend trys to explain but he keeps on insulting until my friend fires back with a warning and then security comes and man handles my friend kicks him out. OVER AN OLIVE! The same thing happened to 3 of my girl friends at the same night over a cucumber at the bar. Rude and stupid staff. Good luck staying open. Never again for drinks or parties.
