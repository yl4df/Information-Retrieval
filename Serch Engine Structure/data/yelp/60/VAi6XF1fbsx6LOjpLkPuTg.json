Being in a burger kind of mood and having read that this place is listed as one of LA's best burger joints, we decided to check it out. It's pretty small, diner style and there is no waiting list or a hostess - if there is an open space, you sit, if there isn't - you wait for an open seat and swoop in. So, maybe not a place with a large party of people - that will be chaos.The main event - burgers - did not disappoint. I ordered hickory burger and it was pretty simple in a classic kind of way, with \"secret\" smoky sauce and delicious, fiance ordered steak burger and by happy grunts and slurps, I will judge that it was too, delicious! I can definitely see why this restaurant made the list of best burgers in LA. I want to touch on the subject of pies, though, as this was an area of slight disappointment. Every reviewer pretty much raved about amaaaazing pies and I am not one to skip a good dessert. It was a bit underwhelming for the amount of expectation that I had. Ordered an apple pie with ice cream - it was OK, not the best apple pie I had by far. If anything, it was a bit bland. I definitely did not think it's $8 per slice amazing. I fully understand higher prices due to location and a huge supporter of local businesses, but c'mon - a slice of normal \"no thrills\" apple pie and a scoop of regular vanilla ice cream for $8 - no way! 2 burgers, 1 iced tea, 1 fry, 2 pies ended up being $40 bucks. Overall, conflicting experience. Was the food delicious? Yes! Is the hassle of finding a parking (their parking lot is ridiculously tiny), disorganized waiting to get a seat, cash only, on top of pretty steep pricing for slightly elevated diner food worth your time?

He also gave us wet napkins (I think it was like the moist towelettes?)The steakburger was delicious, and so was the hickory burger! The apple pie was to die for. Really yummy.

If you don't like burgers made american style, then go to Umami. (Excellent burgers at Umami for $14, and a lot of beef.) AP is about a sandwich experience. There is a lot of lettuce, a lot of cheese, sauce, and then some beef. The beef is not bigger than the cheese, and that is how a sandwich should be. You are tasting different flavors. If you want to taste delicious beef, shell out the $14 at Umami, or the $17 at Father's Office. Both excellent. But if you want the Bob's Big Boy style burger, AP is the best!!!! (They don't do the triple-decker burgers here though.)The haters are looking for something like Father's Office, or even across from AP at Westside Tavern, which has a delicious cheeseburger for $15. \u00a0But AP is the best at what it does.Now on to the pies. the AP's \u00a0Banana Cream Pie is all bananas and a little pudding and cream. Whereas the traditional american-style banana cream elsewhere is just a banana pudding with whip cream on top. \u00a0At AP, it's a PILE of bananas. (Sort of like the strawberry pie you sometimes find with a big stack of strawberries in a sugar glaze, and no pudding.)The apple pie is runny under the crust, and not the dry kind. They also have a glaze they pour on to it. \u00a0The best way to try apple pie here is with whip cream. Why? Because it is hand whipped and it blows away any ice cream you've had. TRY IT. \u00a0Apple pie and whipped cream. mmmm. \u00a0(For the old timers they also offer cheddar on top of you apple pie. Ew!.)AP is the best in the West at what they do. And I freely admit that Umami is great, Father's Office is awesome and Westside Tavern is too. Even \"The Six\" down the street makes a good burger. But AP is the only traditional old-school american burger where it's not about the thick fat patty of beef, but about the layering of cheese, lettuce, and hickory sauce.", "Date": "2014-07-03", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Derek K.", "ReviewID": "HE9MCY5wpy8FInnqXBuwKg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Often cited as the most historical burger joint in LA, The Apple Pan has been in business since 1947 and is still running strong, retaining its original American diner ambience, right down to the old-style cash registers propped on both sides of the U-shaped seating ring. In fact, I'd say that the only palpable change since the 40's is the prices.And changed they have. I'll venture a guess that a burger did not cost $8 + tax/tip in the 40's. And after trying their renowned Hickory Burger (the BBQ-tinged alternative to the standard burger), I can't say that its current (2014) prices are justifiable.**Meal Breakdown - Hickory Burger and Fries**The bread is nice and firm, allowing the burger to retain its shape throughout the meal. The meat is decent; somewhat juicy, but not really thick enough to allow you to enjoy its true meatiness. They load the things up with iceberg lettuce, which ends up being responsible for most of its volume. The hickory sauce has an old-timey American BBQ feel to it. The fries are crisp and potato-ey, and I'd argue are better fries than the burger is a burger.**Let's Talk Pie**I can't finish a meal here without eating the pie. They have 4 varieties: Apple, Banana Cream, Pecan, and Pumpkin, and all varieties use original recipes from as early as the mid-1800s. An admirable concept, but sometimes change is good. Surprisingly, the namesake Apple Pie is not the best of the four. It tastes homely, the kind of thing you'd expect your great-grandma to pull out of her oven, but is very runny and inevitably falls apart. It is a lot more apple-y than it is sweet.The star of the show is the Banana Cream Pie. The custard blends right into the natural creaminess of the banana slices, and is further complemented, in ideal ratio, by the whipped cream on top. The crust is firmer than the Apple, meaning you can actually enjoy the same consistency throughout. Despite the diner's name, overall, the Banana Pie is designed better.**Experience**Service is rushed. The wait staff always has this condescending \"yeah you're welcome\" kind of attitude. There's often a wait but no one taking names, meaning customers fend for themselves as far as seating order, potentially escalating into a chaotic free-for-all. It's cash only, and with the $8 burgers, fries, and a couple of sodas and pie, you may be looking at a decent-size bill.The Apple Pan is good for the novelty and for enjoying its nostalgic 1940's ambience. It might be cool to try if that's what you're looking for, but sadly, the food alone is not worth the prices, perhaps with the exception of the Banana Pie.Final rating is a 2.5, with an optional half-a-star if you're here for the ambience.", "Date": "2014-06-19", "Author_Location": "Torrance, CA"}, {"Author": "Bethany D.", "ReviewID": "4NV_h0j4v-sJ_j7R2TH6wA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hate going anywhere on Pico. I mean, I can't tell you how much. Traffic sucks, people suck, parking sucks, drivers suck. On more than one occasion, I've seen idiot drivers DRIVE IN REVERSE on Pico in the middle of rush hour to get a parking spot. Morons. So you'll understand my level of commitment to a restaurant in order to go over there. This commitment is what drove me to Apple Pan. If you want a traditional, classic burger, this is the place to go. I don't have time for your fancy, frilly, trendy, hipster, skinny jeans, artisan burger places. I really don't. They're all right if you want to see just how much nouveau riche acoutrements you can add to your burger to try and pretend that it is something more bourgeois than what it was ever intended. As for me, I'm a burger classicalist, and even the fact that such a definition exists is irksome. But I digress. When you arrive, if you're lucky enough to get a parking spot in their tiny parking lot in back, you walk through a little pathway that looks like a side yard to someone's house to get to the front door. Once you're inside, all you see is a U-shaped lunch counter, 2 very old fashioned registers (I don't think any of the buttons actually work on either of them), and a grill on the other side of the counter. There's no air conditioning, no music, no jukebox. Just a classic throwback to the time when you wanted a burger and didn't need to be entertained with the latest, hippest trends. The menu is hardly extensive. Two kinds of burgers, fries, a few other sandwiches, and pies. It's not complex. I ordered the steak burger, no lettuce, relish and mayo. When it was set before me, swaddled in it's old fashioned white paper, I was rather taken aback at the absence of a plate. But then I thought about it for a second. What in the hell do I need a damn plate for? I came here for the burger, not a plate! The burger was cooked to perfection. The Tillamook cheese had a perfect melty substance, and the relish was just the right amount. The fries were served in a little cardboard container, and the guy behind the counter kept pouring out the ketchup for me in a little cardboard dish. Everything was absolutely as fresh as can be! The burger was not massive in size but was extraordinarily filling, which tells me that they don't cut the meat mixture with a lot of filler crap in order to cut costs. Win!On the back of the menu, there is a little information on the recipes they use for their burgers and pies. Turns out that they are old family recipes dating back to the 1800's. The banana cream pie dates back to the 1850s! I thought that was pretty impressive so I ordered myself a slice. It was not a very practical thing to do, but I figured that since I made the sojourn to Pico in the first place, I would by God have some pie. I wondered whether or not it would be worth the sheer agony that I knew I would suffer after eating it since I was already so full. The answer.... a resounding YES!!! This was literally the best banana cream pie I'd ever eaten. Fresh, creamy bananas, custard, and fresh cream. To be honest, I haven't even seen a banana cream pie that looks similar to theirs! Most of the complaints I've seen on Yelp concern the \"rude\" waiters and the price. I can definitely understand why it may come across as a negative, so I will do my best to explain (or, at least, what it seems like to me). Rude waiters: The Apple Pan is a notoriously busy place. There isn't a lot of room in there, and there's always someone jonesing for a seat at the counter. If you sit down, and you tell the waiter that you know what you're going to have, it's a real d!ckhead move to not know. Like I said, the menu is NOT extensive or complicated. There's about 7 items on there, MAX. I heard some douche a few chairs down from me trying to order. \"Yeah....... uhhhhh... I'm going to have the.... uhhh..... hmmm..... Well.... hmmmmm.... I think... You know what? I.... hmmmm..... no.....\" If this is what you do, you're an ass-hat and you deserve to get treated as such. Prices: I admit it, the prices are steep. I had a Steakburger, fries, a Diet Coke, and a slice of pie. Total was $20.25. While the place is old fashioned and vintage, the prices are not. That bummed me out a bit but then I got to thinking. The area around here is EXPENSIVE!!!! Rent prices are INSANE. I don't know if the owners of the Apple Pan actually own their plot of land, but my guess is that they don't. In order for a small hamburger shop to keep up with the escalating rent hikes in that area, they HAVE to charge that much to the customers. It sucks, but it doesn't seem like it can be helped. TL;DR: I can absolutely understand why Apple Pan is renowned for being the best burger joint in L.A. I don't know if I have a hands down favorite, but Apple Pan is definitely in my top 5.

Bottom line is, there are far better experiences on the West Side than this.I had heard about the Apple Pan for a while as a return to the days of the classic burger counter. I love old timey nostalgic themes like that so I was excited when my gf and I decided to come here for lunch. We came in around 1pm and the place was expectedly busy. We had to wait a bit but got two seats quicker than we expected which was nice. When we sat down the guy behind the counter immediately started grilling us (there is a burger pun here somewhere) for our order. I just asked for a coke which he handed me as a can, paper cone full of ice, and some weird metal stand for the cone which looks like the fancy thing that rich people eat deviled eggs out of. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, just wasteful I suppose.As soon as he handed us our drinks, we hadn't even begun to look at the menu, but he asked for our order. We said we are still deciding and he said ok, and that he would come back in 5 seconds. He was basically trying to rush us along. I understand it was busy, but I at the very least want some time to understand what I am ordering before I order it.We finally placed our order, so this is a good time to talk about the decor. Again, I get it. This is supposed to be classic and nostalgic. It is meant to feel like an old time burger bar. Not at all. This place is just old and ugly. There is nothing good feeling about it. Its not even like one of those restaurants where it is so bad its good looking like a 50's style diner place. Its just plain bad.All of that was still not enough to warrant 2 stars for me because I am generous reviewer. What was really the last straw for me was the food. I ordered the steak burger sans mayo and my gf had the hickory burger. I figured that since this plane is known for their awesome, amazing burgers, these would be life changing. This is definitely not the case. The beef is flavorless which probably means its bought frozen, not fresh. The bun is nothing special either. The burger itself is almost all sauce. They clearly have over sauced everything to make up for their flavorless meat. I thought this was a fluke but my gf's burger was drowned in ketchup and mayo. Mine was overpowered with the flavor of the sweet relish. Consequentially, my hands were also drowned in that relish. The fries were the saving grace because they were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. They did one thing right.Lastly, when it came time to pay, we got the bill but couldn't read it. I asked the server what the second number was. He takes the bill, re-does all the math and adds to the charge. We end up paying way more than we should have. Also, for any business out there being stubborn about accepting cash, get over yourself. You are losing customers who are increasingly NOT CARRYING CASH. Eat the 3-5% credit card fee. If that is going to ruin your business then you are doing it wrong.Please avoid the Apple Pan.

Everything is outdated to preserve its classic retro theme. It's also tiny inside and counter seating only. When we arrived, the place was packed. There was no hostess to greet us or take our name. We had to stand behind the people sitting at the counter and wait for them to finish. Luckily, a few seats soon became available and we quickly jump at the opportunity. The menu was small and cash only. We ordered the steak and hickory burger with a side of fries. While the burgers were good, it surely wasn't the best. A better description would be \"decent and satisfying\". \u00a0We actually preferred the hickory over the steak which was more flavorful. The portions were definitely a bit overpriced, especially $7 per burger. The highlight for me was the slice of apple pie ala mode.

The place certainly had the nostalgic feel to it with the punch cash registers, the drinks served in cones and the white shirts and hats of the employees.The menu is simple - burgers, sandwiches, fries, pies and drinks. I went with the hickory burger with cheese, fries and a slice of banana cream pie. The hickory burger had an interesting smoky flavor but there was just way too much sauce on the burger, too much lettuce and mayo when I specifically requested mine without It. The only thing that was in short supply was the actual meat! The patty was so thin. For $7.10 + .50 for cheese, that was almost a joke. The fries really had no seasoning. They were crispy but not good.The best thing about my meal was the banana cream pie. The whipped cream was perfectly sweetened, the pudding was tasty, the bananas were fresh and the crust was flaky and light. For $6.25, I may be able to justify that. Overall though, for over $17, the Apple Pan just wasn't my kind of place. I can't imagine ever craving anything from there. Well, I satisfied my curiosity. Now...I'm off to actually find a good burger in LA.", "Date": "2014-02-09", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Evan L.", "ReviewID": "mgEbcYQVM6DxCSdo10HC0g", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Parents have been taking me here since I was a little kid and Ive always loved the experience.

Hickory Burger ($7.10)- This burger is the same exact replica of the one above and had the same problems with its proportions!... but the difference is in the sauce. \u00a0The steakburger has a mild sweet pickle relish, whereas the hickory burger has a thick audacious tangy one. Out of the two, I enjoyed this one a little more, but as I've said before, I'd probably grab In N out instead.Fries (2.60)- Daily made fresh fries that were crispy and fluffy on the inside. Good!Banana Cream Pie, Blueberry Pie, Apple Pie (6.25/each slice)- Each were big in size and served with a side of ice cream. They were good! But Id say its comparable to Marie Calendars. ----Conclusion: 2.5 stars. The only reason this place is popular has to be due to the long history of it all. \u00a0In this day and age, where aggressive, exciting tastes are blended into burgers, Apple Pan is left in the dust...and seems content with that. \u00a0Maybe they still attract customers who appreciate the old-school feel, but I won't be back a third time.Extra Notes:-CASH ONLY-Extremely friendly, fast service-Parking is a challenge, strict enforcement too!-Old school Decor-Restroom available", "Date": "2014-01-13", "Author_Location": "Huntington Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Brian O.", "ReviewID": "tAhgcjLJb99Qr4_JMxqprw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Way overpriced!

All bar seating, paper cups, servers pouring your ketchup for you, no substitutions- the whole setup is like walking back in time and is all a part of the experience.My choice order is a hickory burger with cheese, orange crush, fries and a piece of banana cream pie. You will seriously be cheating yourself if you don't order a piece of pie so plan accordingly and maybe don't pig out on fries.

This was my second time eating here, and it was just okay for me. The nostalgia of the place is what makes it somewhat fun, but the rude service really takes away from any ambiance it has. Since there is only seating at the counter, and it's usually always busy, you have to be prepared to feel very stressed out throughout your entire dining experience. My hubby and I both ordered the hickory burger. We split an order of fries, and we each got creme sodas. The sodas were tasty, and the paper cone cup inside the holder is kind of different and neat. The fries, however, were very overcooked and didn't impress me at all. The burger was slathered in sauce! It was just too much sauce for me, and didn't really have the smoky hickory flavor I was expecting. The gentleman who served us seemed more annoyed that anything to be working there, having to serve us, and acted like we had ruined his day by coming in! No such thing as service with a smile here! He slammed our burgers over to us when they were ready, and even when we tried to say a polite \"thank you\", he didn't seem to care or respond. I got the feeling that he felt very anxious/overworked and did not have the time to be polite or kind. It also felt stressful knowing there was a line of people literally standing behind us waiting to get a seat at the counter and order. Not a very peaceful, relaxing meal at all! It is also very overpriced for what you get, especially with the service being so poor. The only regret I have is that we didn't order the pie, but the servers literally make you feel like you're putting them out by having to serve you, so it was tough to imagine staying long enough for dessert when you're met with that mentality. At the very end, he asked if I wanted a \"to-go\" cup for my drink, which I thought was his one kind gesture. Afterward, my husband informed me that he was not trying to be nice, but merely trying to get us to leave faster by offering the to-go cup. I can have a much tastier, cheaper meal in a much less stressful environment. This place is just not worth it. They should get some nicer staff and more seating and then maybe I would try it again.", "Date": "2013-11-17", "Author_Location": "Anaheim, CA"}, {"Author": "Samuel K.", "ReviewID": "_JACpMyjLuD1zhytQ5ks4w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It was my first time and I loved the place! It is a nice old-school diner with a very simple menu. Enough with the pleasantries and let's jump right into the pros/cons/recommendations:Pros: The food is very cheap ($7.10 for a burger, $2.60 for fries, and $1.75 for a soft drink). The diner has a very comfortable and cozy old-school ambience. It takes very little time to order, get your food, and get out of there. They have these famous pies that are delicious (Apple pie/Pecan pie). Cons: The parking lot is very small. Due to the size of the diner, the seating is very limited (not recommended for groups bigger than 3-4). Their pies are very popular and tend to sell out during the day. Speaking of pies, a slice is $6 (I know, expensive right?) but they are darn good. Recommendation: Hickoryburger (seems to be a lot more popular than their Steakburger), french fries (nothing too special about them but are good, not great), and a slice of Apple pie (when I went, they were already sold out of Apple pie so had to settle for Pecan pie; Pecan pie was still very delicious)Random observations: Unique way of serving soda (in a paper cone with ice).

It was just kinda awkward cause you have a whole line of people just waiting to pounce on a seat. We sat down after about 20 minutes of waiting and looked at the menu to see only a handful of burger selections. In fact the only difference between the two main burgers was the sauce, but we still rolled with it. The burgers were nothing special at all, as my friend said, \"you could get a six dollar burger at Carl's Jr. and it'd be the same thing.\" I just think this place is too hyped up and there are DEFINITELY way more burger joints that deserve to be the top ones in LA.

The venue is more authentically nostalgic than any other wannabe mid-century diner (Johnny Rockets et al). And it has an incredibly pungent smell of grease - likely decades worth - that you just have to get used to.My lady friend knew the drill here for seating, and I was also warned by fellow yelpers to ask for light lettuce and well done fries.Incredibly efficient service for one guy serving a dozen and a half parties. Come to think of it, the seating was like Noah's ark: everyone came in pairs.My accomplice also commented on the fact that the quality of the burger is dependent on who is manning the grill that evening. Some may be scared at the prospects of parity and inconsistency, but I am always relieved when food-quality is dependent on the cooking itself. It means it's the real deal and not pre-packaged (and Chipotle even counts in this regard; ever notice some Chipotle's are better than others?).The hickory burger came out exactly as it was foretold: small. The meat patty (I'd estimated net weight to be 3 oz) quality was a notch above fast food but nothing higher. The hickory sauce was over-powering to me - it eliminated all other savory flavors, from the pickles to the cheese to the mayo. The well-done fries came out splendidly, even if they were salt-less (no dice trying to pour table salt on these guys, it just wouldn't stick), and the iced tea was exceptional. They ran out of every pie except pecan. I wonder if you can order a burger with double patties?You'd think you wouldn't be able to have a private conversation because of the stool setup, but surprisingly you can. And I felt no rush in my meal from the onlooking horde waiting for a coveted spot. Perhaps I'm just impolite?Overall, I would recommend this place for a friend coming into town wanting to eat at historical landmarks (alongside Langer's and unfortunately Pinks).

Either way, this was my first time actually coming here and sitting down. I was first taken aback by the diner style that is reminiscent of Johnny Rockets. I was expecting more of a sit down restaurant. Despite the Johnny Rockets style, this is a bit different. They offer 2 different types of burgers (Steakburger and Hickory Burger). Both of them are around $7 for single patty burgers. Let me just say that when you pay $7 for their burger, you're paying mostly for the location. The burger definitely isn't worth that much because it's probably the size of a Habit sized burger or a little bigger than in n out. The meat is good and the flavors aren't bad, but it definitely didn't rock my world. The fries were $2.50ish I think and were ok. They needed more salt so don't be afraid to reach for that shaker. The biggest redeeming factor is the banana cream pie. An awesome pie with a hell of a lot of bananas. Would I come back?

After Living in LA for the better part of nine months, I woke up one morning and shuffled over to the mirror and looked at myself and said \" yeesh, girl. What have you been doing with yourself? How can you say you live here? You are a fraud.\" And shortly after that harrowing moment decided it was time for a milestone in every Yelper's career- a trip to zeee Apple Pan.If you are reading this review you probably already know what's up The Apple Pan but in case you don't, here's the scoop: The Apple Pan is nostalgic burger and pie shack nestled in the heart of west LA; it's an eater 38 staple and a foodie favorite renowned for it's homey feel, hickory burgers and fresh banana cream pie. Apple Pan is a \"come for the klout stay for the food\" kinda joint.let's grab a nibble!Getting a seat at the Apple pan is notoriously nightmarish and my trip here was no exception. I came alone around 7:30 around on a Sunday night but the fight to get one seat at the counter was still difficult. There isn't really a line and people can get kind of mean about getting a seat. If you a trying to come here with your family of twelve (or even five) I would suggest considering another option because there will probably be tears and maybe even blood. I have pepper spray so I am one of the luckier ones. The service is quick and straight to the point. This is not a restaurant to lounge and take in the ambiance and the service here makes that pretty clear.And the food. The menu is super simple. Although I've been on the receiving end of many break ups with the line \" you know, you are making things TOO complicated\" I decided to go against what is apparently my typical behavior and hold true to Apple Pan's menu and keep my order simple- that being said, I got the much touted hickory burger and an order of fries. The fries were brought out before the burger ( weeee! An appteaser) and they were seriously mediocre. The portion was generous and could be easily split between two people but that did make up for the fact that they were pretty flavorless. Alls I'm going to say is I've had better fries at McDonalds. After a few minutes of nibbling and noshing the burger was brought out. Hello meaty treat! \u00a0Although I may get strangled in my sleep for saying this, I found the hickory burger to be largely reminiscent to the sloppy joes of my summer camp years ( which is actually great because I always returned from camp svelte and giggly). I found the meat to crumbly and fresh tasting but the sheer volume of sauce was overpowering and left the burger a huge mess.  My biggest regret was skipping out on the pie. Although I found the burger and fries to be pretty mediocre, I may need to make a trek back for that darn tootin pie. Including tip my meal was around twelve bucks. For the quality of the food I got, the price was high but the guys at The Apple Pan knows what's up. People are going to come regardless of the cost. Also, in case you haven't already read from the four zillion other reviews, it's cash only.If you're a foodie, want to see it all and have patience that rivals that of a seventh grade math teacher, Apple Pan deserves a spot on your list but if that doesn't sound like you I'd suggest a trip to in-n-out.", "Date": "2013-09-18", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Kez C.", "ReviewID": "FBTO8UML9oqCs74vbUzNGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love this spot, only discovered it recently so have only been once.Ran and owned by some cool old guys, when u sit down, ur orders are taken within seconds and ur eating within minutes!Enjoyed my burger & fries, but the apple pie is where it's at haha!

Now I'm comparing Apple Pan's Hickory burger to Slatter's 50/50, Prohibition burger, The Fix, Umami, Father's Office, Counter Burger and Pono burger to name a few, so it already has stiff competition. The place is quaint, with bar stools and you have to eat at the counter. Plus it's cash only, so don't forget cash before you go. The soft drinks are served in snowcone cones and the fries are decent but are definitely not worth $2.60. The burger itself comes with way to much ketchup and lettuce. I had to remove half just so I could taste the hickory flavor. Overall I'd give the burger a 6 out of 10. The quality doesn't justify the price. 2 burgers with cheese, 2 fries, 2 cans of soda and 1 slice of pie cost $40 with tip.

Within less than five minutes, our fries and drinks materialized. And within less than 10 minutes, we all had our burgers! I'm sure that this breakneck pace is pretty standard for them when it gets busy, and they do a great job. Unfortunately, the hype to me seems undeserved. The ratio of hamburger patty to fixin's was very uneven--the lettuce, for example, was twice the size of the burger patty. The amount of sauce was gratuitous, and I could barely taste the beef. When I could, the flavor was on par with an In-n-Out burger--but cost $5 more. The fries are standard and nothing to write home about--while well-fried and crispy, I didn't think they were significantly better than the Ore-Ida fries you can buy frozen at a grocery store. And the pies... after reading rave reviews about the banana cream pie and the (namesake?) apple pie, I was excited. I bake a lot of pies at home and was looking forward to these traditional recipes, handed down from one generation to the next. But what I tasted in both was standard, and nothing that would elevate them a cut above the rest. Don't get me wrong--the pies are solid and taste good. But they're not GREAT. I am disappoint. :(With tax and tip, the total came out to ~ $20 for each of us--and I didn't think it was worth it, to be honest.

There was no wait. My two roommates and I were seated immediately at the restaurant's bar-style counter. The guy behind the counter \"waiting\" on people came over and just said, \"Yes.\"Not really sure what to do, we asked for three waters and then looked at the menu. The menu is about as extensive as a kindergarten teacher's lesson plan. A couple burgers; a couple sandwiches, and PIE. I ordered the Hickory Burger and fries. The burger was EXTREMELY underwhelming, but the fries were great. It was a plane old burger. I don't get what the hype is about? - the fries were something special, though. Throughout the whole meal, I had a window seat staring right into the area where they make the pie. OBVIOUSLY I had to have a piece. I had a piece of pecan with a scoop of ice cream. I had to. I had to. The pie was delicious. Hot, crunchy, and the perfect amount of pecans. We then got the bill. 60 bucks for three people. Not including the tip. It rounded out to $23 per person. I feel that's a little steep for a sub-par burger, fries, and a piece of pie. Of course this place is living in a time machine and only accepts cash. So, I hightailed it over to the conveniently placed Wells Fargo across the street and pulled money out of my savings account to cover the ridiculous bill. That was student loan money. Thanks, Apple Pan. The Apple Pan was simply a disappointment. I will probably never go back. The food was decent, the atmosphere was cool, and the service was funny.

You can buy a whole apple pie at Trader Joe's for this price for similar quality pie. 4 star flavor.Ambiance -- this place is a greasy spoon type of establishment. You sit at a counter which surrounds a viewable cooking area on three sides. Great type of set-up for a quick bite but not a place you want to linger. 3 stars.Overall value -- 1 stars.

Since it is a basic menu, we weren't expecting too much. My partner's hickory burger was pretty good but it was tiny and the buger very thin, they also forgot to add the cheese (they didnt forget to charge for it though) The french fries were ok, nothing special and my sandwich, a swiss cheese on rye bread that was completely stale and dried out, and the sandwich was piled high with iceberg lettuce which means no flavor. We had two soda's and split a piece of the apple pie. The pie wasnt bad but the crust was a thin, whole wheat totilla, did not resemble a pie crust at all.

My husband and I went here around 5pm on a Sunday with high hopes. I had heard that The Apple Pan had the best burger in Los Angeles, which is a pretty bold statement! We were able to find parking in the small parking lot behind the restaurant, so we were pretty excited. We found 2 seats, and a very grumpy looking older gentleman threw 2 menus in front of us without a word.I only had $25 in cash, but I assumed that would be enough for a couple of burgers and fries at a diner. The decor didn't lead me to believe otherwise, but I was in for a shock when we looked at the menu! The prices seemed a bit high for a greasy spoon. Undeterred, I ran over to Wells Fargo next door to get more money.We each ordered a Hickory Burger and fries. The waiter forgot my husband's french fries, and barely muttered two words to us during our entire meal. My husband was almost done with his burger by the time he got his fries, and then was not offered any ketchup (or an apology). As far as I can tell, they usually ask you if you want ketchup and pour it for you. I asked for a plate (I was, of course, met with silence and a disdainful look), and my husband went to put ketchup on the plate. The waiter glared at him and grabbed the bottle from him (!!) without a word. When my husband told him that he needed ketchup, he reluctantly poured it on the plate for him.The whole meal was uncomfortable. The waiter was miserable to deal with. Sadly for us, the other waiter on duty seemed lovely- smiling, chatting with customers, bringing extra plates and napkins. The food was good, but it wasn't any better than In-and-Out or Five Guys. If we had been lucky enough to get a waiter that was even cordial, I may have enjoyed the meal.

The old mechanical cash register that doesn't need electricity gave the place the old vintage class.The menu is very limited at best with only two types of burgers. I skipped the Hickory burger and ordered the steak burger instead. Sounds fancy, but it's just a beef patty burger. I did ordered their two dollar fries. They don't have a combo or very extensive menu. This one page sheet menu pretty much stayed the same forever.Here's the punch in the gut. That steak burger which sounds fancy, but looked like a famous star from Carl's Junior minus the tomato and such ......cost $8.Yes, I have complained about the gourmet burger coming from a bar that cost $11 in Santa Monica, $12 French toast in West Hollywood, and an $8 omelet in Long Beach. Let's put it this way, if that $8 burger was a wowser, I would not be complaining and comparing it to Carl's.Alas, it's a decent chow, but not really that good. I'm sticking with In-N-Out Burgers as the better burger in town.I think I was also held in a stick up when I ordered their \"Combination\". No, that is a combo meal, but just a simple baked ham and Swiss cheese sandwich with a lettuce. Guess how much that was?.......$7.Yes, I can see this place is more geared towards the affluent crowds of people living nearby or people wants to relieve the Golden Age of Eisenhower and Nixon. But geesh, the prices were harsh.The place can be crowded with people waiting for a seat. It seats less than 32 people, so you are going to need to be there during non-rush hour. Big groups are discourage from coming here. If you think Daikokuya is bad, you haven't seen this place on a prime lunch or dinner hours.I'm just too scared to try the pies because I didn't want my wallet to be drained that quick, but apparently some people have no problem stimulating the economy by buying a piece of any of the five different slice of \u00a0pie that would have cost the same for a whole pie elsewhere.Like I said, it was really hard for me to understand about this place.

Step inside - and it doesn't look like it's been redecorated since 1947. In fact, the waiter who served us honestly looked like he's been there since the beginning. But that's impossible, right? Anyhow, I think the menu truly hasn't changed, and Diet Coke is probably the most recent addition to their menu (see photo). It's all counter - one big U-shaped one - and no tables. You just have to wait next to the wall hoping you get called in order since there are no numbers to pull. We lucked into two seats near the restroom - just in case anything disagreed with us. I ordered the $6.75 Steakburger served with a mix of mayo and their own relish, pickles and a truckload of iceberg lettuce. Jamie went for the same-price Hickory Burger served with their special barbecue sauce. Wrapped in white butcher paper, they stand the burgers up on the counter on their hind buns for no reason except they don't offer plates (see photos). Pretty good and satisfying as a snack near midnight on a Saturday. Long-timers will probably be disheartened to find out that the prices jumped up from $5 within the past couple of years. We shared a $2.25 plate of piping hot French Fries, and the waiter squeezes the ketchup on a paper plate for you (see photo). Totally hit the spot. Diet Cokes are not served in cans but over ice in vintage paper cups in tin paper cupholders (see photo). Of course, we couldn't leave without sharing a $5.50 slice of their homemade pie. They were out of apple at that hour, so we dove into the Boysenberry covered with jagged scoops of Vanilla Ice Cream (see photo). Deliciously decadent snack. Honestly, that's it in terms of the experience. No one was waiting for the seat by the time we finished, so we didn't feel rushed by the waitstaff to move our arses.

The Apple Pan prides itself in using top notch ingredients. For example, they use only a small percentage of an iceberg lettuce (the middle part) in thier hamburgers and all their burgers are made to order. This same buildling has been profitable since they opened in the 20s and even to this day, the family owned business has refused to sell!

I spent countless days at that Apple Pan counter. Literally. I threw up for the first time in public at age 5 here, I lost a tooth here once. I went here for my first meal after I got my braces off. I went on my first boy/girl alone date here. I've been here with friends, ex's, family, strangers, Motley Crue, you name it. \u00a0And through all that nothing has changed... not one bit since 1947. The wallpaper, stools, bathrooms, counter, EVERYTHING is the same. Furthermore, the food hasn't changed either thank GOD. It's still the best damn hickory burger you'll ever sink your teeth into, served with a coke in a little funnel cup and piping hot fries on a paper plate accompanied by the Mt. Vesuvius of ketchup.I can understand how this kind of nostalgia would be lost on someone without this kind of history with The Apple Pan, but it is by far and away the furthest thing you'll find as a \"tourist trap\" in L.A..

When we first walked in, we were greeted with a huge whiff of freshly grilled hamburger patties. It was a cute, little diner with very limited seating. Luckily only two people were there before us. There was no sign up sheet or anything. People just waited out of respect and courtesy. Although there were two ladies that tried to jack the seats before it was their turn. They were super rude and made it seem like they were there before us by standing really close to us and at one point, pushed my friend without saying sorry after!!

The fries came out immediately but unfortunately, they were not that great, and slightly burnt. The server asked if we wanted ketchup and dumped a third of the bottle onto a plate for us. I'm sorry but that was just wasteful!! Our hamburgers quickly came after. I was so excited to take the first bite of my Steak Burger...I was definitely in for a surprise, but not a good one. Their \"special\" sauce overpowered the whole burger and the only thing I tasted was that disgustingness. The only good thing about that burger was the fresh lettuce.

BF was hella starving and he hadn't been to Apple Pan in a long time (I, never) so we trekked out there (like 5 min, haha). I forgot everything I read in the yelp reviews, which may have given me a more objective pov.We walk in around 8 30pm and see that all the seats at the rectangular counter are occupied. three groups of people were in front of us, but busy on the phone. Two seats clear up and we ask the people in front of us if they want to sit, but they tell us to go ahead (really!?..alright if you insist).A old man (between 60-90 years old...big range, i know, but it's hard to tell after a certain age) with an incredible dry sense of humor hands us the menu. We were thinking he's probably the owner or someone the owner thought to hire to give it that old skool feel. I order the steak burger and my BF orders the Hickory burger. We get an order of fries with diet coke, root beer to go along with it.The old man brings us our drinks. They come in paper cone cups, nestled in a metallic holder. I was like whoa.

Our order of fries are slammed in front of us. The mountain of buttery french fries were just yelping to be devoured. I reach for a bottle of ketchup to pound out the sauce but the old man comes back, suavely takes a bottle of ketchup and pours it out onto a ketchup paper plate, mumbling a joke about how slow I am. Haha. this guys is freaking hilarious. Reminds me of \"grumpy old men\" even though i never saw that movie. Our burgers come. we take our pictures as we always do before devouring our meals and i check out my steakburger (i ordered it without the cheese). Two buttery buns bookending half a head of iceberg lettuce, a juicy patty with some sort of relish ketchup combo sauce. I take a bite. WHoa. It's like the first time I had an In-N-Out burger when I was only used to eating big mac's. My burger was like a greasier /juicier version of an In-N-Out burger with cuter and more buttery buns. the relish sauce gave it a nice kick. I had a bite of my BF's Hickory burger. I'd have to say it really kicked my steak burger's a$$. Next time I'm totally getting that. The fries were 90% gone when we left. It was buttery and crispy and soft and big. Nice. While eating, I thought I'd regret it afterwards because the complete meal was this buttery piece of heaven but surprisingly, I didn't feel like crap afterwards like I usually do when I eat something hella greasy like pink's hot dogs or porto's potato balls.The size of the burgers were also appropriate. Not too gargantuan. It was the perfect pre-america-gone-supersized portion.We tipped the old man generously for providing us with light amusement throughout dinner.

Still busy although not too much where I couldn't get seated right away. It's all 50's style diner counter. No tables. All old-school right down to the cash register. Which means like the Pantry downtown, it's all cash-only. Forget plastic.After sitting around for about five minutes, this crusty, old waiter came to me with a facial look of 'what'dya want'? Well, considering I didn't yet receive a menu, it's kind of hard to order. Yea, don't waste too much time here and indeed after I received my menu, I got my order and was out in about 15 minutes. This would be telling later.I went with the staples. Burger, Fries. Didn't order a drink because all the sodas are out of a can. Pass. Stuck with H20. Got my fries first and it's a pretty big order of fries. Somewhat thick and definitely hot out of the fryer, it was exactly what I was looking for that night. They tasted like they were frozen, not fresh-cut but at least they were hot! Waiter then proceed to take out a second plate and started to pour ketchup on it. Guess they figure you want to dip them but I didn't. I kindly told him to stop and he took the plate away.Burger came a couple of minutes later. It's a lot like In'N'Out. Fresh made, a bit thicker than an In'N'Out or Habit burger and pretty tasty. Bun was standard issue. No seeds and fluffy. Decided to pass on the pie since it was a bit on the pricey side and it was late. Overall, good experience.Until about a few hours later.Yep. Food poisoning.

My main qualms with most apple pies are tasteless/thick crusts and over-sweetened apple filling, and this was not a problem here.

Ordered the iced tea, and NEVER had to ask for a refill. Was always full and ready for me to drink by the time I looked over.2. As we were eating, the waiter would come by and pick up our used napkins, and hand us clean ones (even though there were napkin dispensers right next to us). 3. After dessert, the waiter gave me a to-go box for my sandwich, unprompted. And after I packed it in, he even put it in a paper bag for me.4. TIP: This place is cash only.

Holy pie. Yes, that slice of banana cream pie is going to make you become a faithful follower of The Apple Pan. Generous slices of bananas intertwined with sweet custard and eventually topped with light and fluffy whipped cream--this pie so incredibly unforgettable. I was on a date with this handsome artsy character when I first had the pie, and needless to say I was definitely more attracted to the dessert, completely ignoring his witty banters. Oh, that pie. That sweet delicious pie captured my heart. I love it because of its honest appearance of an old-fashioned banana cream pie. I love it because of their use of sliced bananas instead of miniature chunks of banana mixed in a custard overload at other pie joints. I love it because it makes me giggle every time I see it being handed over on a vintage plate. And as I am writing this review strictly about the banana cream pie, sighs of contentment can be heard.

The Apple Pan is what people should think of when they think of a classic burger and not the average tossed-through-a-drive-thru burger you find more than often. This fast food nation has done a lot to kill the classic sit down diner. Thankfully places like the apple pan help in keeping that tradition alive. \u00a0Forget the idea that the workers are cranky.

I usually toss in a 30% tip because of the quality of service here. The place can get busy. When it does you'll have to wait at the door for the next bench to get cleared up.

The idea of pie with a burger may have been phased out of anyone else's mind after the 50's but it's a good mix.

Certain items on the menu seem better than others so if you come, come informed. Food: The apple pan serves burgers, sandwiches, fries, and pies. I think the best item on the menu is the hickory burger which features a juicy, freshly cooked ground beef patty and a bbq flavored sauce that resembles ketchup. The steak burger supposedly tastes like a standard burger while the ham sandwiches are nothing to get giddy over either. I personally liked the fries. They're prepared the way fries should be: crispy on the outside with minimal oil and fluffy on the inside. As for the pies, I think they're overrated for the most part, although the cream they use tastes incredibly fresh. Service: Everything is very personal; the older fellows take your order fairly casually and ring you up using an ancient cash register. The service definitely ranks higher than that at most diners. Extra points for serving food on small plates that are either washed and reused or made from recyclable materials. Atmosphere: Seating is limited and there are no convenient places to wait either in or out of the diner. Personally, I felt weird eating while other people watched me, salivating from the sidelines.

The sauce on top has a sweet relish kick which at first bite I did not love, but by my second or third I was ready to like.One order of fries is more than large enough for two people to suffice, so ignore the urges of your inner hungry hippo and settle on just the one. My fries were soggy though, which is a big no-no for me. I need them crisp, it's half the fun. My compadre had some that fit the bill quite nice as did my neighbor to the other side. It appears I just missed the boat on that front.The apple pie was good and the ice cream a delight. I would have preferred a little more ooey gooey, but it was warm and sweet. My stomach was still more than willing to make some extra room to accommodate this over-indulgent final course.We did have to stand against the wall for quite some time before two stools opened for us to climb atop. The wait is a bit more difficult to endure then your average haunt, as food prep is just a few feet to the side and your nostrils are flooded with the burger aroma the entire time. If you are already hungry the scent and wait can drive you mad.Overall I would say this place is not a knock out, but its fun and a quick bite.

He returned a few minutes later with our fries; the way he plopped them down in front of us reminded me of the way most people half-heartedly drop a bowl of kibble in front of their dogs. The fries were good, but they were hard to enjoy when our server did everything possible to make us feel unwelcome. The service was pretty fast, but I suspect it was just to get us out the door faster.On top of everything, the burgers were a huge disappointment. At the end of the day, there is absolutely no way to justify selling a (previously frozen) quarter-pound cheeseburger (half of which is iceberg lettuce) for $7.50, especially when fries come at an extra premium. I know this is Los Angeles, but the value is simply not there.When the check came, I had to triple-check the guy's math against the menu: 3 mediocre 1/4 pound burgers, 3 small plates of french fries and 3 12-ounce sodas for nearly $40! It was an appropriate way to cap off a bad experience.This place might be \"an institution,\" but there are tons of historic restaurants in LA that don't have to excuse awful customer service and severely overrated food as part of their legacy. The fries and promptness of service (malice notwithstanding) earn The Apple Pan an extra star for a total of 2/5.This is the first time I've felt let down by Yelp.", "Date": "2012-06-09", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "K O.", "ReviewID": "v8i0w49HwYpvjTv1FfuyqQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Old fashioned counter diner.

This place is tiny, and definitely atypical from an average restaurant. What you see is literally the counter and bar stools surrounding the kitchen. You see people sitting side-by-side enjoying their burgers, the workers hustling and bustling in the kitchen, and the server chatting up with the patrons. And you hear chopping, lots of chopping of head after head of lettuce. Me and my companion both bore identical expressions of confusion for a moment, but we quickly adapted to the scene and hopped onto empty barstools, ready to order.After the server, an older gentleman finished joking with the patrons to our adjacent, he looked to us and asked us what we wanted to order. Both of us decided on hickory burgers, fries and cokes. While me and my companion were chatting, the server interjected in between our conversation. I was a little surprised by that since it was a bit unexpected. It's probably just me, but most of the time I tend to prefer the intimacy of having my own table to chat when I am dining.When the food was ready, it was served to us on paper plates... with paper napkins, and plastic utensils. I'm okay with that. However, I did not like how my drink was served to me. Apple Pan provides soda in a can. Although I prefer the taste of soda coming from the fountain freshly carbonated, it doesn't bother me to drink from a can. I was bothered by the cups they provided. You are supposed to drink your soda from a paper cone inside a metal cone-holder. Maybe I'm a soda-snob, but drinking a can of soda in a dixie-cup textured cup, served with no ice is kind of repulsive. What was even more annoying is that I constantly had to refill my pseudo-cup. After a few tries, I gave up and simply drank straight from the can.As for the burgers themselves... they were quite tasty. The meat was soft, tender, and juicy. What makes this burger particularly memorable is that Apple Pan has mastered the art of preparing the burger with absolute perfect lettuce-to-burger ratio. The lettuce is so thick, fresh, crisp, and has the perfect crunch upon chewing. This is enough for me to fall in love with their burgers and to crave it from time to time. Even though the hickory burger is delicious, I admit it is not nearly close to being \"best\" or within the range of being the best burger ever. Honestly, as much as I do like the burgers, the hickory burger was missing a special, vital \"something\" in the flavor.Overall, I greatly enjoy their burgers.

I suppose it would appear the people around me got fries that were crunchy and crisp, but mine were disappointingly soggy on both visits.I've never had their pie before, but that might also be because I've never really had a big spot for pie and at the time, I never had pie. \u00a0But at $6 a piece, it does put a moment of hesitation for me (especially since I was still a UCLA student at the time). \u00a0I'm going to assume that it's pretty good, but it wouldn't be the first time the namesake of a restaurant was ironically piss poor.Overall, I would say come for the experience of sitting where the hamburger cooks are in the middle and enjoy the atmosphere, but beyond that? I would have to say that there are tons of burger places that are more preferable to this joint. In fact, I'd rather go to In-n-Out.

I'd recommend the Hickory Burger over the Steak one just because I liked the taste a lot better. However, both were superb. Make sure to your burger with cheese.

The soft drinks are also served in a unique cup--I'd recommend getting the creme soda or something.I knock off one star because since it's The Apple Pan, and many people recommended it, I ordered and was disappointed by the slice of Apple Pie that was served to us. It was pretty soggy and falling apart. It was a little warm, but not uniformly warm throughout the slice. I think that they just warmed it up in a non-rotating microwave so it wasn't warm all around. Even if it was all warm, however, it wasn't like the best tasting apple pie around. Perhaps if I got it with ice cream it would have been more worth it?At any rate, I wouldn't mind coming back here. The prices are decent, service is quick (if you can find a place to sit), and the food is tasty (except the Apple Pie).Lastly, parking sort of confused us.

Impressions be gone, I was hungry and just wanted to rub my face on much talked about burgers. So we arrive and there's a massive line. Saturday, dinner time, everybody's doing the same thing. We're nothing special. Damn it. Neither of us were sure how to manage a seat around the U-shaped counter so we stood around trying not to piss anybody off. There were no hosts/hostesses or reservations, just guts, and crafty positioning around people who were nearing empty burger wrappers (though at the time we did not account for the timeless...charm of pie). After about fifteen minutes (with people grabbing up seats, our stomachs growling all over the place), neither of us knew what to do so we left. Instead we ate at In-N-Out. We really failed at life that night.However, I recently went back. Bit my lip, buckled down, and yelled at my heart to shut the hell up and walked in. Luckily, we went during that magical limbo between 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Empty seats beckoned to us like sirens. The smell of cooking meat and buckets of apple relish hit us hard. It also helped that I was going with somebody who had been there before and easily steered my doe-eyed naivete in the direction of a seat.Definitely count on splitting up if you're in a large group (whatever it takes!). Our party of four split into two.The menu was simple, straight forward, and sounded delicious. I ordered the Steak Burger and it was great. The fries were delicious (not the best) but I seldom complain about fries. They just need to be hot and within my reach and they can do no wrong. Best of all, they serve Dr. Pepper. No polite smiles that say no \"we're too lame to serve awesomeness\", no surrogates, just the real deal! In odd yet quirky little paper cones. Yay!I had to say no to the pie because it was getting close to that dinner rush line. I felt the eyes burn into my spleen and heard the saliva drop. Mark my words pie, I haven't even started but I'm not done with you!I must say that old man sass cannot be beat. Just ask the two jerks who came in and insisted on ranch and thousand island dressing. The gruff dude at the counter mixed up some apple relish, ketchup, the old mayo, and shrugged. It's hot, it's busy, what else can you do but be a smart ass? The price is reasonable for the quality. For about 10 bucks you can probably get double this spread at another joint but I'd say that my recent experience (and now emboldened self-confidence) warrants repeat trips and the extra couple of dollars.

The burger was very simple; a burger patty, lettuce, pickles, sauce, and cheddar cheese. It was very good and I especially liked the smoky flavor of the patty.

It was good but not as good as the Hickoryburger. It tasted like a pretty standard burger without the smokiness of the Hickoryburger, and the sauce they used had some relish in it which was kind of weird.The lady next to me was raving about how great the apple pie was, and when she ordered it she was talking to the server and they gave her the pie for free. She then turned to me with a giddy look of a child and exclaimed, \"The apple pie is FREE today! You should get one!\" I was skeptical of the pie being free to everyone but shared one with a friend, and it really was free that day!

Never have I gone and not been satisfied, after all of these years it is still one of the best places to go for a burger and slice of pie.These fries are some of my favorites in the area. Twice fried for that nice crunch on the outside and nice fluffy center. They are brought to you as soon as you order them so they are nice and hot. These fries are still delicious even without any salt pepper or ketchup on them. A lot of places make their fries as if they're an after thought, the Apple Pan takes pride in serving you quality fries that are never to greasy or over cooked.The Apple Pan's infamous Hickory Burger is by far the best item on the menu and it is no wonder why the Apple Pan is so famous for this burger. The burger itself is very flavorful and you can taste it even though the rich smokey hickory sauce on the burger. Also topped with a thick layer of crisp lettuce, nice and tangy dill pickles and some sweet onion on a soft hamburger bun. The bun is great because it soaks up the juice of the burger and doesn't fill your mouth with that unpleasant floury taste when you have a bad meat to bread ratio. The hickory burger is among the best classic burgers i have ever had obviously excluding all \u00a0the reinvented gourmet burgers at gastropubs and such.The best pie here is without a doubt the banana cream pie.

It was unbelievable--as we took to the westward facing row of seats we were made real friendly (not really). We placed our orders in tiny subsets on the server's recommendation for burgers, drinks and fries. Burger Breakdown:A quick order yielded quick service--the burgers and accompaniments arrived in relatively no time. \u00a0My burger came on a standard bun wrapped tightly in paper to serve as the catchall, a generous patty, some relish, pickles, tomato, and large bed of iceberg lettuce with some sauce. Simple and satisfying--the relish added a little sweet to the burger that makes it a standout among the current burger joint trends.  On the side: I can see myself going back to show someone the spot but there are a few things I do not care for which are as consistent as the burgers they have been serving. The service is polite in that-old-fashioned-dad-used-be-a-marine-kind of way not too warm and fuzzy. Also, I find it difficult to enjoy my burger when you have customers piling up around you taking bets on when you will finish your meal so they can quickly take your spot.Aside from the jockeying for position and the curt service the burger was delicious and the restaurant god's smiled upon us, as our entire party was able to sit next to each other. The burger is very good and definitely old-fashioned. In total we finished our Apple Pan experience in less than 45 minutes.

Overall, Apple pan is not bad and the authentic 50's diner experience is truly unique. if you're dining here, you're definitely paying for the 50's diner experience and not so much the food. If you're new to LA and new to the LA burger scene, this might be a place to check out. Food: Hickory and Steak burger. Both are really good like most people say, but neither are great. For a burger that uses basic ingredients and is similar in size to an in-n-out double-double, the price close to 6 dollars is unfair. The beef patty is seasoned well but the flavor is lost in all the lettuce that's stacked in the burger.Their fries are tasty but I was pretty sure they were frozen/store-bought french fries. Atmosphere - Good and bad. Good because the 50's diner atmosphere is truly unique and authentic. It's not easy to find 50's style diners that deliver an authentic ambiance like you would find at Apple Pan. While there, you're seated at a horseshoe type counter where the waiters walk up to you and bring your orders right in front of where you're sitting. Bad because the seating is not the easiest to find and good luck getting more than 4 people sitting in one area. And god help you if you cut someone who's waiting or ask for something else (like tomato) on your burger. Overall:Apple Pan is not bad and the atmosphere is what you pay for when dining here. Don't forget to bring cash because its cash only. For basic burgers, Apple Pan's items are one of a kind.However, the makings of a great basic burger are price and taste. They should be good in quality and you shouldn't feel like you were overcharged for the burger itself. Gourmet burgers are excused from this rule, because they often use a variety of non-traditional burger fixings that actually do cost more. Apple pan delivers on taste but falls flat on price.update:tonight was my third time dining and second time sit in.

I eat this burger, every time in silence, without stopping. There's no talking allowed when eating this burger. SIMPLE PLEASURE, without the fancy arugula, fried onions, fancy ketchup, whatever. If you want a good, hearty, simple burger, this is it. Pair it with the fries, and you're set.If you're really trying to stretch your wait, get a slice of the banana creme pie.

She often times nostalgically remembers when the famous Hickory burger cost a hefty $1.65. Times have definitely changed, and although the burger is a bit more money, the flavors are still the same. If you don't believe me, simply ask my Grandma. If you are not afraid of a lot of sauce go for the Hickory burger. Tons of smoky flavor, without the current annoying frills like truffles, and Stilton cheese (not that I am saying those toppings are bad in the least). The burger is always juicy, and more than filling. The fries are always pipping hot, and the sodas are served in old fashioned cone cups. This place is most definitely a blast from the past. The cash registers are over 83 years old, and the servers have this curmudgeonly charm. I have been told that Johnny Rockets got their original idea from The Apple Pan. As for dessert, believe it or not I am not a huge apple pie fan, however the Boysenberry pie is to DIE FOR! If you are eating at Apple Pan, then calories don't exist, so go for the pie al-a-mode.

Since I'm going away for a while I figured I would try out the pie, so I got a slice of pecan with ice cream. This was probably the best pecan pie I've ever had, the flavors were so well balanced and the texture was great. This ice cream was also rich and flavorful, total win.The service was also rock solid. Our server was quick, attentive and very willing to engage us if we asked him questions or advice about the products.

He was very patient and gave us recommendations.Unfortunately, I haven't been back since I stopped eating meat. I really wish they had vegetarian options!

Those paper/metal cup holder thingies they serve their pop (soda) in are pretty cool, though.Oh, and the pies are decent, though by the time I'm finished with the anticlimactic burger and fries I'm not feeling like burning any more holes in my wallet, so I usually pass.

I knew that it wasn't going to be a cheap burger like from In-N-Out, nor was I expecting a Kobe Beef Burger from Umami. I was mostly expecting the restaurant version of Carl's Jr.'s \"Six-Dollar Burger.\" And I wasn't half wrong.The burgers: steakhouse/Hickory. Are plain and simple. Bun, meat, cheddar cheese (optional), lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes. The Hickory sauce on the Hickory, and the traditional mayo/ketchup combo on the steakhouse. Overall... pretty damn lame. The Hickory sauce made up for the lack of creativity/uniqueness to the burgers.The fries were also your typical restaurant quality fries. Again, nothing special. ('Cept for the price: $2.25) Good, but not anything to rave about. Although my friend did get his fries well done, and boy were they crsipy, and surprisingly delicious. I may have to try that next time.The biggest disappointment of all? The apple pie. Me, and my silly sunny disposition thought: \"Oh well, it's called the Apple Pan, that must mean they're famous for their pies!\" So yeah... the pie is $5.50 a slice. With an extra $2 for whipped cream or ice cream. A rip-off.I thought, \"Hell, the pie should be good on it's own. No ice cream please.\" And was that a mistake. The pie was runny and kinda lacking anything special to it. In fact it wasn't any better than the store bought kind, heated and put on a plate. The crust had a slight cinnamon taste to it, which you would think would add to the dish, but no detracts, and just becomes another addition to the trainwreck that the pie is.

Not a lot of seating but you get served quickly so a seat is bound to open up real fast. ENTREES: Small menu has two types of burgers. We had the hickory burger. The meat was flavorful, but nothing to write home about. Fries were average, again nothing to write home about. DESSERT: We split an apple pie with vanilla ice cream, it was good. But, it could have been better. When we visited there were a few customers that came in just to buy a couple of whole pies to go. WHERE I STAND: It's okay. I would stop by again if I'm in the area. I wouldn't drive out of my way to revisit though. Unique atmosphere and unique clientele. What I do like about the place is that they have disposable plates, cups and utensils. As if their mantra was \"We refuse to wash a dish.\" With clientele only staying on an average of 15 to 20 minutes washing dishes would require time. :) Smart.", "Date": "2012-06-09", "Author_Location": "Canoga Park, CA"}, {"Author": "Jordan C.", "ReviewID": "7hAueLlvb1_WUY5NfQMwZg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Seating is not exactly normal.

That being said, this place is a legend. You come because you hear about it. This place is hyped.I understand why.This is one of the first cafes in Los Angeles. The dimmed lighting, unique seating, and the 60's vibe added to the unique atmosphere. From my experience there's no place like it.They pride themselves in perfecting simplicity. They have every right to. All ingredients added to the burgers, fries and pies made them excellent. Therefore, their food is in fact perfectly simple.There's a problem. It's good quality simple food. It's as if I went to a grocery store and bought an ordinary fuji apple for twenty cents. Then I went to Whole Foods, bought an organic fuji apple grown from a famous apple farm for a dollar. Of course the organic fuji apple tastes better, but is it so different that it's worth the extra eighty cents? If I didn't know that the Whole Foods apple had such a fantastic reputation and a hefty price tag, would I care that much about it? Just because it's expensive and famous, it's still a simple apple. So no.Same with this place. Although it mastered the simple hamburger, it is still only a simple hamburger. They reached the extent of excellence in a simple burger, but it only tastes like a better quality In-N-Out burger. I didn't think the burger was worth the extra $5, considering that there was nothing incredibly special or unique about their burgers.However, their pies were completely affordable/worth it. Come here for pies. Buy a whole one and take it home. In a busy town like Los Angeles, you cannot find high quality pies like theirs. In this sense, the pie is worth every penny they charge.

The short version is that the burgers are above average, the fries are okay, the dessert was excellent, and it was all a bit overpriced.As for the long version, my friend and I split a steak burger, a hickory burger, and some fries. We both ordered pecan pies for dessert. The steak burger was my favorite of the two burgers -- loved the sauce. The hickory burger I didn't like as much because the sauce was too sweet; I prefer BBQ sauce with more zest and spice. Both burgers were good. As some reviewers pointed out, the lettuce is too thick. You can just remove some slices or eat them separately and pretend you ordered a healthy salad. The beef tasted good and was thicker than I was expecting based on the reviews. Some people said they were In-n-Out sized. I disagree. They're not large by any means, but they're bigger than that.The fries were okay. Nothing memorable. If I come back here again, I would order two burgers instead of a burger and fries.The pecan pie was outstanding -- easily one of the best I've had all year. The dessert was actually my favorite part of the meal, which speaks nicely of the pie and not so great on the actual burgers.As for the price, it's too high for what it is. With double cheese, the burgers were over $8. Dessert was also $8. I forgot how much the fries cost, but I'm trying to forget about those fries in general. The burgers are good and the dessert was great, but it was too much for what it was.I'm not saying I wouldn't eat here again. I enjoyed my meal, even though it was overpriced.

The menu is incredibly simple - a couple of burgers, fries, pie, and drinks. If you're looking for a kick-ass meal on a Friday night, try the Hickory Burger with Fries, a creme soda, and a slice of their mind-altering Banana Creme Pie. Apple Pan's no-frills atmosphere will grab you as soon as you walk through the small wooden doors facing Pico (near Westwood Boulevard). There are no tables at Apple Pan -- just one long continuous bar that wraps around the master bedroom sized dining room. One of two bartenders will take your order and the team behind them goes to work building your burger as carefully and slow as construction on the 405. The fries and drinks will usually come right out so you'll have something to nosh on while your burger cooks on the open air griddle at the center of the room.Above all, the Banana Creme pie is my very favorite thing to get. It came on recommendation from one of the waiters and I've never looked back to the apple pie since. Layer upon layer of luscious fresh banana slices mixes perfectly with a mound of banana creme under a whipped topping. Mix all that with a to-die-for buttery crust...and...well...the only way to understand it is to go there and try it. Please, go there and try it.Some words of advice: The Hickory Burger is best eaten hot, so make sure you eat-in at Apple Pan (I took Apple Pan to the Pacific drive-in once, but this food is best fresh). What makes Apple Pan most special is the crowd of regular Angelenos that fill the bar stools everyday.

The steakburger is one of L.A.'s classics. I love the Tillamook cheddar cheese. I love the relish. It has too much lettuce though. I asked for less once, but was given an indignant look by one of the servers who I think was there the first time I ate there. As said, I only did that once. And I'm not at all bashful. I think I just felt like I perpetrated a crime, without feeling guilty about it.I had a sandwich once instead of a burger, cos they looked so good when i saw them. It was really good. I can't remember which one it was. I love getting a Dr. Pepper there and drinking it in the paper cone they give you, full of ice. I love the glass bottles of Heinz ketchup. They're named for pie. The apple pie is pretty good, but there is a huge dome of air because they don't use pie birds. Not sure what to think about that. The Dreyer's ice cream that they have to get with the pie is the best vanilla ice cream I've ever had. Where the hell do they get it? It's like triple super duper french vanilla.

When dining at Apple Pan you definitely feel warm and cozy sitting next to strangers and right in front of your servers.While the atmosphere is great, the food could be better. The burgers are nothing special. If you order a burger, I would recommend the Hickory Burger or the Steak Burger. Each comes with lots of lettuce, relish, and a fresh patty. Cheese costs a little extra, which is strange to me. Anyways, I would prefer In N Out burgers over any of the ones made here because they are both cheaper and tastier. \u00a0On the other hand, the pies are delicious and come in large portions. The banana cream pie is bomb! It's got a tasty cream with a little bit of custard on top and a hefty amount of bananas. For all people who love bananas, I highly recommend this at Apple Pan. The only downside to the large slice of banana goodness is the price ($7-8). The other pies are just average. I found the apple pie and the pecan pie to be a little dry and not very warm. But overall, the pies are the true stars at Apple Pan, not the burgers.For the eaters willing to wait a little bit for a seat at the counter and to spend money on dessert, Apple Pan is great.

The Apple Pie and Boysenberry Cream pie were great. \u00a0Very friendly wait staff offered to cut mine and my friends in half so we could share. \u00a0It's no wonder this place has been around using the same recipe's for the last century... it works. \u00a0I've had better burgers and pie, sure but the atmosphere and little diner touches make this place a must visit for burger fans. \u00a0I'll definitely go back but this time I'll try the Hickory Burger or get my Steakburger without the sauce.", "Date": "2010-05-31", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Impossible Girl Q.", "ReviewID": "4MU0mJp6trE4F131039XjQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright, I truly think you have to be a native to understand this place or, have really good taste and standards for a burger. The Hickory burger is unique in taste and succulence. This is a big burger with a good heap of lettuce and a bunch of fresh onions. This is a burger that you dig into and you come out sloppy. The fries are pretty decent and they serve your beverage in an old fashioned way, I recommend the cream soda. The service is excellent seeing as this is a hole in the wall joint, but hey, that makes it all the more charming.They've also got amazing coffee. I have no idea what brand they use, and I'm not an avid coffee drinker so it's saying something. Also, you can never go wrong with a slice of their pies. The people bitching about prices are exaggerating, I find the prices to be more than fair and well worth it. Would I eat here everyday? Probably not, but I don't crave burgers on a daily basis.

Unfortunately, the deliciousness of its burger doesn't make up for the fact that there is just not enough seating in this place! Maybe that's what adds to the charm and the trendiness? I don't know.What's for sure is that we will never get 10 seats at the same time for the Burger Club (BurgerClubLA.com) to actually try this burger as a group, unless we go at like 3am on a tuesday (Are they even open then?). So instead, I ventured out to Apple Pan to try the burger myself with a buddy. IT WAS DELICIOUS. Easily a 4.5 on our scale in terms of taste. I highly recommend it.Here comes the bad parts: The wait for two seats was over 20 minutes. You get deducted for that. It doesn't matter how old fashioned you want to be, you guys gotta figure out how to control demand. You're leaving money on the table here. Even more importantly, once I was seated, I felt like I was being pressured the whole time to eat my food as quickly as I could and get the heck out of the seat for the next guy. that's just not the vibe I want when scarfing down to beef.Second, the place only takes cash. I know I know, it goes back to the charm and quaintness of the Apple Pan being so old fashioned... (or maybe it's because these guys aren't paying all their taxes and so only want to operate on a cash-basis)... regardless, you've heard me say this before, it's 2010. In about 5 years, i don't expect anyone to be walking around with cash in their pocket. It doesn't make sense. Yes, there is an ATM right across the street, but that's even worse. Paying a $2 surcharge to get money out to pay for an $8 burger is ridiculous. Get with the program people.So... my 4.5 drops to a 4 because of these issues. sorry Apple Pan, there are others around town that can provide a similarly delicious burger with much much less hassle.", "Date": "2010-10-18", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Josh B.", "ReviewID": "Ob0kyRfOHzkKxF-kH8HuQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Of late I have been on a quest to crown the King of all LA burgers.

They say you only get one chance to make a first impressions but I sometimes you just have a bad day. This is what I thought when I first went to the legendary Apple Pan in Santa Monica, California. Maybe they just had a bad day? The small establishment has been around since 1947 and is known as one of the better burger joints in Southern Cali. The first go around I order the Steakburger served with mayonnaise, their own sauce, pickles, lettuce and melted natural Talamook cheese. The bun was nothing special, it was like the bun you would get in a high school cafeteria. The patty was not horrible tasting but not great. Just run of the mill. I really did not enjoy the pickles either. I am just not a fan. I walked out of Apple Pan the first time disappointed. Before I left I asked the chef behind the counter what I should of asked when I walked in, What is the best burger? He replied the Hickoryburger. I thought to myself, good job kid, go to a classic burger joint and order the wrong burger. Oooops.Because of this, I decided I must give Apple Pan a second chance and give this Hickoryburger a run. One thing you need to know, when I order an item for review I do not change anything on it. I believe to deliver a solid review you have to experience the dish the exact way the chef imagined it.I started my meal with a Coke Float. I just love the combination of vanilla ice cream and Coke. I think it is from my childhood. It was a constant growing up. It's funny because I don't like cream soda but I love drinking the Coke after the ice cream melts. Go figure? The Coke float was great but it does not take much to make it work. Coke and ice cream and you are set.Burgers and fries go together like pasta marinara and garlic bread, like Ken and Barbie. They just fit. The Apple Pan fries come out unsalted. I like that because too much salt can be overwhelming. When there is too much salt on fries they taste like salt sticks. The fries were crunchy and served very hot. Right out of the deep frier. I prefer my fries slightly under cooked, with a slight bend in them and mushy potato inside. These were not my favorite but they were good. Now own to the main attraction. The Hickoryburger is served with mayonnaise, thier own sauce, pickles, lettuce, and melted natural Talamook cheese. Reading the ingredients and comparing it back to the Steakburger it is easy to assume these burgers are going to taste pretty much the same.I am what movie goers and novelists reefer to as a hopeless romantic. I don't fall in love with love. I fall in love with food and the nostalgia that surrounds it. And when I see a burger that has been satisfying customers for 50 plus years I start to think the impossible. Like most hopeless romantics my yearning for _food_love fell short. Upon taking my first bite of the Steakburger memories of my first trip to Apple Pan flooded my head. Again, the same run of the mill burger. It might be a problem but I was expecting greatness. Same bun, I knew that, the burger patty was tasty, almost savory but just average. There was way too much lettuce, Imagine the burger standing 3-4 inches tall, 2 inches of that was lettuce. Their own sauce had a mild spice and smokey flavor to it. Nothing special at all. The pickles were no good. I removed the lettuce and pickles for the second half of the burger to see if I could salvage the meal. After removing the lettuce and pickles, the burger took on the visual characteristics of the Parker Medirien burger. Not even close to as good.At the end of the day, their special sauce did not move me. It was better without the pickles but even then it was just average. I have had better burgers at Carl's Jr, flame broiled baby!Knowing this would be my last time at Apple Pan I got a slice of pie. I had to, I mean the place is called Apple Pan, they must do this right? The pie was good, I will admit I am not much a pie guy, but I can still spot good when I taste it. It was served runny, and the apples had a nice cinnamon flavor. The apples were not too mushy either. The crust was a little on the thin side.

Parking- They have a lot in the back (the side facing away from Pico) that can fit about 10 cars. \u00a0It's usually full but always worth a try. \u00a0What I generally do to get parking is park in the Wells Fargo lot right across the street. \u00a0If you're a customer, walk \u00a0up to the ATM and grab a 20 (this will get any daytime parking attendants off your back) or just walk through the branch and exit on the side via Pico. \u00a0The parking attendants will generally never harass you, but these methods will serve if you need them.2. Waiting for a Seat- Depending on what time of day you come in, you will probably have a wait for a seat between 0 and 20 minutes (The longest I've ever waited is 30). I'd say the average wait is about 10 minutes. \u00a0Seating is on the honor system and your time of wait is dependent on how big your party is (since it's a counter style restaurant, it might take a while to get 3+ seats that are together). \u00a0I would suggest negotiating with other customers to figure out your seating arrangement.3. Ordering- While you are waiting for seats to open up, take a look at the menu. \u00a0You can find these around nearly every napkin/ketchup kiosk on the counter or at the registers. \u00a0Figure out what you want to eat and drink because a few of the servers will want you to order quickly, lest you feel the wrath of the server leaving you for another customer. \u00a0The general rule is, the older the server, the more on your A-Game you will need to be when ordering. \u00a0The three most popular options are the Hickoryburger (this is what I usually get), the Steakburger and the Tuna Melt. \u00a04. The Burgers. \u00a0The burgers here are great. \u00a0Expect a good amount of crispy lettuce to be bunned up next to your burger. \u00a0This lettuce adds a great crunch which contrats with the soft bread/meat patty. \u00a0The hickory sauce is the wildcard here. \u00a0It's very tasty and sweet. \u00a0If you also order fries, \u00a0ask for a plate of it along with ketchup. \u00a05. Fries. Get em. They are good. \u00a0If you like you're fries a little crispy, ask for them \"well-done\". \u00a0Also, expect to get your hands a little bit dirty. You may lose some lettuce or some ketchup, so don't be afraid to wipe down every so often with a napkin. \u00a05. Dessert- After your meal, the server will ask you if you will be having anything for desert. \u00a0Take a look at the menu and see what you like. \u00a0Also, don't be afraid to ask questions about what they have in the back that day. You can't go wrong with the Apple Pie a la mode.ALRIGHT, that's it. \u00a0Hope I could run you through the entire experience. \u00a0This is one of the best burgers in the world and also one of my favorite restaurant experiences.", "Date": "2012-06-27", "Author_Location": "Berkeley, CA"}, {"Author": "Eve R.", "ReviewID": "XFeoaoJ0cWknyKobhX0G4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hickory Burger, French fries and a cream soda.

Weekly. I gather my friend and I came in during a sort of patron lull on a weekday late afternoon; there was no line, and there were plenty of seats for the taking. That being said, the first thing I noticed was the gentleman waiting on us; his behavior was so brusqe one would've thought there was a line as long as the next Star Wars movie to get in! Utensils and food were rapidly procured and served in a manner I can only describe as \"very 3D\".; I nearly ducked when the menu came hurling like a sort of meteor, but I suspected it was all part of the \"you are now in a 1950's-style truck stop greasy spoon so why bother with prissiness?\" style. Instead of waitresses names \"Toots\" and \"Ruby\" there was, as mentioned, this robotically efficient waiter who I'm willing to bet has spent more years in the Pan than the apples. He was quite unintentionally like some cartoonish character in a book, so I eventually engaged him in a litle conversation, and found, to my surprise, that he was quite aware some people have found his service style a bit off-putting and noted, with briefly doleful eyes that \"all the compliments we get are about the food and not the servers\".LOL! I thought it better not to suggest that if he didn't act like he was serving mutton in the Thunderdome he might get a few cyber-strokes. He ultimately rather charmed me after all once I got his attention. The food? Oh yes, that... well, what can one say? It was pretty much like going to Grandma's for lunch and made the boy in me smile. I loved my juicy and fresh-tasting hickory burger and the apple pie was to die for, sweet yet tart. The fries were okay, neither fabulous nor a failure; at least they weren't those dreadfully tasteless, frozen crinkle-cut things so many places pass off as edible. My iced tea was odd; it barely tasted of tea, more like just a glass of bland, tea-colored water. The price tag for this adventure in Retro-Land effectively bridged the time warp and was a bit steeper than expected, but I was glad I finally got to see what all the woop-dee-doo is about. It's a cute place for a splendid burger and heavenly slice of pie; I noticed there were few women customers, but most of the men had expressions of trance-like, glazed pleasure while chowing down. (I'm surprised they didn't have a vintage old RCA \u00a0television showing Rin Tin Tin or The Lone Ranger, for this place is pretty much \"boy heaven\"..) I would go back again, but will edit my menu choices next time for the sake of frugality.

When ordering a burger, you get a thin patty with a gangload of fresh lettuce and a pickle and mayo unless you tell them otherwise and a sauce, both of which are pseudo sweet ketchup based sauces, but I can speak to the hickory which is slightly sweeter. \u00a0You get a big size fries which is meant to be split and it comes quickly with a slab of ketchup arriving almost simultaneous to the fries. If you want, you can get an above average diner style cup of coffee with real cream along with your giant-size pie. \u00a0Banana cream would be my recommendation, but I do like the apple pie a la mode, mainly for the crust and the ice cream though.SERVICEThe Service is meant to churn and burn because the wait is generally long, so don't expect any conversation, but don't expect to have to ask for a refill or ketchup cause both are coming. \u00a0Generally speaking, if you do ask for something it will usually arrive even if it appears that your server didn't hear you. \u00a0Now to be honest, I haven't really been frequenting the Pan of late, and our boys may be getting old, but I'm sure it'll still be true. \u00a0I did go recently only to see a new server who had come out from the kitchen so I was totally thrown off and forgot to ask for no mayo. \u00a0I will say that the burger didn't live up to my memory, but was still good. \u00a0I'd like to blame the mayo, but probably can't.GENERALWhenever I bring an out-of-towner to this place, the reaction is generally predictable. \u00a0If the person likes a sit-down restaurant, then you'll lose them as soon as they see the line, the counter-top style service and how cramped the place is. \u00a0They'll most likely end up bitching about the price. If you bring someone who likes \"finds\" or has their favorite place in their local town, that person will appreciate the experience and the experience will be enough for them to enjoy the burger and want to come back regardless of the price, since the price is far from breaking the wallet.PICKING A SIDEThe most important \"tip\" that I can share is buried in the first paragraph. \u00a0There are TWO lines in the restaurant. \u00a0As soon as you walk in, you either go left or right, assess the people around you and you'll be ahead of anyone who walks in after you and heads to your side. If you went left and someone after you went right, and a space opens up on the right, you chose the wrong side (or felt it was worth the wait to go to your \"friendly\" servers side). \u00a0We chose Hector over Gordon because we felt he was faster, not because of his smile, but they're both pretty damn fast.I'm still giving the place a 4 even though the majority of you will end up leaving disappointed.es.", "Date": "2012-03-08", "Author_Location": "Torrance, CA"}, {"Author": "Jennifer C.", "ReviewID": "hSEbUxEU9qwOJckpU3S48Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this place!

Once inside, you'll actually see what you've been smelling since you opened your car door (I don't know how the neighbors can stand the smell of burgers all day long), in the middle of this small 1940's square shape counter you'll find the brick BBQ where all those delicious burgers are cooked. Now, as far as the burgers go you can do no wrong: the hickory and steak burgers are both amazing. \u00a0Not only are they juicy and flavorful, but they're also greasy like they should be. \u00a0And just for good measure, they make a homestyle hickory sauce and relish that is divine. On either burger, you have the option of putting melted cheese on it, and here comes the difference maker: the lettuce. \u00a0Unlike those fast food places where you get a stale lettuce leaf or two on your burger (*cough* cough* InNOut), the burger masters at the Apple Pan make sure to put a fresh and crunchy wedge of lettuce on your burger, as a way of enhancing all those flavors. \u00a0I'm telling you, they got it down to a science!! \u00a0Overall, the burgers are magnificent because they're fresh, the ingredients enhance the flavors, and they're cooked just right with the right amount of spice.To add: the fries are pretty good as well, nice and crispy in a sufficient amount. \u00a0If that wasn't enough, pie o my!! \u00a0Apple pie, banana pie, chocolate cream pie....and many more all home made. \u00a0They're just great, no doubt about it. \u00a0A side note, check out the cups that you're served. \u00a0Whatever you choose to drink (root beer, coke, sprite) they'll serve it in a cone shaped paper cup inside a metal mold.....you can't miss it, its this and the ambiance that takes you back to the LA of old.Oh, and if you've never been there b4, don't be foolish by looking like a tourist in the back of the shack waiting for the waiter to seat you, just go ahead and take an open seat...then they'll take your order. \u00a0You'll thank me.The only negatives I can think of is the parking: sometimes you can get a spot in their lot or in the lot across the street at the Pavilion. \u00a0Don't risk it by parking it in the residential area, you may get it towed away. \u00a0Sometimes, depending on the time of day you hit up the Apple Pan, you may have to wait a few minutes to get a seat. \u00a0Though I was once there on a Saturday night at 7, and I got a seat in less than 5 minutes. \u00a0Finally, be aware that you're paying for a great burger, a french fry, a coke, a different type of service (I call it \"old school and no nonsense\"), and the experience. \u00a0A burger, a fry, and a drink will run you about $10-12. \u00a0Tip if you can, these waiters put up with a lot of crap and they're there for hours, don't be a penny pincher.Overall, a great experience and a great burger an fry, a rare thing to find these days with so many fast food chains.", "Date": "2009-10-05", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Angela C.", "ReviewID": "WH5afAoulhW3gwG9gXvJVA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i got a hickory burger, fries, and an apple pie.this place is so old school that they use old ass registers, take cash only, serve drinks in a paper cone cup w/a holder, and waiters are all over 60 yrs old. \u00a0they're super nice tho! \u00a0burger was verrrry declicious. every single bite i took made a crisp sound. lotta iceberg lettuce, tasty meat, ketchup based special sauce, melted cheese, and soft ass buns. :) \u00a0the only thing i can say is there were no onions nor tomato in it. it cost about $7 for one burger. \u00a0value wise i may have to go with in&out. \u00a0apple pie wasnt that great. i was making love to the chocolate cream pie this boy was eating next to me. \u00a0now that looked fricken good. \u00a0this apple pie had a thinass crustings all around and the pie wasnt even heated up. \u00a0i dont' think i'll go back. but i enjoyed the been-there-ate-that-experience.", "Date": "2010-01-29", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "FOXWOOD F.", "ReviewID": "1OMrdJd9s8a4n2b4UfEaTw", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "so we got sucked in based upon some of the better reviews and the fact that it's like #101 on Jonathan Gold's LA Eats list... we were in downtown LA at the Jewelry District getting our gems on for our 15th anniversary rings and felt like we wanted a genuine burger experience... hopped on the 10W and 15 minutes later we were pulling up, VERY hungry!the down and dirty: \u00a0what we ate - four people, three hickory burgers / one steakburger... indistinguishable in taste... and no onions? really???

The place is rather small and it seems like it's usually pretty packed. You have to wait around for a seat, but the inefficient thing is that they don't take numbers or anything. Therefore if you are waiting on one side of the room and someone gets up on the other side, most likely someone waiting on the other side of the room will get the seat (even if you got there first). As far as the hickory burger goes, it was pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. I'm not a huge fan of cheese (but I got it anyways) and I never get my burgers with mayo (which it comes with). That being said, I think some ingredients that people think are a must for a good burger are missing in what I consider a good burger. Anyhow, I think the other guys thought the burger was pretty good. The fries were fairly crispy, which I liked. At the end of the meal, we decided to top it off with the apple pie a lo mode. The apples were a tad bit too soggy for my personal preference, but the overall dessert was solid. I'd definitely get it again.What is nice about the place is that there's a real old school feel to it. I think the place was created in the 40's or 50's, and you definitely get that feel in there.

One of the guys mentioned the Apple Pan as being this amazing burger place that he loved, but said it was super far away. He told if we were ever in the West LA area, we had to stop by and get a Hickoryburger there. Lo and behold, two days later, we were in LA, visiting the Tim Burton exhibit at the LACMA. Around dinnertime, we decided to try this place. We got lucky and found parking in the rear (there are like 8 spots). Upon entering, we notice that this place was small, with limited seating. That's because the eating area is one giant countertop surrounding the grill station. There are about 20 seats surrounding it. It had an old diner feel to it which was pretty cool. Since we were a party of 5, we had to split up to find seats. My husband and I got a couple of seats in the far right corner, which was nice- more privacy. The waiter behind the counter immediately came and got our drinks orders- cream soda and a water. The soda came in a sno-cone paper cone in a metal container. Interesting. My husband and I both order Hickoryburgers with cheese. Only downside- burgers are not customizable. Only mayo, lettuce, meat, house sauce, and optional cheese. The burger themselves are great- wonderful special sauce on them!!! Delicious burgers :) Fries were great too- perfectly crispy outside and soft on the inside. Our waiter even poured ketchup for us. After our burgers, we decided to try a slice of their apple pie. It was good, but it could have been better. The insides were soupy, the apples were not pieces, but more like apple puree, \u00a0and the crust was not flaky, just kinda bland. We still finished it, but I was not totally loving the pie.

It's like the gloomiest place on the planet... refreshingly gloomy. I'm certainly not complaining. Diners sit around a U-shaped bar, hunched over their burgers and fries. Inside the U, men in white paper hats, who look like their names would be Homer or Elmer, work the grease. If one of them happens to notice you've sat down, he might approach you with an order pad and say, \"Talk to me.\" You can order a burger, another kind of burger, a grilled cheese, an egg salad or a tuna salad (yikes), fries, and a soda. And pie. I can't vouch for the burgers as I don't eat meat, but my friend said they were quite good. When we declined to finish up our meal with a slice of pie (please, I'd eaten a vat of french fries), our server's face crumpled. \"No pie?\" he asked, like a child might ask, \"No Santa Claus?\" Then he gave this look like \"I know you two have enjoyed a slice or two of pie in your time.\" I felt sort of bad.\rNow an interesting thing happens with the clientele here. It seems that the \"local characters\" sit on the right side of the room, and everyone else sits on the left.

Tack on a paper cone full of french fries for $1.75 and another paper cone full of soda for $1.25 and you still come out of there under $10. The burgers are served just how I like them.... with mayo, pickles and lettuce, (no tomatoes). Cheddar and swiss cheeses are available for an extra 40 cents. Get the cheddar. So why only 3 stars, you ask? Well, I'll tell you.... it's the special sauce. I really loathe that special relish sauce.

I can't rate on the burgers (maybe the next time I visit the place), but I can tell you a little bit about their tasty fries and comforting apple pie. All the seating is bar-style seating, all around one large U-shaped counter that surrounds the general cooking area. There's this cool old man that waits on all the tables at the restaurant.Fries are ~$2, they were nice and fresh, crisp, but soft on the inside. The fries come in a good sized mound on a small plate. It's a good portion for the price you pay. Halfway through the fries, the waiter got us a couple cups of water, without our asking. That earned a point for service right there. It wasn't a crazy gesture, but it shows he's an attentive waiter. The waiter then asked if we were ready for our apple pie. We ordered it without any extras on top ($2 for whipped cream or ice cream). A slice went for ~$5.50. In terms of size, it was about 1/4 of a standard tin pie pan. Still, it was a bit pricey for a slice of pie, in my opinion. Luckily though, it tasted very home-y. The crust is buttery and very simple, and compliments the apples very well. The apples were warm and tender. Altogether, it was a comfort to eat. It doesn't even need whipped cream or ice cream because the pie is already sweet from the apples. On top of that, whipped cream/ice cream would just cool down the entire dish, losing the warm comfort-factor of the pie altogether. Steph's Recommendation(s):When you're hankering for a nice late night snack, I'd give their fries and pie a try!", "Date": "2010-10-06", "Author_Location": "San Jose, CA"}, {"Author": "Vincent L.", "ReviewID": "Sz6udEMHc_K6NDgCfYmDww", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had the Hickory Burger and it was alright.

I am not sure where all the hype for this place comes from because it does not deserve it. The food is OK, the service is terrible, rushed, and inconsiderate. Apparently it is a crime to ask if they make a double cheeseburger (which they will not). My waiter said no to all of my questions before I even finished asking them. I joked with my brother that he should have a \"NO\" button on the counter so he could just press it at the customers and save his breath, which he obviously did not like to waste. And good luck coming with more than two people, this place is so small and crammed that we saw families having to split up and sit at opposite ends of the counter (which is all this \"restaurant\" really is, a counter. A counter with SUPER tight seating). It is a struggle to even get in this place, you open the front door and suddenly your standing in the walk-in fridge. Also, if you prefer restaurants that serves food on plates, the Apple Pan probably isn't for you. Burgers are handed to you wrapped In N' Out Style sans box. Fries come on a small paper plate the size of a small bread plate. Pros - The fries are amazing, probably the best I have ever had. They are super clean, hot and crispy....I believe fried to order in very clean oil. The steak burger is OK, but I have had much better \"classic style\" burgers at countless other places. Daglas Drive-In Burgers in Canoga Park kills this place just to name one. And I would choose a Bob's Big Boy Double Deck over an Apple Pan Burger any day of the week. The Apple Pie w/ Ice Cream is by far the best Diner Style Apple Pie A la Mode i have ever had and is rivaled by none - perfection. Cons - I know the little paper cone cup idea is quirky, but it actually makes your beverage difficult to drink! Don't go to Apple Pan thirsty, because all you can do is sip out of this snow cone. Also only can soda at $1.50 a pop. No fountain - BOOOOOOOOOOOO! Cash only!!!

The place actually looked quite nice and very charming as if the outside of the place looked like an old hickory shack. What's even better was that the inside of this place looked very unique as they only have an U-shape counter seats. There are no tables or booth seats for privacy. Just the counter seats like you have seen in the old Alan Ladd film noir days. I guess they do all their cookings at the brick-layers oven grill as it brings out the flavor I guess. The old mechanical cash register that doesn't need electricity gave the place the old vintage class. The menu is very limited at best with only two types of burgers. I skipped the Hickory burger and ordered the steak burger instead. Sounds fancy, but it's just a beef patty burger. I did ordered their two dollar fries. They don't have a combo or very extensive menu. This one page sheet menu pretty much stayed the same forever. Here's the punch in the gut. That steak burger which sounds fancy, but looked like a famous star from Carl's Junior minus the tomato and such ...cost $8. Yes, I have complained about the gourmet burger coming from a bar that cost $11 in Santa Monica, $12 French toast in West Hollywood, and an $8 omelet in Long Beach. Let's put it this way, if that $8 burger was a wowser, I would not be complaining and comparing it to Carl's. Alas, it's a decent chow, but not really that good. I'm sticking with In-N-Out Burgers as the better burger in town. I think I was also held in a stick up when I ordered their Combination. No, that is a combo meal, but just a simple baked ham and Swiss cheese sandwich with a lettuce. Guess how much that was?.......$7. Yes, I can see this place is more geared towards the affluent crowds of people living nearby or people wants to relieve the Golden Age of Eisenhower and Nixon. But geesh, the prices were harsh. The place can be crowded with people waiting for a seat. It seats less than 32 people, so you are going to need to be there during non-rush hour. Big groups are discourage from coming here. If you think Daikokuya is bad, you haven't seen this place on a prime lunch or dinner hours. I'm just too scared to try the pies because I didn't want my wallet to be drained that quick, but apparently some people have no problem stimulating the economy by buying a piece of any of the five different slice of pie that would have cost the same for a whole pie elsewhere.

I had felt pretty bad for doing so since they were incredibly busy, running about the entire area (literally). Despite that, the server who helped me didn't give any attitude at all and handed me a menu, ensuring me that he'll be back to take my order when I'm ready. The professionalism they give off for service is very nice, though it's not the smiling friendly kind. Don't take it personally if none of them smile and greet you warmly! They're just very, very busy people and it's great that they can keep level-headed in that sort of environment. I wasn't there for long, but from what I could understand, you have to seat yourself. Once a diner has finished and leaves a stool empty, you have to rush over and claim it, though all the customers seemed well-behaved. All in all, I'd say their service was good.The Food:My order was a hickory burger, to-go. Again, the server was nice enough to remember that I was a first-timer and asked if I would like to add cheese to it, which I did. Arriving at my friend's house, I found that the burger was still nicely wrapped and intact, though some sauce had leaked out. Presentation wise, it's a very neat and clean burger. As for the flavour of the burger, unfortunately, it's not anything special. The patty tasted like any regular beef patty with the slightest hint of hickory, while the sauce tasted like a mix of mainly barbeque sauce and ketchup. I love vegetables so the amount of lettuce they put inside was just perfect, plus the cheese was nicely melted. The buns were airy and soft, but was mainly... air. One thing that set their burgers apart was the texture of their patty. Indeed, it's taste was nothing special, but the patty was loosely packed, giving it a nice crumbly and moist texture to it that I rather enjoyed.The Decor:If there's anything that'll draw me back to this place, it's the decor. From the inside to outside, everything is unique and fully vintage. This small wooden building houses a small dining area that consists of a large U-shaped counter. Dead center is where they cook all of the burgers, sandwiches, etc. (minus pies, I'm sure). The walls are completely lined with large rectangular wooden windows that clearly show you the outside world and vice versa. There aren't many things hanging around other than furniture, but the doors of the entrance is absolutely adorable, though I don't know why; they just... are. I actually wanted to hang around the door while waiting for my order. For me, being around all of the decor made me feel good and definitely completes the experience. The Extras:The Decor!!! They also serve the concept of pairing burgers with pies.The Verdict:I haven't felt the want to go back since this experience (which took place many months ago), mainly because the burger really wasn't that impressive. However, I do intend on returning at least once with a friend and dine in.

We are not asked how we would like the meat cooked, just what we want on or off the burger. When the burgers come, no plates, no utensils, just a burger wrapped in paper and in a small paper bag. The hickory sauce was nothing special as you can find better sauces at any grocery store. The menu has not changed since 1947 and it shows.

You can argue that In-N-Out burger is better, but you can't say that same place has been open since the 1940s and represents what LA is all about.This spot is a very historical LA eatery and is worth visiting, just to see. There's something about going to a place that has been around for ages that makes the experience great. The only complaint is the apple pie - I've had apple pie a la mode that is just as good, if not better. The $7 price tag doesn't help the cause very much. To sum it up, I would highly recommend this place just because it's part of old LA and it's something to see/do.

The Hickory Burger is easily the best burger I have ever had. Everything about it is absolute GOLD including but not limited to:The quality of the beefThe hand-cut super-cold lettuceThe tang of their signature Hickory sauceThe Tillamook cheddarThe fact that is is served in wrapped paper and not on a plateI can go on and onTheir tuna sandwich is clutch. The tuna salad has a sort of sweetness to it that you don't find often, I think they may make it with either sweet pickles or relish... anyways it's just out of this world GOOD. Also, you get a side of olives and sweet pickles on the side that taste excellent with random bites of the sandwich.Their pies are amazing. The apple pie is served at room temperature/maybe even lukewarm, and if you opt to get it with the fresh, whipped cream (YES, they have FRESH, whipped cream... not the canned crap) expect your taste buds to experience a nirvana that will make your eyes roll back into your head. I've also had their banana cream pie, chocolate cream pie, and pecan pie. I have to say, they are the masters of their domain... namely pie manufacturing. It's probably worth getting an entire pie to take home instead of a slice because of the cost. An entire pie will run you roughly $18-20 whereas a slice will cost around 5-6 bucks. I've previously ordered an entire pie and had them take out a slice to eat there, but last time our guy said he was unable to do that.. Regardless, I'll give it another shot next time.The atmosphere is pretty neat... kinda hard to explain but I'll try... imagine walking into a 50's no frills diner with muted colors (not like Johnny Rockets where everything looks all shiny). Looks 50's but make no mistake, the Apple Pan attracts a random mix of people from all walks of life. The workers are all business, don't expect to have a full-fledged conversation with any of them as they are extremely busy making sure everyone is cared for.

Don't get me wrong the burger itself is delicious, the meat was cooked just right at medium rare and the hickory sauce is a good blend of bbq with a sweet and sour hint.

I've been a fan of this quaint, little burger joint for awhile now, but just got off my lazy ass long enough to write a review. The burgers here are A-MAZ-ING. I'm a huge foodie at heart, and I can say with certainty that this place has one of the best burgers I've ever tried in LA. I usually get the Hickory burger, which is stuffed with fresh ingredients and their special sauce (kinda tastes like BBQ, only better). I pair this with their freshly fried fries (how's that for an alliteration?) and an ice cold cola. Then, I finish this off with a fat slice of either their banana cream pie or their apple pie (can't go wrong with either). For a meal like this, unfortunately, it rings up to about $20, but trust me, it is worth it!The few qualms I have about this place are about the parking and the seating (or lack thereof). Their lot is TINY (I guess it's reasonable considering the restaurant itself is pretty much miniature-sized), and there aren't too many spots on the street. Sometimes, I'll park across the street at the mall, but it's an inconvenient walk. Inside the diner, there are only counter seats, no booths or tables. I wouldn't recommend coming here in a group larger than 3, especially during their busiest times: dinner and weekends. If you do, be prepared to wait a longggg time. One more thing, actually. I like good service when I go to a restaurant, and I just don't get that here. There's a grumpy old man who takes the orders and brings the food, and I don't think I've ever seen him crack a smile in the 5+ times I've been here.

It is PACKED, constantly. Getting a seat here can take an hour or more during dinner. Second, the burgers are OK. Not bad, but certainly not exceptionally. They only have three, and none of them stand out. They are very small - I needed two to fill myself, and they cost 7 dollars a piece, meaning, if you are hungry, you will shell out 18 dollars here when tax and tip piles on. Third, for some reason, it is closed on Mondays. This makes absolutely no sense to me. Is this the DMV?This place is absolutely overrated. It is expensive, and the burgers are not worth it by any means.

There is nothing extraordinary about the meat or the bun; however, the quality of the meat, bun, and sauce do create an excellent hamburger.I recommend having the burger with cheese. Further, the burger comes with lettuce and pickles- I don't find that either of these garnishes adds much to the overall quality of the burger. The french fries are almost always a bit overdone; but, they bring them to you before the burger and they're nice to snack on. The waiter will give you some fresh ketchup too on a plate.

This was our experience in a nutshell. First Impression:Once we walked in, we stood against the wall waiting awkwardly watching everyone else eat along the curved counter but quickly found seats when a couple got up. \u00a0The \"waiter\" behind the counter who takes care of the patrons asked a couple people to move around to make room for others to sit down, so they made good use of their limited space. \u00a0The cash registers were antique and it gave the place a little character. \u00a0All food was served on paper plates and drinks were served in snow cone paper triangles. \u00a0That was about it as far as decor went. \u00a0We got about 1.5 seconds to look over the menu before ordering, but the menu is very basic so it wasn't too overwhelming. Our waiter was basically speedy gonzales and watching him was probably the most pleasant part of the whole experience.The food:The fries came out long before the burgers, so we didn't have to choose which one to eat first. \u00a0The fries were okay, basic regular frozen fries you would get at any cheap diner. We enjoyed them so much, the 2 of us didn't even finish one order. \u00a0The waiter quickly dumped a glob of ketchup on a paper plate next to the fries which I enjoyed very much. \u00a0As soon as our heap of ketchup began to diminish, another heap arrived. \u00a0When my water was finished, but before I could set my glass on the table, I had another full glass to tend to. \u00a0The waiter handled his business. \u00a0My girlfriend had the steak burger with a secret sauce that turned out to be sweet pickle relish and she was not pleased, but liked the lettuce. \u00a0I ordered the hickory burger, and it took me a second to find the meat peaking over the gigantic head of lettuce thrown in between two buns. \u00a0The burger tasted of lettuce, ketchup and mayonnaise \u00a0The burgers are served wrapped in paper. \u00a0Overall, the burger was fresh but not memorable at all. \u00a0You can find tons of better burgers for much cheaper. \u00a0 We split a slice of apple pie with ice cream and that was pretty good, the only saving grace of that place. \u00a0We at least enjoyed that part of the meal. \u00a0Overall:For 2 mediocre burgers, a plate of fries and a piece of pie, it cost us $26. \u00a0Definitely not worth it. \u00a0Don't plan on having a quiet, calm sit down meal with the waiter slamming things on the counter in front of you at a rapid pace and people staring over your shoulders waiting for a seat. \u00a0Glad I went? Sure. \u00a0Will I go again? \u00a0No way. \u00a0This place is super overrated, outdated and overpriced.
