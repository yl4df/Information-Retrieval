Salty fatty ham with a rich coffee gravy dip. This is a very large portion and I could not finish.The \u00a0fried potatoes with crab mayo was very good and more complex than expected. I could eat those all day.But, I really came for the Pork buns and wow!! Thick pork belly, steamed bum, hoison and saracha mmm you get 2 and want way more. The only miss was the Ssangria which was served in a wine glass with ice half filled which only probably get you 3 oz and it was not that good. It tasted like a cinnamon cider.

The food tasted good and while there were some techniques such as turning the bone marrow into a snow, the dishes in the end failed to be memorable enough for me to want to return and that's my litmus for most restaurants. I went for lunch so perhaps the dinner menu is more interesting.I am not a chef fanboy yet I have to admit I love hearing David Chang talk about food perhaps more than I love eating his food and I know he hates yelp but whatever just as he get to make whatever kind of food he wants people can post whatever they want about their food.I got the asparagus with bone marrow which was more pickled veggies with a small amount of asparagus and bone marrow served in a snow form. The bone marrow was pretty to see but I missed the pungency and texture of the bone marrow when it coats a vegetable. It was tasty but at 12 dollars not something I would order again.Then I had the duck over rice that I got with the lettuce and pancake so I could make happy bundle of joy. Duck is my favorite fowl. I've eaten it in at least 15 countries and as many ways as possible. The texture of the duck breast was spongy in a way I've never quite had before even with smoked and sous vide duck. It was bad just different. I was happy to have hoisin for the cake. Everything was underseasoned, a rather odd thing for a place listed as Korean. Underneath duck breast was some lovely duck meat that I mixed with the rice and sauce. This was better value than the aspargus at almost the same price.There was no wait and service was perfunctory. I was at the bar which was rather had to sit at with the narrow seats. The place is not design to be accessible to all.", "Date": "2014-07-06", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Annah T.", "ReviewID": "xK3nIgiFoDnWJGmRw6zYbw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was very excited to finally try a David Chang Restaraunt.

(300th review, woot!)Birthdays are a great excuse to bring a group of friends together for a big reservations and share some amazing food. Ss\u00e4m Bar had been on my friend's list for a while, so a late night reservation of 10 was set. We were all excited for the bo ss\u00e4m that awaited us.Once we were all seated, the gears were set into motion. Bowls upon bowls started coming from the kitchen: lettuce leaves, kimchi, hot sauce, minced chives in oil, rice, a tray of oysters, and the big centerpiece, a huge, hunking piece of pork butt.Eating was pretty self explanatory. You took a lettuce leaf and stuffed it with whatever suited your fancy. I tried multiple combinations, with and without rice, the different sauces, and oysters. The best combination in my opinion actually had a little bit of everything. The rice and meat provided substance and flavor, the kimchi added a much needed crunch and made it a little sour, the oyster added depth and a texture difference that made it that much more enjoyable. Wrap after wrap, I couldn't get enough of the food. The concept of pulling the pork off the bone was really cool too, adding to the experience.For 10 people, there was actually more than enough food. We did have majority girls, but everyone had their fair share and multiple people commented that they were stuffed. It was also surprisingly affordable: we each spent $32 after tax and tip and covered the birthday girl. Would I do it again? Maybe. I would need a large enough group to make it worth it, but nothing like food to bring people together!", "Date": "2014-06-16", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "JohnnyPrime.C.

I went with my wife and two friends from Tabelog. We rocked it. Check out the pics and details below.We started out with what we thought was a complimentary plate of sardines on toast with fermented chic peas and pickled hearts if palm. Why did we think it was complimentary, you ask? Because (1) we didn't fucking order it, and (2) the fucking waiter told us that he brought it out to us because he wanted us to try his favorite item. I'm not gonna complain any more than dropping two F-bombs, but needless to say I was a little confused and pissed when I saw the bill and realized we were charged for it (after leaving and already paying, kind you). The app was great. Salty, juicy, earthy, \"umami,\" and all that good shit. But there was plenty of meat, potatoes and greens to go around with the rib eye special that we didn't need an app. Now, the waiter was great and all, but a surprise charge like this, couched in \"freebie\" behavior, is kinda fucked up. Okay that's three F-bombs now.I'll leave the meat for last... aside from dessert, of course. The art of anticipation...Next was the bowl of perfectly fried french fries. Delicious. They came with a nice, smokey bacon ketchup too. Crispy outside, mashed potatoes inside. Mmmmm.Then a massive Caesar salad with brown butter croutons. Crisp and refreshing.Okay now for the blowout. This is a 107oz hunk of GODmeat. Dry aged for 50 days, originally hailing from the Niman farm in California, this cut of rib contains the outer fat slabs as well as what you normally get with a traditional cut of rib eye + fat cap.Here are some before shots:It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, allowed to cool, and then sliced and plated on a thick cutting board. Some of the fat was the grizzled kind, but much of it was the edible, meat bubble gum kind. Savory beef jelly. Awesome.It was served with four sauces: the bacon ketchup mentioned earlier, a bernaise sauce, a red wine + shallot marmalade, and rendered steak fat + brown butter and herbs.Also, four bundles of roasted garlic cloves, so soft that you could smear the garlic on your steak like creamy mashed potatoes or some shit.Was all this enough? Nope. Of course not. I'm a former fat guy. So we followed up with some dessert.First was a popcorn cake. Instead of sifting flower I'm the pre-baking process, they sifted popcorn. It was really unique, and served with a little side bowl of strawberry jam to spread across each forkfull. All I can say is that you should get it if you go here.And finally we had the Thai tea pie. This cold dessert had the unique characteristic flavor of Thai tea with an added tangy tamarind sauce and some sort of chocolatey, tea-infused puffed rice kinda thing on top. Nice.So that's all. Great fucking meal, aside from the fact that I was charged for something that we didn't order. On the slightly brighter side of things, however, it looks as though they forgot to charge us for our third beer. So we were still overcharged, but only by $9 instead of $15", "Date": "2014-06-26", "Author_Location": "Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "Amrita G.", "ReviewID": "V2ARzzQHSgRMDWKPu5mWTg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Amazing pork belly buns.

Well, I am here to say that apparently Yelp works pretty perfectly because that is exactly what this place deserves.

The rice cakes and spicy pork sausage is a surprisingly excellent, if not a little overly oily and heavy dish. Definitely try this if you come here, it is kind of like fried gnocchi with a ragu sauce made of sausage.The lamb ssam is great here but the ssams all feel kinda like half-burritos and then I start thinking about Mission Cantina.

Surprisingly so, this place is supposedly an institution, but in my opinion doesn't live up to the hype. I watch David Chang on \"mind of a chef\" and he seems like a cool guy. But I have mixed feelings, he hates on California food, and as someone from LA, in my short experiences in NY, I think LA is much better for food in the short time I had to compare. Dollar for dollar you can eat well and cheap in LA, not what I experienced in NY, ie $20 lox bagels (wtf), and this place was the crowning piece on expensive but not very good food. Maybe it's because NY has inferior ingredients to California, who knows. So momofoku, $13 for bread and butter. Hey David Chang, that's usually free in other places. So you'd figure if they charge for it, it's special. Well, its not. The butter is good but, its nothing to write home about and the baguette was old.The waiter told me not to check yelp for suggestions to take his word, I wish I looked at yelp first because nothing here did it for me, except the duck.

After the price I paid for a mediocre meal, I should be able to do whatever I want. Well, let's start from the top.Uni - The dish consists of uni, roe, tofu, and wasabi peas. Well, the uni, roe, and tofu are all basically the same texture (if you don't know, basically imagine butter in your mouth). So the wasabi peas give it the crunch it needs, right? Well, yes but it also makes the dish inedible. The peas are too spicy and ruin the taste. Very, very disappointed.Pork Buns - It's probably because I had just had Ippudo and Totto's pork buns but these did not compare. Not only that, I'm pretty sure these cost the most per bun of the three locations. Not worth it.Rice Cakes and Sausage - For those who know Korean food, it's basically ddukbokki with small pieces of sausage. HOWEVER, there is some really earthy, bitter aftertaste after each bite. I couldn't figure out which ingredient it was but it ruined the entire dish for me.Mackerel - I don't think you can mess up mackerel but this was one of the best mackerel dishes I've ever had. Inside it was soft, outside it was crispy with just the right amount of sauce.1/4 dishes basically earns this a 2 star review. The service was standard but not extraordinary.

And the end of the night, I wanted to be able to say that I at least liked it. But for the experience, food, service and price? It'll take a little more convincing.We stopped in on a weekday night, waited a while to be seated. The hostess seated us and then poof, gone.To start us off, we ordered the roasted baby beets (sunflower hozon, ham, raisin) and steamed buns (pork belly, hoisin, cucumber scallion). The beets were presented in a lovely deconstructed way that got points for creativity and color, but demerits for taste (everything was swimming in peanut sauce) and...usability? (Good grief. It shouldn't take a good deal of effort to put things together to eat.) The steamed buns were fatty, tender and delicious with light and fluffy buns. Absolutely amazing.For entrees, we had the dry aged niman ranch ribeye (with shallot, garlic and thyme) and the roasted jurgielewicz duck (with barley, butternut squash, and cranberry). Both did not impress. The ribeye was cold, lacking any noticeable flavor or evidence that it was a thoughtful or well plated dish. I also wished that the menu had specified the fact that it was pork ribeye rather than beef. The duck was room temperature, chewy, and flavorless with a thick fatty skin. The barley, squash and cranberry were void of any depth of flavor (or complementing flavors for that matter), the lifeless hard, texture of the squash and sourness of the cranberry clashing at every bite. Maybe it's because I'm beholden to Baker & Banker in San Francisco for showing me what good duck is.The atmosphere was moody, mysterious and great for loud and large groups. Rustic, industrial and modern. But it felt cold rather than intimate, chaotic rather than trendy. The service? Some servers seemed uncertain, hesitating in answering questions about the menu or drinks. Others seemed uncomfortable and jumpy, scurrying over and disappearing without a word. It all felt a little disjointed and unsettling. Overall, I was disappointed that Momofuku Ssam didn't live up to my hopes.

Knowing they don't take reservation unless we r getting the pork or duck group dinner has deterred us from coming (there's always a crowd of people outside the restaurant and waiting is just no fun!) But after we found ourselves waking up pretty late one Sunday afternoon and learned that they now serve brunch, we thought we would push our luck and see if we missed the rush. We got there around 1:30 pm (actually not that late) and scored the last table by the open kitchen. As we were led to the table, we couldn't help but stared at the size of the pre-order duck/pork feast being devoured by the big groups. Since there are only the three of us, we decided it was best to just order a few dishes to share- Peaky toe crab, smoked salmon buns, duck bacon egg tacos, and duck over rice with a side of chive pancakes. My fianc\u00e9 and his brother also ordered sparkling apple cider. At first they were a bit disappointed at how small each glass was but our servers later gave us two complimentary refills (not necessary because the service was amazing already, def bonus points!). The Peaky toe crab was similar to naruto roll with sprinkle of apple sorbet and cilantro over the top. It was light and refreshing but we felt that the dish itself was a bit overpriced (5 small pieces for $16). Pork belly buns are huge in Momofuku and many ramen/Japanese restaurants in the city - but I decided to give the smoked salmon bun a try (don't see these on menus everyday!) and ended up being my personal fav. They charred the exterior of the buns to give it a nice touch of crispness. Each bun was loaded with a generous serving of fatty salmon. The chopped egg and mayo added a nice creaminess to the crisp. The duck bacon tacos - for some reason I imagined them to be more eggy with sprinkles of bacon bits. Instead there were strips and strips of thick cut bacon. Each taco must had had 4 full strips. I don't eat bacon but my fianc\u00e9' and his brother seemed to really enjoy it. We were a bit underwhelmed by the duck over rice. We felt that we could easily find a place in Chinatown for the same or even better dish. It was good but unmemorable. The chive pancake was bit dry but much better than most greasy ones I've had at home and in the city. Overall solid food and service.

The hostess told us about 20-25 mins, so we went across the street to a bar to grab a drink, and were called within 10 mins (actually texted via their wait list service).  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My boyfriend and I ordered an order of pork buns (2 per order), diver scallop tatami, soft shell crab, and the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes. My friends ordered the pork buns, scallop dish, and rice cake dish as well, with the garlic roasted quail. The pork buns were pretty good. We've had pork buns at ippudo before, which I love, but these pork buns had two pork belly slices on hoisin sauce with slices of cucumber. I like the cucumber idea as opposed tot he piece of iceberg lettuce in ippudo's pork buns. The pork belly slices here were pretty big, and very tender and juicy. I would come back and have their pork buns again. The sauce isn't overpowering at all, and it's all in the right balance for a tasty item. The scallop tataki was good as well. The scallops were good actually. But the dish itself could have used more flavoring. It was basically scallops in some sort of liquid that looked like lemon juice - I expected a sour taste eating my first bite of the scallop, but was surprised to find not much of flavoring anywhere. The soft shell crab was in a pimento cheese sauce. It was something different. There's two pieces to the order, and I just think it was a lot for us because we had ordered 4 dishes. The pimento cheese was a nice touch. I liked it when I had my first half of a piece, but started getting a little tired of it by the second piece, because it was a fried item, and maybe two pieces was too much, or I should have ordered less. The spicy pork sausage and rice cakes dish was pretty good at first. It had a lot of flavor, and the rice cakes seemed to have been fried or so beforehand, because there was a crunch to at least one end of them. The thing with this dish was that the sausage bits were very little compared to the rice cakes. It was like minced meat, and it was a bit too salty for my taste in this dish. The rice cakes definitely out numbered the sausage, and because of all the carbs, after everything we ate prior, it was hard to finish the whole dish. I would recommend trying it though, because it's definitely different, but just pair it with the right amount of items and you should be fine and better able to enjoy it.  \u00a0 \u00a0 My friend's quail dish looked pretty funny. It looked like anorexic quail. The pieces were so small, but the presentation was very nice. According to them the anorexic quail did taste very good, but for the amount of the dish, I would've thought there would be more quail when looking at it. It looked like half a quail was cut into 4 or 5 pieces at served. Quail is already small enough, so if I'm talking half a quail here, that's pretty small.  \u00a0 \u00a0Overall, this was a great experience. The food items were pretty good. Just make sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach and you'll be okay. All the food we ordered could easily be shared by 2 people - I normally don't eat a lot anyway, which could be why.

Still, I'll give it a go.Went with 8 other people on a Saturday at 11PM (the only time we could get a reservation). Is that too late for dinner? Not at all! We just got the bo ssam ($200), no extras, and barely managed to finish the whole thing.The first bite of pork was unforgettable. The skin had caramelized into a slightly crispy layer of porky goodness. It wasn't too fatty (unlike chicken skin) and the flavors were balanced -- the only downside was that there's only one layer, and it goes fast. Deeper inside, the pork shoulder was tender and easily shredded. The addition of lettuce and sauces is crucial; the marinade doesn't penetrate to every part of the large hunk of meat, which could lead to a slightly repetitive eating experience. The raw oysters added an interesting fishy element, which dollar-oyster enthusiasts will love and the oyster-inexperienced (such as myself) will likely forget as simply one bite out of many. Of the four sauces, ginger-scallion stood out the most. It's a flavor combination more commonly found in Chinese cuisine, but the bright ginger notes and mild oiliness pair well with the robust pork and taste great mixed with the other sauces as well. The ss\u00e4m sauce was a bit of a disappointment: overpoweringly salty and not spicy enough. For Korean-inspired food, the bo ss\u00e4m could've used a kick in the chili department. Lighting is minimal; the brightly lit kitchen casts a short-reaching glow that makes food photography futile. (Inveterate bloggers and Instagrammers should come for lunch.)

Even though the Bo Ssam needs to be pre-ordered ahead of time, we still had to wait a good half hour after we were seated, and were all starving. Our waiter had brought out lettuce, sauces, rice and a dozen oysters to accompany the pork while we were waiting and we tried not to eat them in our hunger.Then finally, the pork butt arrived... and it was glorious! Sweet, succulent, and oh-so-tender, each bite of the pork released the most delicious juices in my mouth. This was definitely the best pork butt I've ever had! Everything else however, just didn't add much to the experience. The oyster's cold slimey texture tasted odd with the soft and fatty pork and I would have enjoyed a pancake wrap more than a lettuce wrap. I also felt the sauces and kimichi tasted below the average Ktown joint. Momofuku's Bo Ssam is one of those things that you have to try at least once in your life, just to say you've experienced it.

I'm considering coming in for lunch sometime and spending $20 on 2 orders of pork buns alone. I appreciate that they serve Tiger beer. It's a tasty choice for a foreign beer that won't drive up the check too high. I have no problem buying artisan drinks once in a while, but I like having the option of choosing something cheaper and different.Their kimchi is presented in charming small jars, and it was delicious. I thought maybe they could package up the jars and sell them. I'd buy it, definitely.I was a fan of the entrees and the presentation was elegant. I was so blown away by the pork buns though that I'll be dreaming of those for weeks. I eyeballed the bo ssam coming out of the kitchen and laying on a table. It looked incredible. All I want is to go back with a group of people and experience it myself. Our server was a friendly British man, and he seemed very genuine.

The pork buns were every bit as delicious as they \u00a0talked up to be, the pork belly just melts in your mouth and buns had a great texture. Then came the duck which was just as delicious -- simply seared and served over a couscous with some pistachios, cranberries, and butternut squash. Cooked perfectly medium rare with a crispy skin, I couldn't ask for more. At the end of the evening, I left a happy diner. I loved the food, and the unpretentious atmosphere. The people here just want to serve you good food and thats what they do. The only reason I do not give Momofuku 5 stars is perhaps I've been a little spoiled as a Chinese American growing up in Queens. I still remember the days when I could head to Flushing after school and pick up a steamed roast duck bun on Main Street. The duck buns are very similar to the steamed pork buns -- same steamed bun with cucumbers and scallions with a piece of roast duck and some hoisin sauce. They were every bit as delicious as the pork buns, the only difference being that they were a dollar each instead of two for $10 at momofuku.

I wanted to try the Momofuku chain for the longest time. Even when we were driving to the restaurant, I kept saying \"I can't wait!!\" with a big grin on my face. The only downfall was that our reservation was at 10pm. Seriously... who makes reservations at 10pm on a weeknight??? Apparently, our foodie host does. He booked the reservation a month in advance for their infamous duck feast and boy were we in for a real treat. The meal feeds about 4 people, 6 if you have light eaters. The waitress first brought out the whole roasted duck rested on a bed of greens to give it its grand royal display, as it deserves! She went off giving us the background of this lovely bird (where it was raised and etc), we were so memorized by the delicious crispy goodness in front of us that we didn't even hear half the stuff she said. I think she said our duck was raised in Long Island.... While it was cooking, we ordered the steam pork buns to start and share. The pork belly was wrapped in a little white fluffy pillow, sandwiched in between hoison sauce and greens and super tender. Put a little sriracha on it for a kick. Yum. Asked our waiter for a red wine recommendation and he suggested the Blaufrankisch 2011, which has a medium body, to pair with our meal. Is it sweet? Slightly. Perfect for me. It went really well with the duck. The waiter did not steer us wrong! I liked the presentation of the duck feast. Duck breast was sliced into two rows under a bed of white rice, sesame pancake wraps and herbs (basil, mint, sage, cilantro and watercrest) on the side. It also came with a bowl of lettuce to wrap and toppings such as fried and sauteed shallots, hoison sauce, korean bbq sauce. What I love about this is different variations you can make and you get down and dirty to make your food. So many delicious choices.Note: the sesame pancakes were very greasy. Avoid. Overall, I enjoyed the entire experience from start to finish. 3.5 stars.

They don't have too many tables. I want to say 4-6 four tops and maybe 2 huge tables for bigger groups or maybe they just pushed a couple tables together. Otherwise they have a counter facing the bar or a double sided counter closer to the kitchen where you can sit facing each other. The latter is where my friend and I ended up. Oh and they have the hooks underneath the counter to hang your jacket or purse. Love the convenience. Yeah, anyways when we went, all the tables were occupied and the counters were about half full. I only saw two waitresses working as well as a busboy. The kitchen had at least 4 chefs/guys and it didn't look all that big either. I had looked on their website and the bo ssam (pork shoulder) dinner looked really good but unfortunately it feed like 8 - 10 people. Next time with a huge group. We spilt the pork belly buns. Good but not the best I've ever had. Very nice fatty flavorful pork belly. For the entrees, I ended up with the OG momfuku ssam and my friend had the fish ssam (forgot the name). I thought I had ssam before in LA and it was like meat in lettuce cups. These are not that. Mine was like a giant burrito and my friend's was like soft taco with fried and battered fish. Yeah so maybe I didn't actually have ssam before. I was a bit worried about my ssam as I'm not a huge fan of kimchi and I almost asked for them to make it without it. But I decided to give it a try. It was delicious. Lots of tender pork, lots of rice, some veggies and a heapload of kimchi. I ate about half of it before the heat got to me and I had to start removing the kimchi. Whoo. But it was so good. And this was like a giant burrito so I had trouble finishing it. The maybe last few bites, I just ate the pork. Along with my pork belly bun and this ssam, I was stuffed. The table next to us had the rotisserie duck bowl with rice and a wrap. That looked really good too. Service was great. I did have to ask for a refill on water once.

So here's my obligatory review about how great David Chang is:We got the big duck meal, and let me tell you, there is just something outrageous about it. Outrageously good, yes, but also just regular variety outrageous outrageous. It's a huge amount of food--I totally understand if you're tempted to branch out for the famous pork buns, as we did, but I promise you there is more than enough food with the duck and the pancakes and the sides, and it all rocks. If you love duck, this is a meal that you will not soon forget. I loved making up all the little pancakes with lots of fresh cilantro, mint and basil, and the different parts of the duck, topped off with crispy dried shallots and some hoisin or hot sauce. The crispy skin, the savory meat and the unctuous fat... Or instead of the pancakes, wrapping up a bundle in crisp butter lettuce--all so delicious. It's also a fun experience to share with friends, and a reasonably good deal. They say its for three to six people.

But I think I hyped it up too much in my head, so that when I actually got to come here with friends, it wasn't what I expected. First thing ordered was the steamed pork belly buns. Everyone says you have to try it right? I'm a big bao fan. If I see a new bao place anywhere near me, I have to try it. Soo the Pork Belly in the buns were great, with a nice amount of the fat, but the actual buns didn't seem fresh or soft as I hoped them to be. After eating at Ippudo the day before, and having their heavenly almost like marshmellow cloud steamed buns, I wasn't amazed with Momofuku's buns. They're pretty good, but not at the top of my list. Second thing ordered was a softshell crab salad. I feel like they were being stingy with the amount of soft shell crab pieces given. At least if you're going to be stingy \u00a0and pricey about it, make it taste amazing. But it wasn't like that.For the main lunch entree, ordered the rotisserie duck over rice (duck scallion, ss\u00e4m sauce, crispy shallot). This was pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. For dessert, ordered the whiskey thai tea cake truffles. Honestly, they can get rid of that. They should have added the crack pie to their menu.

Although you may not want to believe so, it's for good reason.I've now had my fair share of meals at Momofuku, and although I had one slightly disappointing experience, it was heavily outweighed by the marvelous ones. First I came here with my partner and we ordered the standard buns, a noodle small plate, and the rice cakes. The buns were out of control delicious, as they typically are, but the rice cakes were so hot they were nearly impossible to enjoy. My next experience was with a large group ordering a nice selection of entrees and small plates from the menu. The pork buns came out too cold, as was my pork loin dish. The rice cakes, which I tasted again were far less hot and really quite tasty. Having spent a good penny on this meal, I left disappointed due to food temps. The last time I patronized Momofuku was a gift from God. A friend of mine was returning to medical school from summer vacation and his parents treated himself and his friends (me, oh my yes), to a ssam dinner. This was by far one of the best meals I've ever eaten; the best pork I've ever consumed hooves down. You really cannot beat sampling from this large, large piece of pork. We were a party of six that came starving, gauged ourselves, and left stuffed. I have never packed my stomach to it's brim quite like this before...then I stupidly had some cereal milk at Milk Bar and took the bus home. The feeling of intense regret that overtook my body as soon as I hit my couch was unreal and let me tell you...it was worth it.

You take the pork and wrap it into lettuce leaves with oysters, kimchee, and a host of Asian condiments and stuff it in your mouth and it is porktastic.

We were also served the steamed buns that has become synonymous with the Momofuku brand, and the duo of pillowy bao and fatty pork never fails to satisfy.Dessert was less impressive.

When I took the first bite, I kid you not, I wanted to cry. It was as though everything I had eaten in my life up to that point had little purpose but to prepare me for that moment.

They bring out a massive platter of mostly duck breast, stuffed with duck and pork sausage, along with some duck leg confit. It's all on a bed of a ton of really good rice, with some greens and some chive pancakes, which were boiling hot and really really good. There is also a bowl of bibb lettuce for making wraps, along with several dipping sauces (hoisin, chili paste, garlic and duck fat).

Small Portion. We were 3 people and there were 2 buns.Sweet Breads- I forget the exact preparation but they weren't the best Ive had. I'd say they were unfortunately some of the \"not better\" ones I've had.Rice Cakes with Spicy Sausage and Chinese Broccoli- I found this to be overwhelmingly spicy. It had a kick. I love spicy and heat, but it was borderline overpowering. I'm not looking for overpowering when I'm going to a fancy Asian fusion place. Not much sausage. The broccoli was good and added a nice texture compared to the glutinous rice cakes and mushy-like sausage in sauce. This dish left me feeling full. The chewy glutinous rice cakes made my stomach hurt.Unfortunately I found it forgettable. It took me a few months to write this review because, well, I kinda forgot about it. I liked it, but I was expecting so much more from the way reviewers were tooting Ssam Bar's horn. It's glorified Asian Fusion Cuisine. I guess I should stick to authentic Asian cuisine.

You gotta have at least 1 meal at 1 of his restaurants when visiting the Big Apple. My winter gastronomic itinerary was too darn packed for me to squeeze in another reservation at Momofuku Ko and i thought it was lost to me till the next trip. Thankfully there is Momofuku Ssam Bar and their no reservations policy, we tried our luck and managed to get a table on our last day in the city. O the happiness when we saw only a short queue. Whee! Momofuku Ssam Bar serves an unpretentious Asian comfort food with a duck-dominated menu. This is a casual joint where you can simply pop in for a quick meal or a snack or 2 for 20 bucks and leave really satisfied physically and emotionally because the food is ingenious and vibrant. Yes eating is an emotional thing for me.For lunch, there is a 3 course Prix Fixe meal for US$25.The Striped Bass was picked from a list of 3 appetizers which included Fuji Apple Kimchi and Steamed (Pork) Buns. All are great choices and come recommended. I would say go for the famous Momofuku Pork buns if you have not eaten that before. As we already had that bun at Momofuku Milk Bar, we decided to try something different. The bass was very fresh and the texture was sublime. Interesting rice pops to give the carpaccio an added crunchy texture. This is seasoned with plum, cilantro, green peppercorn. Very refreshing.Charred Octopus didn't seem like a very good choice. You should ALWAYS do duck at Ssam. The octopus was grilled to a crispy exterior but i found it very bland even all that stuff going on the plate. When i saw that the other tables had the kong ba bao version, i wondered if the bun that i had at Momofuku Milk Bar was the same Momofuku Pork Bun (seriously..) The one at Milk is a pulled pork version in a different bun. Not sure if it's because i added an egg with it but you can't blame me for thinking that they were different! Anyway, they tasted about the same with the hoisin sauce, cucumbers and scallions. The textures were a little different and i kinda like Milk's version better as it seemed a juicier.Now, you gotta have my absolute favorite dish, which is the Rotisserie Duck Over Rice ($14). I felt that the duck was very interesting as a flavored minced duck scallion patty was sandwiched between the caramelized skin and the pink tender meat. Add a little of the sweet hoisin sauce with some chili and the taste is absolutely heavenly and very Vietnamese. I added a chives pancake on the side ($2) and wrapped the meat in the salty flaky dough and it became an interpretation of a modern Peking Duck wrap.The Chevre Sorbet was a terrible terrible choice from the lunch set. We should have gone with the safer Lemon Meringue Pie. There's simply too much going on. We didn't finish this and went to Milk bar (which is around the corner) to have our favorite Cereal Milk Soft Serve and Crack Pie. :) Remember, whatever you do, you GOT TO HAVE the duck rice at Momofuku Ssam Bar.

Restrooms are available towards the back of the restaurant. As our order came out, each dish was described to us as it was placed on our table. We started off with Steamed Duck Buns, Pork Buns and Honeycrisp Apple Kimchi. The buns were served warm and fluffy. The meats were juicy and melt in your mouth good. All the flavors and textures made the Honeycrisp Apple Kimchi a hit. Thick slices of clean crisp sweet apples coated with spicy chili. Peppery arugula, crisp smokey jowl bacon, sweet creamy maple labne. A drizzle of olive oil and ground pepper complete this dish. Highly recommended. The Rotisserie Duck Over Rice was simply that. Flavors were all on point and freshness was key. Rice was fluffy and sticky. Juicy slices of thick duck cooked to perfection. Had just the right amounts of fat. Not overly greasy, with lots of flavor. You can add lettuce and/or a chive pancake to the dish. The lettuce was super fresh, cool and crisp. Goes perfectly with the duck. The chive pancake is crisp around the edges but soft within. A light onion flavor.We enjoyed the Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes but did find it to be incredibly rich. This dish should definitely be shared. Loads of spice from the sichuan peppercorns and chili oil. The rice cakes were tender and incredibly filling. Tender pieces of Chinese broccoli and spicy pork sausage. Topped off with cool green onions and crisp fried onions. I enjoyed the spicy flavor but if they could cut back on the oil it could make this dish a bit lighter. It was warm and comforting though.Corn Ice Cream Pie w/ Raspberries and Thai Basil was a light way to end our filling meal. Cool and refreshing. Pretzel Cake Truffles were salty, sweet, buttery and gooey. We left incredibly satisfied and with a take out box.Note: If you enjoy Coca Cola and haven't tried Mexican Coca Cola as yet, try it here.

The spicy pork sausage and rice cakes passed by our table and looked so good we decided we simply must try them. This is definitely a spicy dish but oh so, so tasty. The rice cakes are about the size of cut carrots and the same color but when you put it in your mouth you get a hit of chili, crispy exterior and chewy interior. Sublime. I would eat a whole bowl of just those rice cakes. The hubs ordered the quail which was perfectly juicy and tender with an incredible depth of flavor. The grilled pineapple was a nice compliment to the bird. Then we ordered the tilefish with curry sauce and mussels. While I was chatting with my cousin my husband surripticiously ate all the mussels.

The hubby calls and leaves them a message telling them that our party is reduced to 2. They call us back and ask if we want to cancel or if we still want to keep our reservation. UM, NOOOOO we will not cancel. Hubby has been looking forward to this meal for weeks -- no way is he canceling. So we showed up.

However, the real star of our meal for me was actually the Spicy Pork + Rice Cakes. I've never eaten a dish like this and it was a really great collection of veggies, meat, and rice cakes - the latter of which is fried, but so light in taste and texture you could definitely go through a whole bowl of this without feeling that unfavorable heaviness that usually accompanies fried foods. Honorable mentions also go out to the Shanghai Noodle, which was very cool and refreshing with its sugar snaps and roe, and the Penicillin, which was pretty stiff with its scotch, but very fragrant and just sweet enough because of the honey/ginger/lemon mix that accompanied it. (The latter was so good I ordered it twice!)With its bar along the back wall, community seating tables, kitchen view, and modern but dark interior, Momofuku Ssam almost feels like a gastropub.

Everyone was able to eat about 4 -5 wraps, and it was enough for everyone to be full and extremely happy.We couldn't stop raving about how good the meal was. It was delicious, plentiful, and engages the entire table in conversation and interaction. For $200, the Bo Ssam fed all 10 of us, not including tax and tip. If you don't mind losing a couple days of your lifespan to gastronomical delight, you should definitely try it with a party of 6-10 (10 guests maximum) who will appreciate all the porky goodness.

There's nothing really that special about the bun itself, but the pork is incredibly tender and fatty. My friend and I decided to get one of the ham plates as well, and we were surprised at how much meat they give you! Granted, the ham is sliced into very thin shavings, but the meat slices cover a fairly large plate. The ham was tasty and fun to eat, but it really wasn't anything spectacular. I'm not entirely sure what kind of sauce it came with, but it really didn't taste like anything. Unless you're really into ham or you're some kind of meat connoisseur, I probably wouldn't recommend getting the ham plates.For my main course, I ordered the pork shoulder steak, which I absolutely loved! The meat itself is pretty thin, but it is cooked perfectly and is wonderfully juicy. What I loved about this dish was the bleu cheese sauce that the steak and vegetables sit on. It was a light sauce that had just the mildest hints of bleu cheese flavor, and it perfectly accented the savoriness of the meat. The bleu cheese was not overpowering at all, and I think even people who aren't usually a fan of the dressing would enjoy this sauce. The shishito peppers and vegetables were also delicious. The way they were cooked added a nice little bit of char to each vegetable, giving them an extra bit of crunch and flavor to accent the freshness and the taste.My friend got the roasted duck dinner, so I was able to try a few pieces of that as well. The entree itself did not seem to contain a huge amount of meat (understandable given that it's duck), so if you're really hungry, I would maybe reconsider getting this dish. If you like eating duck though, this is a great entree! The few pieces of duck I tried were marvelously tender and fatty.If you're a cocktail fan, the Viva La Vida is pretty tasty. If you're into drinks that have a little bit of peppery spice and kick to them, give it a try. I was not as big a fan of the Lamprey, which tasted more like straight liquor than a cocktail.As for the restaurant itself, the actual dining room seems pretty small. If you're not there with a large group, you'll most likely be relegated to sitting at the bar. Fret not though. The bar extends for quite a bit, so there is a portion of the bar where you can sit on the bartender's side (across from your friend/date). The clear downside here is that you won't have that much elbow room when it's busy and all the other seats are occupied.The service here is actually not that great. I guess this speaks to how busy they are most of the time? (Although that really doesn't absolve them from poor service.) My friend and I sat for 15 minutes before a server even came to inquire about drinks, and we almost didn't believe that he was our server. None of the waitstaff here wears any kind of distinguishing or matching clothing, so there will literally be guys dressed in different colored shorts and graphic t-shirts taking your orders. There is almost no way to tell the difference between servers and customers (except maybe that the customers tend to be dressed nicer than the servers).On the plus side, the hostess was incredibly pleasant and welcoming. I have seriously never seen a woman who looked so genuinely happy to be able to seat you.Holy crap this was a long review.Long story short. Awesome food. Go for the pork buns, the duck, and the pork shoulder steak.

I found it good, but not great, though I'll probably check out the rest of David Chang's empire at some point. The Ssam bar is a heaven of meat dishes, ranging from the raw, to the fish, and to the bo ssam(basically a whole butt). I did like the ambiance of the place, since it was very casual and laid back; though it was dark, I appreciated how popular the place was(I came at 9:30 and people kept pouring in.) Since it was sort of a late meal, and because I planning on hitting up the milk bar across the street with a friend, I only ordered the spicy pork sausage with rice cakes, essentially David Chang's re imagining of Ddukboki.(I regret not getting the pork buns, since those are heavily hyped, but I'm sure I will the next time I come).Though the portion wasn't very large, the sausage and the rice cakes were alright. It doesn't look very \"korean\", though I did ask for extra heat on mine, so it was pretty spicy. The sausage wasn't what i expected, since it was cut into such small pieces with the thick sauce I could have imagined it as a pasta sauce. I also sampled my friend's shanghai noodle, which was much more delicate, perhaps less comfort food and more of something original.Anyhow, I think this is an incomplete review of a popular restaurant, and I'm sure I'll be back.

When we showed up early in the evening, the place was bustling, but not jam-packed. Perfect. We were led to the bar - sure, not a problem. I was never a huge fan of eating at a table with strangers, anyway. Unsurprisingly, the cocktail menu looked good. As we were planning to hit a cocktail den later, however, we passed. The order of the night for us was going to be a few plates of small bites, then one of the famed desserts. I've been a fan of pig ears ever since one of my hometown restaurants started featuring them prominently, so we had to order the Crispy Pig Ear Ssam here. Prepared with yuzu and Thai basil, it was light, fresh, crunchy - absolutely perfect. Plus, I came to realize that I had never truly tasted \"yuzu\" before this. I swear that plenty of \"Asian Fusion\" places throw the idea of yuzu on their menus to make their menu items sound fancy and justify high prices, but it's funny, whenever I order such items, I never taste anything. Here, I finally understand what yuzu tastes like. I knew it was supposed to be a citrus fruit, and with this dish, I definitely tasted a good pungent tart citrus flavor. Now I know. And next time someone claims to use yuzu in a dish, and I don't taste it, they're getting marked down.Pork buns were fine - succulent pork, check...once again, bright flavors, textural perfection, check - but hey, they are pork buns. Grab an order just to say you had them, and then move on to the more interesting menu items. Like the Roasted Goat Roulade....a nice slab of densely savory goat meat with bulgur, lima beans, and egg yolk. This was pretty odd, but it worked, and was ultimately the kind of interesting dish for which we had hoped. For dessert, it was Christina Tosi's famed corn ice cream pie with raspberries and Thai basil. I think that the use of corn in desserts is one of those foodie trends, one I'm happy to indulge, as it adds a flavor dimension not normally associated with end of meal sweets. Sweet, tart, and with that little basil kick, this is the kind of dessert I'd come back to.

I won't say that it's not the same here - and I won't say there are some obvious flaws to the Chinese food (chive pancakes included) they serve there, but the one thing that I can say is that this place does their MEAT well.

The brown sugar dry rub was perfect and added a great sweetness to the pork. The lettuce was really fresh and crisp but unfortunately they did not give us enough of it (we had to keep on asking for more, and after a while they just stopped listening to us).

As my boyfriend would put, it's a \"one-time\" try. And it is conveniently 10 steps around the corner from Momofuku milk, so you can kill two birds with one stone. However, I'm a bigger fan of their Noodle bar. Ssam is a Korean word for \"wrap\", which explains the menu's various bun selection, \"bo ssam\", and \"duck ssam\". However, considering that their concept is to imitate and infuse traditional Korean flavors into the buns and ssams, Momofuku has done a poor job at doing so. The buns remind me of the cheaper equivalents sold at Bao Haus, Ippudo, Jum Mom, and food carts. It is delicious, but very Chinese. It is not a Korean dish and does not infuse any Korean flavors. They offer two types of ssam- bo ssam and duck ssam. The duck ssam is a smaller entree, compared to the bo ssam, which is meant to feed about 4-6 people. The duck ssam is served with bibb lettuce, and can be accompanied by a scallion pancake or sticky white rice (you can chose to ask for both or either or). First and foremost, Korean ssam is usually enjoyed by wrapping a meat, a variety of veggies, with a little bit of red pepper paste or soybean paste. SOOOOOO, could you imagine my frustration when we were served a bowl of rice topped with rotisserie duck meat and confit? Oh, and the scallion pancake isn't a Korean original! My Chinese boyfriend confirmed that it was a \"very Chinese\" dish- the pancake that Momofuku Ssam served was thinner and oilier than the recognizably Korean scallion pancakes. The Bo Ssam was a lot more closer in presentation and taste to the actual Korean dish. Also, I did not like the Shanghai noodles at all. It was very sour and there wasn't much sustenance to the entree. It was very hard to eat and after a chopstick-full, I stopped eating it altogether. The eggs and shoots did not add any value to the dish, in my humble opinion.Other than the Shanghai noodles, the other entrees were good.

The long-table concept is cool but we got stuck next to an older couple (retired stockbroker who felt it upon himself to flick food from their shared plates to ours so we could try it)....their party was slightly intoxicated. \u00a0It was a bit offensive. He threw the food at us. Everyone around us was staring and in awe. Thankfully they left and a less obnoxious group of girls sat next to us.I'm surprised i didn't fall ill from eating dirt.

Wouldn't you say it is the perfect dish? Just as good as it can possibly be.You may think you got it with the list of ingredients, but actually its not even close to what you are about to taste. For instance: Arctic Char Tataki with Peach, Pine nut, Celery and Lovage. The surprising factor came for me in form of the \"burn\" flavor. The skin is torched and it really gets that very intense smoky flavor, I felt like if I was liking charcoal or something. Which yeah, I know its weird. \u00a0To be disliked if its not balanced somehow, which is exactly how it was. Furthermore, a warm note on the dish that other than that, is refreshing and breathing sea and summer everywhere. The pine nuts, to break the texture resemble the same idea and also they seems to be matched in heaven with fruits like peaches. I thought briefly about a granola breakfast. I think I tasted it \u00a0for real. But it was definitely not, just a magical combination of white peach, ginger and vinegar, crispy and tasteful herbs selected to go along with the beautiful pieces of fish. We got the Seasonal Pickles almost at the same time. It was perfect and included mushroom, cauliflower, cucumber, \u00a0beets, radish, among other vegetables together with kimchee. Simple yet another highlight on the menu. A playful dish in color, texture and flavors, from spicy to bitter to sweet immersed in a delicate hint of vinegar. My favorite, the rainbow carrots since those are sweeter and crunchier. And the mushroom to add some creaminess. From the off cut menu we decided to try the Beef Tongue Sandwich seasoned with Mustard seeds and Capers and accompanied by a soup bowl that wasn't soup but meat juices with bone marrow to dip on it. Wild flavors. Its meaty and tangy , all wrapped on the perfect bread: a rye with nuts slightly toasted to make it crunchy. Finally, Spicy Pork Sausage and Rice Cakes together with Chinese Broccoli all seasoned in Sichuan Peppercorn. We were warmed this is spicy, and I was happy to confirm that they deliver on that department. I will always be fascinated by Chang's crispy rice cakes. Once again bold flavor and spicy on a Szechuan style. I was surrender already. And then the desserts rounds came. We decided to try both of the only ones offered. The Lemon Meringue Pie with pistachio and lemon curd was incredible. The part that perplexed me the most, in the best of the ways possible, was the almond base where the pie was sitting. That was marzipan. Seriously. The Lemon Meringue was intense, extremely smooth. Excellent dessert. It was my favorite but similarly good and surprising was the Chevre Sorbet with sweet beet, lime and granola. There was this small fried hot balls resembling to fries that I still don't understand at all. Completely unexpected. It is really fun actually. Other elements in the restaurant happened to go to a different plane considering the food. It was really not important, but for the record, the service was excellent. Friendly, attentive, knowledgeable. You name it. I don't really wanna understand because then it could probably become predictable and lost its intrinsic nature. That one to please you in all senses you can imagine. I am very fortunate to have tasted in my life several perfect dishes. Some here some there, some of them within the same meal created by just one person.

\u00a0Its a classic Chinese dipping sauce for seafood or chicken, but turns out to be a marvelous match for bossam, and is an excellent version at that. \u00a0And lest the oysters be forgotten, there are traditional versions of bossam with oysters, so feel free to tip one in before eating. \u00a0It offers an intriguing contrast to the rest of the fillings. \u00a0With the array of toppings on hand, one is encouraged to experiment, mixing and matching to vary flavors. \u00a0Much of the meal will be spent here, with round after round of wrap construction and consumption. \u00a0It will slow. \u00a0And when even the most voracious finally bow out, there will likely be shoulder left.Ssam Bar's take on bossam is remarkable, and the entire experience well-designed. \u00a0It is worthwhile for any group sharing enthusiasm for great food. \u00a0And, in my opinion, there are few better ways to bond with friends than sharing a massive hunk of meat, eating with one's hands while reaching over and under each other's arms to procure ingredients. \u00a0All this at a price that is unreal for the dining experience and quality of food.", "Date": "2013-08-18", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Michael S.", "ReviewID": "b7dAocg7jfqDWbrFOt71YA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I liked it well enough.Went for lunch on a Friday because I work in the area and I'm leaving my job so I wanted to hit up a few places before I move to my new job in another part of the city.We were a party of three and didn't have to wait to get seated at around 12:45pm.We got:* Rotisserie duck over rice set with one side (rotisserie potatoes) - $20.* Steamed pork buns - $10.* Broadbent ham that comes with a coffee mayo dipping sauce - $11.* Broccoli salad with smoked bluefish vinaigrette, crispy duck skin - $5.That order was more than enough food for 3 people and at $20 bucks each after tax and tip I wasn't sweating the bill.For me, the best thing was the rotisserie duck over rice. \u00a0I liked it wrapped with a piece of the chive pancake and some watercress leaves with some of the spicy sauces on the table. \u00a0I found the duck to be less fatty, less gamey and less greasy than what I've had in Chinatown but tasty enough for me. \u00a0I'd go back for the duck over rice set but not so sure about the rest. \u00a0I also thought the rice tasted great. \u00a0It probably was cooked with duck rotisserie fat and also had hints of herbs and spices from the fat. \u00a0I wished they had given more than one chive pancake, though.For me the most underwhelming dish was the Broadbent Ham. \u00a0I didn't want to get the ham but a person in our party \"isn't crazy about duck\" but then proceeded to eat a lot of duck and say how great it was after making me switch the order from duck buns to the ham. \u00a0The Broadbent Ham is prosciutto with a coffee mayo side. \u00a0The dipping sauce is interesting but the dish didn't really fit with the rest of the meal for me. \u00a0Maybe growing up with an Italian mother and how we served prosciutto as an antipasta before Italian meals makes me biased.The fingerling potatoes were tasty and cooked perfectly with crispy, burned parts and a soft inside. \u00a0Also some herbs in there and like everything else here probably cooked in duck rotisserie fat drippings. \u00a0They were about as good as potatoes can get.The broccoli salad was also tasty. \u00a0Served cold with bacon bit like duck skin bits and a light, fishy mayo. \u00a0Good.The pork buns were fatty, indulgent and tasty if you're into that kind of thing. \u00a0Not sure I'd get them again since I'm just not crazy about pork buns that are so fatty and also at that price. \u00a0Would try the duck buns next time which are $7.Not surprisingly, the Chinese guy in our party didn't like it. \u00a0He also didn't like Mission Chinese when we were in San Francisco. \u00a0I think he most enjoyed the prosciutto which he added sriracha sauce to, which totally weirded me out.", "Date": "2013-04-27", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Katrina T.", "ReviewID": "Cp8MCgxaoPNY6a7nvG8LFw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "3.5 stars just because of the steep steep prices in their dinner menu! This place isn't good for groups! Had to order tons of \u00a0dishes that weren't even filling. They were so delicious though. Let me give you some background on Momofuku Ssam Bar. Momofuku means lucky peach! Random right? You see the peach emblem on David Chang's (the owner/chef) restaurants like Momofuku Milk Bar, Momofuku Noodle Bar...etc .Sadly, I wasn't able to try all of his locations as much as I wanted to. This guy is pretty much clever. David got famous for his PORK BELLY BUNS. It is a simple bun (used commonly to eat with peking duck). He basically just slabbed on a piece of meat and added some special sauce and created the Pork Belly Bun. Till this day you HAVE to try this overpriced piece of deliciousness out! Chinese restaurants all over NYC have attempted to imitate this bun, but it just doesn't turn out quite so good! Anyway, you can't make reservations for this place. The wait for a table of 6 was about 30-45 minutes. Not too bad so my cousins and I went to the bar next door (owned by Momofuku too). BTW Momofuku Milk Bar was across the street but my cousins said it wasn't that great and they took us to Dessert Bar, Chickalicious. YUMS. Ok no more tangents. So the place gets packed, the seats are sorta cramped but we managed. Ordered another round of Pork Belly Steamed Buns and a bunch of other things: Shanghai Noodle: It was such a tiny little bowl! So good though. Not your typical golden yellow noodle, but more like plain looking with trout roe sprinkled on top. Spicy Honeycomb Tripe: Never really had tripe on its own dish besides in my pho or something. This was nice and squishy. It was almost like I was eating a bowl of noodles! Market Greens: Pretty vegetable colors! Roasted Lamb Lion & Belly: My FAVE dish! Came with an egg too! It was so moist and pink. It was salty and tasted like duck too for some reason... Spicy Pork Sausages & Rice Cakes: Loved the Rice Cakes. It was hard to find the sausages in all that sauce! This place is good if you were eating dinner for 2, not for 6!

This was a glistening hunk of beauty with a crackly sweet glazed skin giving way to layers of jellowy fat and juicy, tender meat underneath. How good was this pork butt? In vulgar terms, I felt like Kermit the frog playing grab-ass with Miss Piggy, pure porky perfection! The Bo Ssam dinner included bibb lettuce, rice, briny oysters, kimchi and a trio of sauces: pureed kimchi, ssam jang and ginger-scallion. A tiny squirt bottle of sriracha provided the necessary heat. I had a fun time assembling my wraps, each one was different from the other owing to the various combos of meat and sauce. The cocktails are fantastic here as well, I imbibed in several of their sake lemonades: a tart sweet concoction. Please I can has som more?! Service was unpretentious but on the ball, our water glasses were topped often and they gladly re-upped our ssam sides when they became depleted.

I'm so happy we made our way over here on Sunday evening for our last dinner in NYC. There was no wait at all (they don't take reservations unless you're having the pork butt bo ss\u00e4m with a large party), and we got a nice spot at the bar. The space is contemporary and minimalistic with dark wood walls that bear only three photos of Johnny McEnroe (apparently owner David Chang is a huge fan?). We started out with some modern cocktails. I had the Sawyer (Beefeater gin, angostura, peychaud's, orange bitters, lime juice, & simple syrup) - I LOVE anything with gin and orange bitters, so this was the perfect way to start off the evening. It was cool to see that the modern menu was a compilation of different cocktails created by artisan bartenders from NY, LA & NOLA.But it's ALL about the steamed buns here! Man-tou buns stuffed with a thick slice of pork belly that melts in your mouth, cucumbers, scallions and hoisin sauce topped with Sriracha sauce - so amazing that you can't just have one. Yes, it was so good that we ordered two plates of it, so we could both have two of the deliciousness. For our main dish, we had the whole boneless porgy with ramps and maitake mushrooms for two. The medium sized fish was grilled and extremely tasty, though we wished the chive pancakes that accompanied it were not pan fried. There was enough smokey flavor from the fish skin that eating it with a pan fried pancake was too salty. I could have been happy with stuffing them into some more man-tous. We paired the fish with some refreshing sake. Apparently there is a fried chicken dish off the menu? Or it could only be at the Noodle Bar.

Also, the pork buns here don't seem to be as good as the Noodle Bar. Perhaps they changed the recipe but the pork seemed less flavorful and more fatty, overpowered by the cucumbers even.

I'm so mad.I had such mixed feelings at the end of my meal at Momofuku Ss\u00e4m Bar. I felt so bad for insisting up and down that we had to eat there, I was sorry for wasting a meal on our short and limited trip to NY, and I felt so completely flabbergasted and confused by the so not good meal I just had I wanted to run out into the rain and scream out \"Are you f*cking KIDDING me?!!??!@#!#$%&\" to the world that had somehow completely and utterly convinced me that a David Chang restaurant was somewhere I absolutely needed to go and experience.I've been following David Chang's rise to culinary and media fame with keen interest for some time now. His accolades and recognitions are too numerous to list, and reading his interviews or watching him on the 'Food Porn' episode of \"No Reservations,\" you can't help but admire the guy with his quirky and laid back attitude about his swift rise to the top as well as what is supposed to be his \"culinary genius.\" I can deal with the annoying and weird reservation system. I get it, you want it to be accessible to everyone so you do this weird thing limiting the number of people you can make reservations for, how far ahead you can make them yada yada... And even when we got to the restaurant, the whole \"no adding people to your group once you've been seated even though you have 2 empty chairs at your table\" thing, I could forgive. It's NYC and I know the restaurant gets crazy packed so you want to ensure everyone gets served in a fair manner. The offbeat menu too, fine, whatever, that's your thing, run with it. What I don't get though, is the food really not being that great. Dish after dish, I kept cocking my head to the side, puzzled and wondering if something was wrong with my taste buds. None of it tasted good to me. Some of it just tasted weird texturally or even flavor wise. By the looks of everyone at the table, I wasn't the only one having those thoughts. My face got hotter and hotter throughout the meal, not only because of the crowd and chaos, but because I felt so bad for dragging my friends to eat there in the first place.The Beau Soleil Oysters with Kimchi Juice- yes, I know David Chang isn't making Korean food and he's utilizing the ingredients and flavors of the particular cuisine to enhance and create his own vision but really, I mean, if you're going to use Kimchi Juice with oysters, at least use fermented Kimchi juice so there's some sort of acidity to go with the dinky little oysters. What we had tasted like oysters with spicy, bitter, water. Two of our friends didn't even touch the oysters while others had to be urged to take the last few remaining on the plate. I couldn't blame them, I didn't really want them either, and I love oysters. The Cured Hamachi with Edamame and Horseradish was tasty, but no more than any other kind of Yellowtail dish you might have at a good sushi restaurant. Plus, the dish was so small, you couldn't even share it. The famous Pork Buns? So they come two to a plate. I didn't get a chance to taste them at first since we didn't have enough to go around so we ordered another one. When I put it in my mouth, I wish I hadn't. Yes, pork belly is fatty and that's what I like about it. But I had a solid square of only fat in my bun and combined with the cucumbers? Well, it was just not a good experience. I took a bite and chucked the rest onto my plate. I felt a gnawing sensation starting to grow in my stomach- it wasn't hunger, it was more like dread. The Crispy Pig's Head was fine, very porky in taste with a good crust from being deep fried and the Pear Mostarda cut through the grease well. Edward Wigwam Country Ham- it was OK, it's just ham. If anything I liked the \"Red-Eye Gravy\" that came out with it more. Sad, I know. I liked the condiment better than the actual dish. The idolized Satur Farms Fried Brussels Sprouts? It just tasted like fried Brussels sprouts with Nuoc Cham. The fried Brussels Sprouts at SPQR in SF are way better. The Long Island Crescent Duck was probably the one dish I liked enough to want to order more of. It was well cooked and very flavorful. I was sorry I only got to have one piece. Last of all the Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes. We had more than half left over of this dish and we had six people in our group. We couldn't even convince anyone to take the leftovers home. If it's a riff on the Korean street food Duhkbokki, it's a very poorly executed one. It's too spicy and greasy, and didn't have much in common with the silky, tangy, lightly spicy and sweet street food most Koreans grow up eating as a snack. The end of the meal couldn't come sooner, I just wanted to leave and forget about the whole thing. But it still bothers me, I don't know why. I think it's because I have to agree that David Chang seems so damn likable. Maybe THAT's his thing- be likable, serve weird food and everyone will think it's great because he's so cool. Genius.

To begin my experience we made reservations for 8 people for lunch. As I looked at the menu their was a variety of choices. I didn't care what was ordered so I trusted my friend to order for me since we were eating family style. For Appetizers we ordered: Kusshi Oysters (bc) - kimchi- (YUM) Steamed pork buns - hoisin, cucumbers, scallions- (Orgasmic)Blackened bluefish sandwich - miso, iceberg lettuce-(Aight) For our main course I was unprepared what was coming out, but my friends took the liberty of ordering a 10 pound Braised pork shoulder. (Korean Style) The pork shoulder is slow roasted for 6-8 hours with a brown sugar and kosher salt rub. The pork also comes from Niman Ranch. Usually this order feeds up to 6-10 people and comes along with a dozen oysters, white rice, bibb lettuce, ss\u00e4m jiang (korean bbq sauce), kimchi and ginger scallion sauce. When all of our side dishes came out with our sauces, we were ready to get our grubb on. When I grabbed the tongs to pull the pork off, I noticed the meat was so tender that it fell right off. There was no need to tug on it or use a knife. OH MY.... So the way you eat the pork is by using lettuce wraps with ginger scallion sauce, bbq sauce and kimchi. You can also opt that and just eat it with rice alone if you want. My first bite got me sprung!!! No Joke.. LOL Everyone felt the same way too. There were so much left overs enough to serve 5 others as well.

Can I also mention that we had THREE different servers?? Let me get this straight, this restaurant isn't that big, your snooty hostess/waitress can't seem to bring us some water, NO ONE ELSE is able to take our order even though it's 3pm and the lunch crowd is gone, and you still expect a tip at the end of the meal right? So after flagging someone down (this took 10 minutes) we placed our order for the infamous pork buns. I was RAVENOUS at this point and had a whole entire order (2 buns) to myself. I wish I didn't even finish the first one. I felt ripped off and not just that, I wanted to wash my face IMMEDIATELY. The grease gushed out of the pork bun, trickled down my wrist, arm, and dripped onto the table. This can be either a good or bad thing. The pork belly was extremely fatty and chewy. I wish it had some actual meat meat in there , that'd be nice. $9 for 2 of these babies? Methinks NOT. Are the buns made in house or some shit?? I bet they're frozen. Then there's the braised brisket entree. It's a rice noodle soup w/ braised brisket, Thai basil, and cilantro. First of all, my noodles were undercooked. Secondly, it just tasted like instant pho. Third, the hostess/waitress girl just plopped down a little plate of sriracha & hoisin and said \"this is for you\" No shit, really? The brisket itself was tender, but the flavor was not memorable. I took ONE bite of brisket and left it alone. I ate all the pickled bean sprouts, took 5 bites of noodles and pushed my bowl aside.That is fucking pathetic. Not only that, I can't believe I paid $19 for that big bowl that was filled less than 1/2 way. What a crock of shit David Chang is. $19 for some instant pho crap. My friend ordered the pork scrapple. Let me tell you, it took 4 mid 20's working professionals to figure out that the gray, rectangular shaped hash brown looking mushy thing underneath his eggs was the pork itself. I took one bite and had to down an entire glass of water afterward. I almost gagged. It was mushy and tasted like moldy instant stuffing from a box. You know, like Stovetop gone bad. The bacon was also soggy, and then there are eggs in the dish. There is absolutely NO texture to this dish. You might as well just be eating a bowl of congee.

Succulent with a splooge of the hoisin sauce and contrasting nicely with the cucumber slices and the shredded scallions, the pork belly was ridiculously good nestled in the pillow-like clam-shell bun (see photo). I've seen them copied here in San Francisco, in particular, on the Chairman Truck, but nothing beats the original. I just don't see how anyone can bypass them. I also went for the $7 Pulled Duck Bun - same concept, different ingredients and only slightly less satisfying. Instead of two, you get one large bun stuffed with falling-off-the-bone duck that's been smoked to the consistency of a Kansas City-style brisket.It came with Thai basil but then did an about-face with sauerkraut and smoked mayo, ingredients only Chang would think to mix together (see photo). And it works. Delicious. Jamie was ordering the $25 Prix Fixe, so he got the down-home Duck Sandwich (normally $12) for his entree. It was a classic b\u00e1nh m\u00ec but done southern style with iceberg lettuce, mayo and peppadews (sweet piquant\u00e9 peppers from South Africa) co-mingling with slices of duck breast, all stuffed in a toasted torpedo roll (see photo). Mine was the superb $14 Rotisserie Duck Over Rice with generous slices of duck marinated in Ssam sauce and basil over sticky rice. For an extra $2, I ordered the chive pancakes so I could spread the duck over several bites of goodness (see photo).Really quite amazing. As part of Jamie's prix fixe, we shared his dessert, the Corn Ice Cream Pie (normally $7), which was amazingly creamy with a blend of mango and Thai basil to finish off the not overly sweet flavor (see photo). The reason I love Chang's culinary creations is that he just goes for the jugular when it comes to the flavors he likes, so he blends his pan-Asian food with plenty of southern comfort. The results are uniquely his and well worth repeated visits to all his restaurants. Now if he would only change his mind about the West Coast, then I would be truly euphoric... and probably thirty pounds fatter.FOOD - 5 stars...still amazing food...Chang just doesn't quit, does heAMBIANCE - 4 stars...absurdly popular with crowded community table seating a challenge to the elbows at lunchtimeSERVICE - 4.5 stars...quite attentive and they move very quicklyTOTAL - 5 stars...Momofuku rules...that's all", "Date": "2012-06-11", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Amelia S.", "ReviewID": "OTQ44-2EoRVNECtoWrGr2g", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After years and years of walking by the boarded up Spring Joy Chinese restaurant and wondering why this prime corner spot was doomed to dereliction [Please choose one of the following: a) meth lab b) crazy tax shelter scheme c) under litigation d) owners forgot they owned the property], I passed by yesterday - after being out of town for most of the month - and suddenly there was a gleaming new restaurant just sitting there.

This was a surprising placement for Ssam, so I knew that I had to bump it up in my bookmarks queue once I found some willing lackeys to join me.ARRIVAL AND DRINKSDinner for three at 7pm had a 30-45 minute wait, so we opted to wait in the connecting Momofuku Milk Bar and ordered drinks. The pickle martini didn't have enough pickle brine for my personal preference. You could taste it and smell it, but I wanted it to really whollop me in my face. We also got a free lemonade cocktail because the waitress got mixed up. The lemonade is one of those dangerous drinks - you can't taste the alcohol at all! I actually suspect that they had forgotten to add the alcohol.STARTERS/RAW BARWe started off with the Santa Barbara Uni ($19), which was served with whipped tofu with a hint of lime, tapioca, and shrimp crackers. The uni was fresh and went nicely with the whipped tofu and shrimp crackers. I'm not sold that the tapioca was necessary, but the dish was a great starter. You can barely tell that the whipped tofu is tofu. Next out came the Steamed Pork Buns* ($9). Although pricy, Momofuku's classic pork buns are my favorite. The overall effect is that it's a moist bun, but it's the cucumbers that really make it. If you've never had them, order them.SEASONALOne of my favorite dishes of the night was the Fuji Apple Kimchi* ($13). It's part of their seasonal section and is served with jowl bacon and maple labne (a strained cheese yoghurt). The refreshing apple wasn't quite pickled - although I'm sure that apples can be pickled, I dunno how that might taste. Next up to bat were the fried baby artichokes ($14). They were served with a pistachio puree, sunchokes, and shaved bits of bottarga (cured fish roe). The pistachio puree was a bright bright green and I wish that there had been more because it really made the dish - as in scrape-the-bowl-with-your-finger-so-you-get-every-\u00adlast-bit good.HAMWe went with some polar opposites as far as flavors went. The hams are served with a couple slices of bread and a side of mustard for added distinctness. The Finchville's Country Ham ($11) had more of a salty flavor which was only semi-appreciated by my palette. On the otherhand, Edward's Wigwam Country Ham* ($11) was deliciously smoky and had an almost dry quality to it. Super yummy.SEAFOODThe Chili Soft Shell Crab ($21) came out with green plum slices, asparagus, lemon slivers, and a bit of ginger(?). It was just meaty enough to enjoy while not being overly filling or greasy. I was actually surprisingly pleased with this dish.MEATRight after the ham courses, we were served the Corned Beef Terrine ($15) with a fried egg sauce and tea brined egg salad. Ideally, it should have come out after a dish like the soft shell crab, but as such, I found it to be underwhelming. The salad part was excellent, but the corned beef was just meh. The last dish was served at just the right time - last. The Spicy Pork Sausage and Rice Cakes* ($18) were amazing. It was spicy (especially so for me) and very yummy. The rice cakes were crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, and better than the sausage. This dish would have really been perfect over a bowl of rice to alleviate the spicy.CONCLUSIONI was wary that things would be too salty here as they are at Momofuku Noodle Bar, but was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed nearly every dish (and out of 9 dishes, that's not bad at all). Of course, some dishes are better than others. Maybe my experience was heightened by the company of good friends - or maybe it was the alcohol, but I'd still come back again. Even so, I wouldn't rank Ssam at #26 out of all of the restaurants in the world.

It was pretty smooth and the tone of sweetness definitely made it easy to drink. Dangerously too easy! For $9 there is a Miller Killer combo which consists of said shot and a High Life tall boy. For a cocktail, try the white tee fashion which has tequila, tea and bitters. It was very smooth and clean.Now if I can only make it to Ssam Bar for lunch, I'd pair the Miller Killer with their famous rotisserie duck.

I wanted a small set of nicely produced volumes that, opened up to a random page, could instantly make me happy. The very first one I bought? The Momofuku cookbook.In multiple ways, it represented why I'd fought so hard to get back to NYC in the first place. Of course I supported David Chang's quixotic ways. But more than that, the Momofuku restaurants symbolized to me the zeitgeist of modern NYC eating culture and a food-centered exuberance that could really only thrive in a place as urban as Manhattan.I somehow found myself at Momofuku Ko a few days after arriving in the city, a fun experience. But Ssam has always seemed the most Changian of all his establishments, and I was overjoyed when a lovely convive recently gave me the chance to revisit it.We were seated at the end of a communal table on those trademark stools, as uncomfortable as ever. The place pretty much defines downtown energy, all hard surfaces and loudness and barely controlled potency -- the electric Manhattan of films like Rodger Dodger.Speaking of electricity, we started with Chang's pork buns, which probably don't need another ode in their name. So I'll keep it to one sentence: there is no better way to enjoy pig fat than by having it enfolded in a pillowy mantou bun and dressed with a smear of hoisin, even if the delivery vehicle ensures that your moans of pleasure will be strung through with rivulets of pig grease coursing down your forearm.Then came a deceivingly austere sliced baguette and butter. Oh, and whipped lardo (maybe the second best way to enjoy pig fat). It was the best bread-and-spread I've paid for since Faustina's duck egg fontina, with baguette slices I could have eaten all by themselves and little dishes of gorgeously rich butter and lardo that I *also* could have eaten all by themselves. If not for my convive, I just might have.I ordered one of the appetizers simply because I saw the phrase \"sliced sirloin\" in it. It turned out to be a carpaccio with fava beans and rhubarb. At tableside, our server poured a warm broth over the starburst of dry-aged beef, prompting panic in me -- would the meat slices cook through? Shouldn't have worried: it gave the shavings a hint of a cooked edge but no more. The broth itself, laced with lemon verbena, was reminiscent of Insieme's old \"beef en brodo\" appetizer, and the buttery heat-touched sirloin melded with its silky saltiness wonderfully.Then, imperfections: the shaved bone marrow component in a bowl of chanterelles and picked quail eggs was superfluous. A main dish of spicy pork sausage was a heap of not particularly spicy meat, the sausage hearty but somehow unexciting, though the fried rice cakes mixed in provided an interesting textural component, and who can argue with crispy shallots?In any case, our other main, grilled tilefish, was magical. A slab of whitefish with a dollop of plated sauce and a small pile of vegetable matter could have easily been ripped from the tired New American playbook. But here it was a true chef's dish: each component, from the rarely used tilefish (like sea bass with a backbone) to a pea-based curry shot through with roasted peanuts to the pickled young coconut strands, worked wonderfully on its own. Their melding kicked the plate to a whole new level, worthy of any of the high-end seafood palaces uptown, yet with a refreshingly improvisational air seemingly grounded in its East Village milieu.You've already seen my rating at the top. Yet fully 1/3rd of the meal was unspectacular. Fine. If you demand perfection from your 5-star joints, then take one star off. Myself, I only -- \"only\" -- demand the feeling one gets from a great novel: that countless visits could never exhaust the full range of pleasures that it can provide.Ssam inspires that feeling in spades, alternating between delighting, surprising, and challenging. And it doesn't always deliver. But when the thought of a restaurant's inevitable eventual passing fills me with dread, plies me with the thought, \"Would I want to live in a city that could no longer support this place?\", I'd say that a top rating is warranted. Of course, it's in no danger of closing for now, and for someone new to the city that is genuinely interested in the state of NYC dining, Momofuku Ssam might still be the first place I'd send them.

\u00a0Sure, but this more than met the hype. \u00a0In fact, after dinner, we went next door to Momofuku Milk Bar and ordered some more pork buns along with dessert.Overall, we had a great meal at Momofuku. \u00a0The Bo Ssam was plentiful in amount and quite tasty and the pork buns were fantastic. \u00a0Though the loud and trendy environment poses some challenges to familes, I think that's typical of NYC. \u00a0If you want to avoid the waits at Ssam Bar, I highly recommend you check out the next door Momofuku Milk Bar where you can still order that famous pork bun and get some of their interesting soft serve desserts (milk cereal and corn flavor). \u00a0Momofuku restaurants accept credit cards, including American Express.", "Date": "2010-08-25", "Author_Location": "Palo Alto, CA"}, {"Author": "Ro N.", "ReviewID": "jdUxGIPK43iZST0xODLxdA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Since I am too tired and too lazy - I will cut this review short since my first review got erased. \u00a0(grrrr)I wasn't too into the Ssam - pork belly with razor clam. \u00a0I love razor clam and this place totally killed my love. \u00a0I couldn't even detect any traces of the clam. \u00a0I know it's in there since I put in there myself but it just wasn't flavorful enough for me.I would however only come back just to have their steam buns with pork belly and their Cracked Empress Jonah Crab Claws with yuzu mayo. \u00a0But then again who can really mess up boiled crab claws?Overrated but 4 stars just for the two appetizers and nothing else.I would definitely not order a banh mi here - since banh mi should only cost $2 and made by true Vietnamese people and not by Korean owned place who charges $15 bucks for it.", "Date": "2008-03-05", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Michael F.", "ReviewID": "Xxo-Xfog7erzUHBxuAWlTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's really hard to give a 5/5, but Momofuku Ssam came close and I'd rather round up than down.

Bo Ssam is the only way to get a reservation, and you'll end up with off-hours times, but it's worth it.We started with the bread and butter, which was really good, but maybe not worth the price. The seasonal pickles were amazing, as were the pork buns, I wouldn't come here without ordering them again. The squid salad was similarly delicious.After the starters, they brought out the oysters for the Bo Ssam and meat accessories, and were warned not to eat the oysters while they finished up the pork shoulder. There were two bowls of rice and two bowls of bib lettuce, which they refilled as we ate. There were four sauces for the pork, Kim Chi, Kim Chi Puree, Adzuki (which was a fermented soy bean barbeque sauce), and a very mild scallion/ginger sauce. None of these sauces were very spicy, and I recommend hoarding the sriracha sauce from the pork buns if you like more heat.As we started pulling the pork apart for everyone, we began to realize that there wasn't much bone, and that we were not going to finish the shoulder. The skin was delicious, and had about an 1/8th of an inch of fat in some places. Some people really liked the oysters in the wraps (me), and some didn't think it added much (my girlfriend.) We had a five year old child with us, who was a fairly picky eater, and she filled up on the pork and the bread/butter app. We ate a truly immense amount of pork.While some of us finished up the pork, the trio of Jewish mothers who had joined the porkfest stood next to the open kitchen and watched the chefs cook, which was tolerated well.

After eating everything, I can confirm that the food is unique and well-crafted. \u00a0There's nothing like it. \u00a0It's New American w/ an asian flair. \u00a0It's Michelin doing casual! \u00a0The vibe is energetic and bustling... mirroring to the city that gave birth to it. \u00a0After saying all that, I think I came at the wrong time. \u00a0I was looking for fulfillment and comfort on that particular visit. \u00a0We were hungry, and we wanted something to stick to our ribs. \u00a0You don't really get that at a place like this. \u00a0Hence, the 3-star rating. \u00a0However, now that I've had time to reflect and understand Chang's concept...

As a lover of slow cooked pulled pork of all varieties, this had to rank among the very best and despite the stratospheric price, I still consider it a good deal, especially given our group of 5 could barely finish half of the meat along with the wraps and accompanying oysters (yes, more shellfish!) and split up the rest as leftovers which lasted days. \u00a0Sometimes one has an exceptional meal that not only defines an night, but in my case, an entire trip and Momofuku Ssam easily makes its mark in my memory for years to come.", "Date": "2011-08-17", "Author_Location": "West Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Roy C.", "ReviewID": "at4N5I3rpyY84jF2hgunIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Momofuku's Bo Ssam is a dish that all pork-lovers need to experience before death. For all non pork-lovers, the Bo Ssam may be just the dish that turns your life around, exposing to you just how incredibly delicious a pig could be. This is definitely one of the very best pork experiences I've ever had.I made my reservation a month in advance for 10pm on a Thursday night for 6 people. I was warned by many that a party of 6 was way too small to finish the 7-pound behemoth of pork shoulder, so we were well-prepared to attack this beast. I arrived with some wine in my system, hunger pains pulsating throughout my body, and a mission statement to conquer the famous Bo Ssam.We started off our meal with an order of the Momofuku pork buns. The pork belly was incredibly tender, with a small amount of hoisin sauce. Since I had the hirata pork belly buns from Ippudo the day before, I naturally made a comparison between the two. Here's the verdict: the Momofuku pork belly was much more natural and tender; the Ippudo pork belly had a much-tastier marinade. Not sure exactly which one I would say is better, but I did think Momofuku's pork belly didn't live up completely to its phenomenal hype.Now on to the Bo Ssam. When it arrived, we all said \"Whoa\" in perfect unison. The size of the pork shoulder was fear-inducing; the oily glaze whetted my appetite like I hadn't eaten in days. Cutting open the shoulder was like cutting Jell-O -- the tenderness of the pork was incredible. The skin was perfectly roasted -- oily, crispy, and packed a million flavors in one bite. The shoulder included so many different varieties of pork textures -- crispy skin, tender chunks, and flavorful shreds -- all of which were undeniably delicious.The way to eat this pork is to wrap it in fresh lettuce, with your choice of sauce (kimchi, kimchi puree, oil & chives, and gohchu jjang), some rice, and a fresh oyster. The mixture of all the Korean-infused flavors, the freshness of the oyster, and the juicy goodness of the pork shoulder is the prime example of what Asian Fusion should be. Absolutely perfect.After many personalized Bo Ssam wraps and enough pork fat to clog multiple arteries, we surrendered, but with the pride that there were only a few pieces of pork shoulder left. I think 6 people was too few, but only slightly -- and I think 9-10 people would have been way too many people. The perfect number of eaters for this Bo Ssam is probably around 7 or 8. The whole dinner for the 6 of us (for the Bo Ssam, pork buns, and 2 bottles of red wine) was $60/pp after tax & tip. Really -- it was a steal.I didn't try anything else on the menu (other than the pork buns), so I can't speak to any of their normal dishes. But I can say this with complete certainty: the Bo Ssam is one of the best food experiences I've ever had in my life -- and one of the best communal experiences, guaranteeing great memories with a group of your favorite people or new friends. When I'm old and gray, I imagine that when I look back on my lifetime of food, Momofuku's Bo Ssam will surely be one of the defining moments of that montage.", "Date": "2010-03-07", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Lisa Q.", "ReviewID": "b-E6Evn0bw8ocbjOmPE10Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm paying wayyyy too much not to have lumbar support.

My visit to Momofuku Ssam last night reminded me how much I love coming here with Brian M. Obviously nothing beats Momofuku Ko (perhaps one of the best meals I've ever eaten), but Ssam is a force to be reckoned with. \u00a010 Reasons Why to Eat at Ssam:1. Pork BunsWTF. I can't even begin to describe how delicious that piece of fatty pork belly nestled between a delicate soft white bun is. Basically, it is damn good and I'm going to hell for eating so many of them. 2. Drinks I just had a Mango Chile cocktail last night that was a snack straight from my childhood. Unripened, sour mango slices with salt and chilii/sriracha. This is just one of the many great drinks the bartender makes here. Think drinks on par with any top mixology bar in NYC. 3. Bo SsamHoly mother of all that is good - I have yet to try this dinner, however, \u00a0I can't help but stare begrudgingly at the groups that gather together for the big pork butt meal. Yes, that is me staring you down at your table while you're trying to OD on pork. 4. Portion SizesThis might be silly, but I am a huge believer that one should NOT stuff themselves when at a good restaurant. Too much of a good thing always has me leaving a little less satisfied. Just enough of a good thing makes me want more more more! Ssam gets it just right. I always leave content and thinking about when the next time I'll be dropping in.5. The StaffThere's no uniform here and I dig that. Each staff member gets to wear whatever they want, reflecting their own personality. Exhibit A: The bartender wearing a t-shirt that said \"ASSMAN\" on it. This is not your typical stuffy restaurant. But not to worry, just because the uniform is lax doesn't mean the employees are incompetent (ahem, Freemans). They are quite the opposite actually - although I'm sure David Chang wouldn't have it any other way. 6. Fried Mackerel SandwichUmmm I just had this last night and I am seriously thinking about going back right now to have more. Next time I will not be sharing this with Brian M.! Light and deliciously fried mackerel daintily placed on bread and butter toasted to perfection. 7. Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice CakesThe bf is seriously addicted to this. Nine times out of ten he will order this whenever we're here. But then again, how can one not? Chewy, crispy rice cakes swimming in a spicy sausage pool. Yep, I don't blame him either.8. BrunchLiving in NYC makes brunch super stressful sometimes. There are days when I just don't want to wait around for over an hour for pancakes or eggs benedict. If you want an exotic and yummy weekend brunch spot WITHOUT a wait, Ssam is the place! 9. Pork Buns (Again)Seriously, who only gets one order of pork buns when they're here? 10.

My Korean friend said that almost all of the entrees taste like his \"childhood in a bowl.\" \u00a0I love this term and actually, my entree of spiced pork sausage and rice cake almost tasted like MY childhood on Staten Italy - who knew?? \u00a0The sauce in the dish was red chile based but it reminded me of tomato and the rice cakes were really little doughy nuggets, slightly fried on the outside. \u00a0The thickness and texture of the rice cakes were reminiscent of Italian gnocchi and together with the ground spicy sausage, the dish tasted like a gnocchi bolognese - with some Chinese broccoli. \u00a0It was definitely good and I was craving it again today. \u00a0I think that's always a good sign. \u00a0Almost everyone else at the table got the pork shoulder with a buttermilk ranch sauce. \u00a0I tried it and it was awesome... it basically tasted like tender steak, which I didn't think was possible for pork. \u00a0The rich sauce was like a bernaise or something and it complimented the meat perfectly. \u00a0Everyone finished everything. I didn't think the prices were SOO expensive (again, I went to Ko and spent excessive amounts of money there this week too so what the hell do I know). \u00a0Definitely worth it so you can get beef up your David Chang chops.", "Date": "2009-05-21", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Wing L.", "ReviewID": "Tjon8W6N2yrLJsu0M88SfQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Momofuku, generally a name associated with Ramen.

Pork Belly Buns (similar to Peking Duck buns but with Pork belly) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- A soft fluffy steamed bun wrapped around two huge pieces of mouth-watering, juicy, tendor pork belly. I loved how they didn't smother the bun with too much sauce and left the pork belly's true flavors ooze out... mmmmMMMm . I thought the pork belly buns here were way better than Ippudo's in that Momofuku left the pork belly's natural flavors be the star. \u00a02. Apple Kim Chi \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- So ingenious! I thought it would be kim chi with apples with it..but it was kim chi'ed apples! So light and refreshing. It was perfect with the creamy maple syrup-labne and salty bacon. Never would have imagined this combination of ingredients or flavors, but I'm glad David Chang did. This dish blew my mind. 3. Pork and Sausage Rice Cakes \u00a0 \u00a0 - Most heavy and flavorful dish, which makes sense since it was the main course. We shared and the portion size was just perfect for two people. Compared to the first two dishes that had very subtle flavors, this dish was a blast of spiciness and saltiness. Not to say that this wasn't good, it just wasn't as good as the first two. However, I liked how the rice cake was cut into small pieces (unlike traditional Korean places) and the modern twist on this dish with the veggies and minced sausage.Overall, Momofuku Bo Ssam was amazing. I would definitely come back again. The boyfriend and I shared three dishes and it was perfect portion size for Lunch. Total billed came to around $50, which for NY, I think is pretty normal (thank goodness I don't live here long term, else I'll go flat broke). \u00a0My only gripe is that the service was pretty .. snooty.

Now, what is interesting (light bulb), how these questions are related to the expectations of a restaurant and the food. Style, content and detail are \"the stuff\" of great dining. Credit card in hand, I walk into Momofuku Ssam for my first culinary treat.I had the white ale: very good beer (I wanted to get the beer thing out of the way first). With it, I had the hanger steak. A marinated cut not so well known but usually very tender and referred to in the trade as \"butcher's tenderloin\". Now for the faint at heart, you may not want to read on; the hanger steak gets its name from how it is butchered. When the bovine animal (cow, ox or buffalo) is hung and split, the \"hanger steak\" falls out. Strange but true fact, doesn't communicate anything about Momofuku Ssam but interesting to a \"foodie\". So my steak was tender, accompanied by caramelized onions, green onion and kimche sauces, bibb lettuce and a bowl of sticky rice. Was I expecting more from this dish? Yes. Was it overpriced and some what unexciting? Yes. I watched other tables and every one was eating and drinking and enjoying the food. What does all of that say for you?Momofuku Ssam is an average value for your dollar. I was expecting more from the food but it all tasted and looked very fresh and \"it is what it is\".

Tender and juicy and different. The Thai Iced Tea Parfait--was smaller and presented differently than I thought it was going to be (when I think of a \"parfait\", I think of a tall glass, but maybe that's just me and my lack of imagination).

I ordered the grapefruit pie. At first, I wasn't too in love with it - I think it's because grapefruit is naturally sour to begin with. But it started to grow on me, and I really love pie crusts.

We have some excuses, but they're not even worth mentioning because we know they are nothing but excuses. We are ashamed, but we wouldn't trade the loss for anything else! Bo Ssam, you were incredible. I was disappointed when I found out that the \"pork butt\" was in fact not a butt, but a pork shoulder. But, my disappointment was quickly a thing of the past when I put the first bite, sans sauces as the expert server recommended, into my mouth. I chewed, but not much because the juicy, tender meat just dissolved in my mouth. The entire bo ssam meal is a fun, interactive experience where you get to build your own lettuce wrap with rice, your choice of sauce, the raw oyster (mmhhmmm yum), and of course the star of the show, pork butt. The sauces are very complementary - kim chee puree, ginger scallion sauce, chili soy bean paste, kim chee, salt - and they bring out a different tasty experience with each wrap you make. How many combinations? Well, pascal's triangle tells us we can make 32 different combinations, including the none option. I wouldn't recommend trying them all, nor do I recommend eating 32 wraps, but definitely use your palate and create your own. My favorite (if I had to decide right now) is the kim chee puree and ginger scallion combo. The Bo Ssam seating is a great idea for birthday celebrations (which we were having), and big group treats. It is the only way you can get a reservation at Momofuku Ssam Bar, so that in itself is a sweet deal. You do have to make the seating in the early evening (ours was at 5:45p) or late night. And, IMHO the price of the bo ssam is really fair for the amount of food you get and the number of people you can feed. For those who think Ssam Bar is overrated, I can understand the sentiment. But the Bo Ssam really is worth it and is really that good, so for that alone Ssam Bar has deserved my props.PS.

Like instead of just steaming the pork belly, they might have been seared or roasted before plating. Its like their pork buns went through an evolution. The BBQ bun looked like it could be really fatty but its composition was more meaty than fatty. You may want to try adding some hot sauce to this because it mixes well the slaw in the sandwich.The Swiss chard is a much improved version of greens with oyster sauce you find in run of the mill Chinese places. The portion is large enough for 2-3 people and there's a slow, simmering heat from the Thai chilies in this dish that sneaks up on you in a good way. Its garnished with fried onion and if you dig around on the bottom of the bowl you'll find bits of dried scallop.

The tofu was a like a soft serve crossed with a meringue, covering a bed of blue berry like tapioca, leaving the uni a little overshadowed. Try it once for the carnival atmosphere. Hanger steak with romesco sauce, cauliflower and macarona almonds, they claimed the steak would be medium rare but it was closer to rare, thank you very much!

You don't understand the hype that I generated for myself so shockingly I am surprised that the pork buns lived up to my expectations. The 2 pork buns were fatty and rich balanced with the hoisin, cucumber and scallions. The buns were fluffy and freshly steamed....OMG, I could eat these for lunch everyday. We even ordered the special pork bun of the day - crispy pork belly, avocado and ginger mayo (1 for $6). This one was definitely more mellow than the regular one on the menu but just as delicious.The duck confit with duck liver mousse with escarole and a sunny side up egg served on a toast. Anything with egg yolk oozing over another protein is absolutely heaven for me. this dish definitely reminded me of a sausage and egg breakfast but with fancier ingredients! Great robust flavours. The richness was definitely balanced with the escarole and beet salad. The Seville orange semifreddo with grand marnier soda caramel was light and refreshing.

Tripe isn't for everyone but this dish, if no one told you it was tripe, you'd probably devour with ease. It was a big bowl of tripe but the flavours were so fresh and light that it was easy to finish. I love how tender the tripe was - not an easy feat.The veal sweetbreads with almond sauerkraut and thai chilli was my least favourite dish of the day. The sauce was tangy and nice but I found that the fried sweetbreads were too heavy and it had a powdery taste.The quark ice cream malt chocolate beet had interesting flavours. I've never had beets in my dessert before so it was neat to try. The dessert was interesting but not something I'd order again. Overall, very interesting dishes and flavours.

They differ from some other fusion restaurants I've been to in the sense that they work with non-commonplace ingredients.

The two dishes we ordered that are usual suspects on the menu were the spicy ricesticks and pork buns. The ricesticks were crisp on the outside but \u00a0still chewy, and they were covered in yummy spicy sauce. Pork buns were probably the best I've ever had (comparable to Ippudo's). The pork is so tender that it melts in your mouth and is the perfect complement to the sweet buns. Not a cheap place, people come here for the fine-dining experience, not to fill their stomachs.

I've had to pork buns a number of times, so we skipped them (but they are everything people say they are - yum). We tried the oysters first, which were fine, but nothing special. Next we had the apple kimchi which I *really* enjoyed. I thought the flavors worked, as well as the contrast of the crisp apples and crunchy bacon. Delicious. We then tried the oxtail dumplings, which (like the oysters) were good, but nothing special. Lastly, we shared the pork sausage and rice cakes. This dish was awesome!

The meat comes out still a little pink, mouthwateringly succulent, and the skin crispy and delicious on the outside! It's a little fatty, but that's the nature of duck. The dish comes with an assortment of greens and scallion pancakes and lettuce leaf wraps and rice, and several sauces to go with! It's duckin' amazing.I would come here every other week if it wouldn't break my bank account by Xmas. That said, it's actually not too expensive if you bring enough people to split; something like $140 (not including tax). Service is also very friendly, and make sure to make your reservation way in advance.

Let me preface this by saying that this place used to be my favorite go-to restaurant in all of New York. I always knew I'd get to try something different and that it'd be good. I don't have that same confidence anymore. First of all, they introduced a cocktails area at the entrance-side of the long bar. All night long there was this overachiever bartender shaking his drinks as if his life depended on it. Literally, with all the force in his sad little body. I wanted to kill myself about 5 mins into the meal. You do NOT want to sit anywhere near him. The restaurant is loud enough as it is. On top of trying to push the overpriced cocktails, which are detailed, along with a wine list in a crappily designed Moleskin journal. They literally just cut out the printed sheets and glued them into the Moleskin randomly. Really? Poor effort. There was a bottle of Chateau Mussar which I've gotten at Terroir just about 2 blocks away - priced at $140. The same bottle (same vintage) at Terroir is just $100. That's freaking ridiculous. I always liked that Momofuku Ssam Bar didn't push booze but that seems to be their new agenda. It makes me sad because I think that they used to focus on food only and now they're trying to cash in with booze and it shows. The food was really disappointing. Sure, the pork buns are good. However, ALL of the other dishes we ordered that night were just ehhh. One of the dishes was so salty, I literally drank about 4 glasses of water with it - I forget what it was but it was the XO sauce that did it. Last time I checked, XO sauce is supposed to be salty but it's not supposed to give you high blood pressure from a half teaspoon of the stuff. I was so shocked and really more bummed than anything. What happened to the old Ssam Bar? The service was crappy too. They had this I-don't-care-what-you-think attitude because Momofuku has such a good reputation. It's almost like, hey, if you don't like it, someone else does! R.I.P. to the old, way way way better Momofuku Ssam Bar. I'm sorry you guys got greedy and are now making food that simply isn't as good. It makes me really sad.

Ariel K. seems to think it was because she name-dropped, but I don't even think the hostess heard her. So, great start.I started with a Bulleit 90 on the rocks, which was 13 dollars.

What we wanted was the sort of playful exuberance Chang has, at the very least in his public persona, cultivated; what we wanted was out-and-out deliciousness. What we got was what were were definitely not expecting: nuance.There it was in an opener of uni, laid in a soup of tiger's milk and nori, with bits of fennel: subtle, enveloping, a sustained note of brine giving way to a late punch of citrus and heat. If you've had Avenues's crab-roe-calamansi construction, this is a logical complement. Best dish of the night.And again in a set of kimchi-rubbed honeycrisp apple matchsticks, the mountain topped with guanciale and cilantro and set against a smear of maple aioli. Again, a well thought-out progression: the crisp notes of the apple, the herbal notes of the cilanto and kimchi, the smoke and fat of the bacon and the mayo. A surprisingly orchestrated vision; a perfectly pleasant bite. Polite, even.Even the buns were tame: the pork belly was not particularly fatty, the hoisin was minimal, and the cucumbers faint (though excellent). My standard-bearer here are the pork belly sammies at the late KS Seafood (RIP) in Chicago, and I must confess Chang isn't even close--the pork needs more fat, and he needs something like the ground peanuts that KS provided to enhance the richness of the meat and sauce.We finished polite, too: the fried brussel sprouts were a two-chord riff(Eb5 and Bb5, I figure) of crunch (the addition of Indian-style fried rice puffs was clever though superfluous) and tart (fish sauce vinaigrette and mint); the pig's head croquettes were a gentle expression of gelatinous flavor, with a pear mostarda that was shockingly--wait for it--elegant. Neither was a flavor bomb; both were surprisingly quiet, as was our enjoyment of them.Refined cooking. Here. We were--well, we were stumped.

He said he was the bartender (we were not at the bar) but he can help us. So we finally ordered from him. The food was good. Not amazing, but good! Maybe by the time we were eating, the indifferent service had affected our salivary glands. I'm not sure. I would have to say that the BBQ bun is considerably better than the Pork Belly Steam Buns available at the bar. Next time (if there is a next time, which there won't be), I'd skip the Shiitake Buns which I found to be salty and not really very good. We tried a couple of things from the Seasonal menu: one more successful than the other. The good: Apple Kimchi with Pork Jowl. The tang and spiciness of the apple kimchi contrasted very well with the saltiness of the pork jowl. The bad: Crispy Pork Shank. All this really is is a spring roll. And you really only get one, cut in half to make it look more substantial. But for the pleasure of eating this, you get to pay $13. Then it was time for the busboy to clear our plates. The busboy cleared our plates but motioned for us to keep our cutlery. I asked to get clean cutlery, but he just keeps motioning me to take my knife and fork. It was basically a Mexican Stand-off. The guy clearly doesn't speak a word of English, so I just backed down and hung on to my silverware. I'd have to say that our main course was divine. Lamb Loin and Belly roasted to perfection with crispy bulgur and a beautiful egg yolk cooked to a silky custard consistency.

That behemoth kicked our butts with about 1.5 pounds left to spare. The pork shoulder was so tender, fell right off the bone. Everyone at the table was surprised at how easily the tongs tugged away at the meat. Not sure what they rubbed it with but it was tangy, sweet, with a little kick.

So for his birthday, I decided to give him a night to remember (filthy thoughts aside). So I got to work assembling a small army of few carefully selected close friends (that could eat) and we whisked him off to a meal created by meat lovers for meat lovers. Amongst our party of 8, we had Momofuku veterans (who have collected under their belts, all the brands offered by the David Chang dynasty), the experienced and then there are ones like me, total Fuku virgins.The famed Bo Ssam is quite the bold foray into this dining phenomenon. Think the biggest, juiciest, brownest, most tender slab of pork shoulder you've ever seen with a sweet aroma that sings to you before it even reaches the table and that doesn't even come close to what the Bo Ssam is. Even with the most gentle wave of the magic tongs, the meat almost falls apart instantaneously to reveal layers upon layers of juicy, melt in your mouth meat. Even with a party of 8, half of which consisted of hungry, properly sized manly men we could not finish the pork butt (partially because the other half consisted of slender, figure fit, demure women) (yeah right). It probably didn't help that we gorged ourselves on other mind bending starters.I was almost tired of hearing about the Momofuku pork buns and how heavenly they were. I have to say, though good it doesn't warrant the kind of legendary following it gets. In my opinion, Ippudo does a much better, heartier, more savory version. Momofuku's almost tastes a bit bland, in comparison. I almost always remember a place that serves good bread and butter. And if you're going to charge for what they usually give complimentary at other places, it better be some damn good bread and accompanying butter. This place delivered. The bread was hot to touch. The sea salt butter was rich, creamy and salty (in a good way). Sparks flew when butter met bread. The whipped lardo may be for some people, but not for moi. They gave us extra hot bread to finish off the remaining butter, how can you not tip for that?The other dish we were all dying to try was the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes. What a beautiful anomaly this was. First of all, the flavors are very reminiscent of Sichuan Ma Pao Tofu, but the herbs hail heavily from Southeast Asian cooking, the spicy pork sausage tastes a la Italiano and the crispy, crunchy yet chewy rice cakes are all Korean. To create such a complex dish and make it work is a crowning achievement and easily one of my favorites of the night. Now onto some of the complaints I have. At first I thought the open style kitchen was such a nice touch and quite a treat to watch how these artists make their magic. But through the night I quickly found that this was a horrible idea. The chefs seem so unmotivated, moved so slowly, had such little enthusiasm for their craft that it was bringing my mood down. I think if you are going to have an open style kitchen, you gotta be ready to put on your best face. A few of the dishes, though savory were a bit heavy handed with the salt. I wish they could have scaled back a bit on the sodium, it was overpowering at times. Overall I thought the experience lived up to my expectations and I'm glad to have done it. I think this place is a serious must try spot on the NYC culinary map. You get to try amazing dishes and well concocted foods and surprisingly pay very little for it.

The entire bo ssam meal ($200) came with a plate-sized hunk of pork shoulder, 12 raw oysters (not enough in my opinion, but what can you do?), lettuce, white rice, and Korean pastes/dipping sauces. The lettuce was my favorite part of the meal.. very fresh and fluffy. The oysters seemed fresh, as well. The pork was well-cooked: crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside, but unfortunately it was way too salty. (Please take note, Momofuku!)We also ordered two servings of steamed buns as apps, which came with a total of six pieces (very little for the price.. $22, I believe). They were tasty, but, like I just said, pricey.Afterwards, my friends raved about the meal, but I couldn't get over the saltiness of the pork shoulder. I'm not sure I would go back to Momofuku (mainly because I'm Korean, and I could make ssam at home anytime), but I would recommend trying the bo ssam at least once. (I'm kinda curious about the rotisserie duck ssam, though.) I'd just ask for one that's light on the salt.", "Date": "2012-08-03", "Author_Location": "Norwood, NJ"}, {"Author": "Mona L.", "ReviewID": "zd9LLqcupG4zDLu_3i2qCw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Meat lovers, you have come home!If there ever was a place that you can get your carnivorous appetite going, this is it. \u00a0We came here as a party of eight for my friend's birthday. \u00a0Given that it was my first time, I was pretty excited.

But you still have to take those ingredients and make great dishes. The portions just leave you with only a taste of the dish. And I felt the dishes fell short on flavor...it's as if they made a good effort but just couldn't quite pull it off.If it was just on food alone, I would probably say it's okay. But, the prices are just ridiculous for what you are getting, despite quality ingredients. And for that, you feel ripped off and unsatisfied.As an example, our waiter was totally selling the Poussin and how phenomenal it is because it's a young chicken and delicious. I'm really not a fan of ordering chicken when I eat out, but decided to give it a try. Sure enough, I should have known better. First, the portion was ridiculously small with a tiny leg an maybe a thigh? \"Okay, but it probably tastes fantastic\" I said to myself. Wrong...for a young chicken, the meat was overcooked, dry and tough. And forget about the seasoning and flavor. So to charge $26 is a joke.This wasn't just one dish either.

Josh had never experienced an elevated dining experience and I was pretty sure that he and I would both die if he continued to eat processed cheese and didn't discover the virtues of sous-vide cooking (or even arugula, for that matter).Anyway, sitting at the bar was a great experience. The bar itself was dark wood, nice and comforting to the elbows. Bartenders were gracious and efficient, dressed in either ironic t-shirts or a white butcher's shirt. I ordered a \"Reverend Palmer,\" consisting of tea-infused Elijah Craig bourbon, lemon syrup, and bitters. It was gorgeously served in a round rocks glass with a single giant cube of ice. On the very strong side and very satisfying. Josh's Dark & Stormy was so good and gingery it made me regret not ordering it.We decided to just start ordering food at random and stop when we were either 1) uncomfortably full or 2) couldn't find anything else tempting to eat. We started with the cured hamachi (silky and fatty, but not mushy), then proceeded to the soft-boiled egg (amazing what a runny yolk can accomplish on the tongue), and the steamed buns with pork belly. Oh my lord, the buns were incredible, exactly like the ones they give you in Beijing to accompany Peking duck, and the pork belly was incredibly tender and flavorful. It might have been my favorite thing we ate all night.Three small plates wouldn't satisfy us, of course, so we ordered more. Grilled baby octopus with pickled fennel and chorizo (octopus and fennel were delicious, chorizo just too smoky and weird), and finally, at Josh's behest, the corn fried chicken. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed that he didn't want to be more adventurous with the crispy pig's head, but I guess you can't dive into epicurean ventures too deeply... The chicken turned out to be wonderful, obviously, although by this time I had progressed to a glass of Gr\u00fcner Veltliner and was drifting into culinary bliss. The chicken was our closing dish, not because we were too full or because we didn't see anything else worth ordering. Far from it. We were just worried about our wallets.

My wife and I really enjoyed the dishes she prepared (and the heavenly compost cookie) and even more so loved saying Momofuku. As such we incorporated trips to Le Peche, Milk Bar and Ssam bar during our recent journey to New York turning the Big Apple into the Happy Peach.Our Ssam experience was a lunch where we were joined by a fellow Chicagoan in town for a conference. As Ssam does not take reservations we arrived a half hour before opening to void having to wait a half hour for a table. Actually by opening time only a few parties were lined up (we would inform people Bieber was in town when tourists strolling past stared inquisitively at the small group of people standing in line in the cold). Ssam bar did quickly become busy but it took a while before there was a wait (this was on a Sunday). Inside we were warmly greeted by the host. The ceiling, walls and bar are dark woods with slate floor creating a sleek vibe. Seating is on low wooden stools and there is a fairly casual vibe. \u00a0Definitely more bustling than our lunch the day before at sister venue La Peche, but not quite as friendly. The lunch menu is small, but varied with an emphasis on raw seafoods, duck and pork. Asian inspired fare with the chefs own personal influence. There is a mixture of offal and less challenging cuts of animal. In addition to a la carte there is a $25 three course prix fixe (a few options for each course) and the Ssam courses have to be ordered in advance (google it if you are unsure of what this means - as was I).I opted for the prix fixe and was happy with two of my courses. \u00a0The famous pork buns are a \"must\" - two generous chunks of moist pork belly with delicious hoisin sauce; siracha is provided to add heat to your liking. A serving is comprised of two buns. Sweet, salty, spicy, delicious My entree was a duck sandwich; the menu did not offer much of a description and I was disappointed that it turned out to be duck liver (it was a bahn mi style sandwich); I am not a fan of liver, but should have asked questions (though a better menu description Would have been helpful). My wife ordered a la carte and I was hella jealous of her dish; rotisserie duck over rice with a chive pancake and a potpourri of fixings such as shallot crisps. Awesome dish (fortunately my wife played nicely and shared). My lemon meringue pie ended the meal on a high note; I loved the pistachio crust and the pie was served cold leading to a tart like texture more so than creamy texture which was really pleasant.Ssam bar is on the smallish side and the wash closet (bathroom) - at least the one I used is awkward. First off the door is heavy and there was a line up and it turned out the first person in line had checked the doors and mistakenly thought they were locked (be sure to give it a good push when testing the door). Beyond that the door opens inwards in such a manner one side of the entry is blocked by the blower, one by the door and the front by the toilet - it is smaller than a commercial airline coach bathroom and requires a good deal of agility, gymnastics and yoga just to enter. Peculiar wash closets aside, Momofuku Ssam is an energetic venue with an interesting menu that makes it (along with the entire Momofuku empire of restaurants) worthy of a visit; in fact I would be a happy camper if they would open a Chicago Momofuku.

The wait staff was a little on the slow side but in all fairness, it was a packed Friday night service. Obviously, the pork buns were a highlight... melt in your mouth heaven. I had to have two. The seasonal pickles were really good and complimented the savoury, spicy dishes well. The apple kimchi was actually decent. Being of Korean descent, I love my kimchi so I was a bit wary of apples being done up in a similar fashion but it worked. The crunchiness of the apples with kimchi flavours reminded me gakduggi (korean radish kimchi) but with a sweet twist. The spicy pork sausage and rice cakes were super tasty, a tad on the salty side (needed to chase this dish with ample amounts of water), but tasty nonetheless. This is sort of a twist on duk-bokgi (rice cakes in a spicy Korean sauce) but the rice cakes in this dish were toasted and crispy and balanced off nicely with the spicy and meaty pork sausage. I've been dreaming about the day I can go back to NYC to indulge in the pork buns but dream no more! David Chang is bringing Momofuku (and those delectable pork buns) to Toronto in 2012! I will be waiting in line come rain, sleet, hail or snow to savour, once more, those buns.", "Date": "2011-04-05", "Author_Location": "Toronto, Canada"}, {"Author": "Steve L.", "ReviewID": "Tfxfe2MCwY4QmrlR7xpo7g", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like Momofuku Ssam Bar.

We were warned that the dishes were more like tapas/appetizers, but we were HELLA surprised with the portions vs. price. Apart from that, the quail was amazing, so tender and juicy and flavorful. Like chicken's more classy, well bred cousin. Yum yum yum, gone all too soon. I never knew what spaghetti squash was, so that was my discovery for the night.

So we arrived before 5 pm, fearing there will be a long line as they do not take reservations. Fortunately, no one wants to eat this early on a nice summer night. We and a few other people were seated quickly in the very nice, simple and modern dark wooden interior. Casual but stylish. Three of us ordered 6 oysters, Santa Barbara uni, pork buns, snap peas, and pork shoulder. The oysters were the largest I've seen, a little overwhelmed by the \"kimchi\" sauce that tasted more like salty water than the rich full of heat kimchi flavor I was expecting. Uni was good, especially paired with slightly sweet nori. I wish there were more nori bits. Snap peas had a strong flavor, also bordered on being too salty which overpowered any other taste. The minced hard boiled egg balanced out the spiciness, but overall the taste was still a bit too much to be able to enjoy the fresh snap peas. Pork buns were good. I was dreading swallowing what looked like pure fat inside the buns, but surprisingly it didn't taste greasy or gross at all. Yes, it was a yummy dish, but I am not sure if I'd make a special trip just for that. Pork shoulder came with zucchini (if I remember correctly) which were really tasty in this light creamy sauce, but the pork shoulder itself was way too tough and chewy.

Its basically the same thing as eating a huge bowl of Fettuccine Alfredo... about half way through, you find yourself completely sick of the same rich and heavy flavor.

I felt a little bit sick from all the richness of the pork. You can't eat too much of it though because after a while you've just had enough of the same repeating flavors.

There were 2 people eating when we came it. Ordered the steamed pork buns and Edwards wigwam ham to start then had the rotisserie duck over rice and a side of chive pancake along with the duck sandwich for the mains.The pork buns were good but didn't blow me away like before. Not sure if it is me or the pork buns... They were juicy and tender but not as juicy or tender as I remember from the Noodle Bar. The ham was smoky and sliced thinly like prosciutto. I could eat this all the time. The bread with the ham was perfect. Crunchy on the outside but not hard. Soft on the inside. The mustard that came with it also had mayo and coffee. Interesting mix, was good with the ham.The rotisserie duck over rice came with duck scallion, ssam sauce, and crispy shallot. I added a scallion pancake but that was probably unnecessary. The duck was cooked perfectly. It was succulent, tender, and crispy on the outside. The rice had flavor from the duck and a side of watercress added a peppery taste to the dish. The scallion pancake was ok, nothing spectacular.The duck sandwich came with iceberg lettuce, spicy mayo, and peppadews. The bread was perfect and the sandwich was very good. I would have preferred more filing on the inside but everything inside the sandwich belonged in there. There was a liver spread on the sandwich that was great.The pork buns are overpriced at $10 for 2 and the ham probably about right for $11. However the duck over rice was worth $14 but not $2 for the scallion pancake. The duck sandwich was definitely worth $12. Service was fine.

As it has been covered by so many shows, magazines, travel guides, Momofuku shops are definitely a hot spot not only for tourists, but for New Yorkers themselves. There are many Korean American chefs out here in NYC, who along with many Korean restaurants, have made tremendous efforts to trenscend Korean food into something more mainstream. But, no other restaurant has better fused the Korean element of cuisine into something so wildly popular as Chef Chang. For that, it is definitely worth the experience. And the Pork buns are as you read in million other reviews FANTASTIC. That itself is worth the whole trip and the whole hype. Really. It's so good that I just couldn't believe what I was eating. Come back after you take some shots and it tastes even better. I thought I was dreaming.But, nonetheless I can only give 3 stars because every other dish was mediocre. Although they were interesting, like the Fuji Apple Kimchi, the buns are definitely a dominant force in this dining experience. No other dishes were entertaining to match the explosive opening of the buns in this restaurant. I tried every dish and they were other too provocative, salty, and needlessly heavy in terms of ingredients. The Korean element fused into the dishes made it interesting, but that was about it. They could not elevate it into something spectacular or simply \"good\". Lastly, if you are looking to really make the best experience out of Momofuku Ssam Bar, gather some friends. I would suggest 8 is just about perfect and order the \"Ssam\". The experience can be vastly different for those of you who try this. This is a mind blowing experience. If you tried this on the first time here, you will give a 5 star rating plus and curse me for the 3 stars I gave. I gave 3 because the whole experience was not as smooth as I expected it to be. Buns and Ssam are A+, but all other dishes were mediocre; thus, the three. All in all, the hype is there for what it is.

This is the third David Chang establishment I've been to and the first I've liked. (The first two were Ko and Milk Bar.) A and I arrived at 11pm on Monday night and were seated at the long communal table. Luckily, the restaurant was only half full so though it was communal, we had our own space. I can just imagine what it'd be like on a crowded Saturday evening at prime dining hours - nightmare. A had been here before and said I was \"in for a treat.\" He'd previously come with a big group for the ssam and had loved it. We started off with some drinks; he had some kind of beer. I had the Mountainside - whiskey, fennel and orange bitters. I couldn't taste the fennel, but still enjoyable if you like whiskey. The orange was fragrant and lightened the drink. Definitely a \"strong drink,\" if you're into fruity, \"girly\" cocktails, this isn't the one for you. Inside of doing entrees, we decided to get a bunch of appetizers. We ordered two from the raw bar - striped bass and uni. The striped bass was delicious! The fish was super fish, and it's topped with sugared kumquats, Japanese rice balls and a dash of cilantro. The uni was interesting... A liked it a lot. I love, love, love fresh uni (this was) but the more I have uni in dishes, the more I'm realizing I'm a naturalist when it comes to it. Just scoop it out and put it on a plate - yum. Regardless of my personal preference on how to eat that particular ingredient, the dish itself was creative and layered with different flavors and textures. My second drink was the Alcerro's Spice - bourbon, pear and cinnamon. Again, not a \"girly\" drink; the flavors of pear and cinnamon were faint. They use the huge cubes of ice that take up half the space of the glass; I love it. We ordered a BBQ bun. For $6 for one, it is pricey but it is bigger in size than the regular pork bun, so it's good to share. A liked the pork bun better, but I thought it had great smokiness and the crunch and flavor of the coleslaw was good and complemented the meat well. We did agree that the abundance of BBQ sauce on the bun did overpower the other flavors a bit. We ordered the sweetbreads and tendons. The sweetbreads are fried, not as good as grilled IMO, it makes the gland more heavy and gland-y..? (For lack of a word to explain what I mean. In Korean, the word I would use is 'neu ggi eh.') The goat cheese spread underneath and pears did a lot of balance the heaviness and brightened the dish up considerably. The best thing of the night! Those pears! David Chang uses Korean pears and it's macerated/poached/I don't know what method in mint, but the result is phenomenal. Juicy, crisp, light, flavorful - he should just serve that with some kinda sorbet (maybe lemon) for dessert. The tendons were A's least favorite. When I read 'tendons,' I was picturing tripe for reason (dangit), so it took me a second to accept the reality of what we got (I was really looking forward to tripe!) and afterwards, I thought it was quite good (but a bit large to share with just one other person), especially if you like tendons and beets. The shining component of the dish are the chicharones - they're so good, flaky and delicate (not your average pork rinds), we asked if we could get a little more and the staff so kindly obliged. My third and final drink was the Final Ward - rye, maraschino, green chartreuse and lemon. Winner! This cocktail, I could drink again and again (I'm already planning a repeat visit - at the bar next time?), refreshing and complex in flavor. I love green chartreuse and lemon; such an amazingly good flavor combo. For our final course, we got an order of pork buns. Each order comes with 2 so no messy cutting had to occur this time. The sandwich is huge and overflowing due to two thick slices of the pork belly present. At first bite, I thought the meat was a tad dry, but as I got my third bite (all fat), I realized it was because the first two bites were just the meat parts of the belly. I recommend that you flip one of the pieces so you get equal amount of meat and fat for each bite. The only thing I didn't like was how the dishes came out as soon as they were prepared, one right after the other. Maybe it's because they're meant to be shared family-style, but to me, it just makes me feel rushed to eat fast. Especially if you were to come when it's busy and you don't have as much space as we did. We were too stuffed to try dessert, but definitely next time.

We also sampled the Edwards country ham dish, which gives you about 20 extra-thin slices of succulent ham served with some \"Redeye\" mayo which is coffee and sriracha-infused mayo. The country ham dishes are perfect for munching on between bites of the more substantial entree-type dishes. I'm not sure how anyone not in the industry would be able to make an informed decision about which of the four ham dishes to pick, so that was a little discouraging.

Thankfully, the wait wasn't too long and the ony regret I have is that I was unable to order the Bo Ssam which is what they are known for. (That will cost you $200 and its for about 6 people). Instead, we got a bunch of dishes to really see what David Chang and company can give us and it was nothing short of Amazing. Let's begin:We started off at the bar and ordered a drink. They have some pretty interesting drinks. I have chosen the Mountainside - japanese whisky, Fennel, orange bitters. Very amazing and smooth, some of best whisky drinks i have had (but I'm not a whisky drinker). Then we went to the meals, I started off with the famous pork buns. These are an absolute most, some of the best pork buns I have ever tasted. It melted in my mouth. I could of a dozen of these alone. Then we moved to the cured ham, it was nice and suddle which was good for our palette. We proceed to trying the fuji apple kimchi and this was a HOMERUN!!! Considering that I am korean and it is a bit change to order kimchi as an order, it turned out better than i have expected. The pear really complements the food. Then we orded the boneless porgy and it was phenomenal, the fish was perfect and that broth was amazing!!!. Because we couldn't have the Bo Ssam, we still wanted to see momofuku attempt at pork. So orderd this pork dish that was cooked to perfection. Then the final piece and this is very interesting because its fusion between chinese food and korean dish called Duk Pok Gee. Cylindrial Rice Cakes glazed over pork and other chinese sauses. It was very good and the rice cake was cooked in an interesting way where in the INSIDE (not out side) was a touch over cooked. It was genius because it changed the complexion of the dish I have eaten for the past 20 years.Overall Momofuku was great. No it was amazing. People who don't go out to good restaurants even applauded me for the choice when they were making fun of the name for the past 2 days, but they shut up really fast when this shit hits mouth.

I hadn't heard anyone rave about the ham dishes so let me be the first. I loved it, possibly the best thing I had...well ok the pork buns...but still just flat out delicious.

It came with 12 raw oysters, rice, 4 different sauces (2 types of kimchee, scallion oil and a spicy paste), and lettuce to wrap everything up. We were all a little suspicious of the pork & raw oyster combo but it was a perfect marriage. The pork is roasted with brown sugar so the ocean saltiness of the oysters brought everything together in this wonderful, savory way that I don't even have the words to explain exactly how fantastic it was.

I go out to eat a lot in and around NYC and I was genuinely disappointed in this place considering it had such great reviews on Yelp. Let me start with saying the staff were great--extremely friendly, helpful, and accommodating as well as quick service. The atmosphere was fine. It was the food. We started with the BBQ and pork buns--pricey but sooo delicious and worth it. Thank god we did because the entrees were not good and very small servings. I would have been starving had it not been for the buns!We ordered the tilefish (strongly recommended by our waiter) which I flat out did not like. It was a white fish in a curry sauce. The fish was fine I guess but totally bland--not a great texture or flavor. An extremely small serving. It came in a \"curry broth\" which tasted like it had been watered down with 2 parts water to 1 part sauce. And surprise--it was all filled with rice cakes to bulk up the extremely small serving. I'm totally fine with small servings if the food is really great--but this was not. And if I'm not mistaken it was about $25. Like I was offended.Then we ordered the spicy sausage entree. It sounded delicious. FYI Yelpers--this is not a sausage dish but rather a rice cake dish. It is literally a ton of fried rice cakes with a \"sausage sauce\" I guess but I literally could not taste the sausage, so it felt like I was eating spicy fried rice cakes with a few long beans and peppers. This serving size was okay, but I am equally insulted by having to pay $23 (I believe) for a bowl of glorified rice cakes.Also, I am part Korean and know its food. Sorry but there is close to nothing about the menu that is Korean at all--it's more like some wannabe Asian fusion mixed with American.My conclusion? Food was not good and was very overpriced.

Then someone will bring out your food for you.Here's the lunch food rundown...Rotisserie Duck over Rice- Easily the best dish for lunch in my opinion. I thought I would be disappointed because I am usually biased towards Chinatown's roast duck...but I think this is what David Chang does best: Making homestyle comfort food with the best of the best ingredients. The duck was perfectly cooked with a nice pick interior and just the right amount of fat, and the natural flavor of the duck was unbelievable. While way more expensive than Chinatown, it was also way tastier and juicier. Under the slices of duck were the scraps of the duck, which were tasty, succulent, and delicious as well. The rice was tasty atoo as it sucked up the duck fat. Also, the scallion pancakes (a $2 add-on) was well worth it: Crispy exterior, slightly soft inside, and not greasy at all).Duck Dumpling Soup- Eh, not worth ordering again. The dumplings were cooked well so that the skin was still chewy, but the filling just wasn't so good...It had a bit of the duck flavor, but I was better off with the duck over rice.Fried Duck Dumplings- These dumplings were pretty much the same as the dumplings in the soup, just deep fried (perfectly I might add). However, again the filling was a bit lacking. I wish for both types of dumplings, the filling used whole chunks or strands of duck rather than a mixture.The Condiments- This definitely deserved a bit of space in my review. There were three condiments on each table, a duck scallion sauce, fried shallots, and the Saam sauce. The Saam sauce was ok, but the duck scallion sauce was really really good as it had the tastiness of both the duck meat and scallions. And as I'm a sucker for shallots and a sucker for anything fried, the fried shallots were amazing as well. They're fancy, not as greasy, tastier versions of fried onion strings. I could eat a jar of these by itself.Dinner:Dinner at Saam Bar was just ok...It's insanely popular and gets really crowded for dinner service.Here's the dinner food rundown:Pork Buns- Delicious as usual.Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes- A pretty good dish, the rice cakes were firm and chewy and the sausage gave the carb-centric dish a good kick of protein. It was just too spicy for me, but maybe I'm just weak.Bo Saam- The main attraction here...A huge pork shoulder served with some raw oysters, lettuce, sauces, and some other extras. Honestly, I was a bit disappointed. The outside meat had a nice crust to it and was sweet with a bit of either sugar-crusting or caramelization. However, the inside was kinda tasteless and dry...It's a huge portion, but not of the best stuff.To sum, dinner was maybe 3 stars, and lunch was close to 5 stars, so Momofuku garners 4. Stick with lunch service: It's less crowded with better food. And get the rotisserie duck.

Momofuku Ssam's bo ssam is definitely a must-try culinary experience and the namesake of this Momofuku. For those who don't know, ssam is Korean for wrap, and Momofuku's bo ssam is a drool-worthy feast. It includes a whole slow roasted pork shoulder*, one dozen raw oysters, and endless bibb lettuce, white rice, and sauces to make the ssam. yelp.com/biz_photos/1Ed-\u2026 Our 7lb pork shoulder was meat heaven. yelp.com/biz_photos/1Ed-\u2026 It's slow roasted bone-in with a brown sugar and kosher salt rub for 8 hours so the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender with hefty portions of pillowy succulent flesh, rich luscious fat, and crisp sweet pork skin that melted on the tongue. The oysters were great on their own and even better wrapped up in a porky ssam. yelp.com/biz_photos/1Ed-\u2026 Momofuku serves four sauces with their bo ssam: kimchi two ways (regular and pur\u00e9ed), ginger scallion sauce, and ssam sauce (essentially bean paste mixed with gochujang). yelp.com/biz_photos/1Ed-\u2026 Try different combinations to find your perfect bite.The bo ssam needs to be reserved in advance, which is not surprising considering how time intensive the prep for it is. Also, it's $200 not including additional food and drink, tax, and tip which may sound pricy but our bo ssam meal allowed my entire dining party (nine total) to stuff ourselves silly and then for three of us to take home doggy bags (or piggy bags?) with a meal's worth of food. Our server mistakenly suggested that we also order other dishes because the bo ssam might not be enough. We went a little overboard by having a full course of duck dishes (pulled duck buns, duck wings, and rotisserie duck) before our bo ssam course. Was it too much food? Yes. Do I regret it? Hell no. You know the duck is going to be good when the menu is divided into just a few sections and \"duck\" is one of them. The pulled duck buns (with corn, pickled ramp, and jalapeno) yelp.com/biz_photos/1Ed-\u2026 rivaled Momofuku's famous pork buns and the rotisserie duck (with duck scallion, ssam sauce, and crispy shallot) yelp.com/biz_photos/1Ed-\u2026 made for a delectable bite wrapped up in a chive pancake. The one dud of our meal, the duck wings yelp.com/biz_photos/1Ed-\u2026 were nothing special. Considering how much we ordered, ate, and drank I was surprised that our bill came out to less than $50 per person including tax and tip. Not bad for an afternoon of uninhibited gorging. Pork lovers who haven't had Momofuku's bo ssam yet: what the pork are you waiting for?---------------*The menu lists the bo ssam as pork butt but our server repeatedly called it pork shoulder which I found confusing. Our giant hunk of pork was served bone in and when the bone was extracted it was clearly a shoulder blade bone. So why is it listed as pork butt on the menu? You may already know the answer to this, but I didn't so I looked it up as soon as I got home and found that what we had was indeed both pork shoulder and pork butt. Despite the name, pork butt does not come from the rear end of the pig. It is one of the two cuts of pork shoulder. The pork butt is the upper portion of the shoulder and includes the shoulder blade bone, while the pork picnic is the lower portion and includes a part of the foreleg. musiccityfoodie.com/wp-c\u2026", "Date": "2012-09-04", "Author_Location": "Astoria, NY"}, {"Author": "G Y.", "ReviewID": "8OrCuQ47JP4OQFemLLktEA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love love love the Pork Buns!!! \u00a0So moist and yummy!!! \u00a0The only thing I did not like is that we had to wait till everyone was there to be seated. \u00a0 I feel it should not have mattered if we ordered for 5 even though there was 4 of us. \u00a0Go figure!", "Date": "2013-07-19", "Author_Location": "Plainview, NY"}, {"Author": "Wendy C.", "ReviewID": "DfabTH6GptJtWFNnuIcFvg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The one thing you must must get here are the pork buns. \u00a0All the hype, buzz, is true. \u00a0If you think you've already found the most amazing pork buns (like i did with dip's buns in alhambra, CA) think again. \u00a0These pork buns will knock your socks off. \u00a0So tender, so melt in your mouth, so decadent.

It was also very beautiful as you can see in my video review. It was the first time I tried raw oysters, the royal miyagi oysters.

So I was glad that a friend suggested we meet for dinner at Momofuku Ssam on Saturday night. Finally I could see what all my NYC friends and Anthony Bourdain were always going on and on about! Because they don't take reservations we made every effort for our group to meet early-ish so that we wouldn't have to wait long for a table. Little did we know that every person in the party had to be present before they would seat us, which was kind of a pain. We got seated in about half an hour or so and ended up at a shared table that was a bit of a squeeze. But I soon realized that this place is so acclaimed and so damn good that they really don't have to make any effort to make the dining experience comfortable. Here I was, squished into the wall sitting on some sort of wood stump stool next to a bunch of strangers and I couldn't be more excited. Some of the food exceeded my highest expectations while some of it I found to be disappointing in the way I find lots of fancy Asian fusion food to be. The highs included the raw Arctic char with crispy garlic pieces on top... the fish had the most incredible texture and flavor! I was also told I absolutely had to get the rice cake and spicy pork sausage, so I obeyed and did not regret it. The dish is a take on that late night Korean dish that goes so well with beer or soju, but the rice cakes are slightly crispy on the outside and nicely bite-sized. Watch out for the red peppers scattered throughout as they are VERY spicy! The dishes I found least exciting were the apple kimchi, which just tasted like apple slices with hot sauce on them (I know, what did I expect, but I guess I did expect something more) and the pickled vegetables dish, which was interesting, but I guess I'm used to more flavor in authentic Asian pickled side dishes. They also had a bread and butter dish with sea salt butter and lardo, which I thought was delicious because of the fresh, warm baguette, but not much to write home about in terms of the spreads. The pork buns were delicious, as I mentioned in my Milk Bar review, but the flavors aren't ones you haven't tried before. Overall, I wasn't disappointed in the least with Momofuku...

\u00a0We arrived a few minutes in front of 11:30 on a Saturday to get there when the doors open for lunch. \u00a0A line had already queued up in front of the entrance. \u00a0The door opened promptly at 11:30 and we were seated at the end of the long bar that almost runs the length of the restaurant which gave us a good view of the clean, open, and seemingly calm kitchen.Since the food is meant shared as a family-style dining experience, we started off by ordering four dishes. \u00a0We had a half dozen Royal Miyagi Oysters. \u00a0The Pacific oysters from British Columbia were briny and tasted of the sea and topped with restraint with lady apple, lime, chili which offered an awesome flavor contrast. \u00a0You can't go to Momofuku and not have the signature Steamed Pork Buns; therefore, we had the Steamed Pork Buns which were fluffy dough pillows folded around flavorful slabs of pork belly and topped with hoisin sauce, cucumbers, and scallions. \u00a0So simple, yet so delicious! \u00a0Next was our Fuji Apple Kimchi, which was exactly like it sounds, napa cabbage kimchi and fuji apples served over maple labne (a Middle Eastern yogurt) and topped with bacon and arugula. \u00a0The mildly sweet yogurt cooled the palate and contrasted amazingly with the spicy and sour kimchi. \u00a0While we were waiting for our fourth dish, the Fried Duck Dumplings to arrive, we decided to get an order of the Duck Noodle Soup which, interestingly, arrived before our dumplings. \u00a0Boy, am I glad we got the soup as well! \u00a0It was perfect! \u00a0It reminded me less of a Japanese style noodle dish even though it had a perfectly salted miso base and more of pho with it's use of thinly-sliced rare meat (duck breast) and thai basil. \u00a0The soup was hearty, yet not heavy. \u00a0Between the Steamed Pork Buns and the Duck Noodle Soup, I don't know which one I loved more! \u00a0Lastly, our Fried Duck Dumplings arrived, perfectly fried and flavorful, served along pickled red cabbage with a sriracha mayo dipping sauce. \u00a0It was a solid dish, but it paled in comparison to what had come before. \u00a0 Throughout our meal, we received attentive, but very unobtrusive service from Roseanne and Jose (I think that those were their names). \u00a0Water glasses were filled promptly (and we were drinking lots of water to rehydrate from the previous night's overindulgence) and empty dishes were cleared quickly.In the end, Momofuku Ss\u00e4m Bar was in many ways the food highlight of our trip to New York and one of the best meals I've ever had. \u00a0There's a lot of good to say about food that appears simple in concept but is so well-executed from the skill of the kitchen staff and the choice of fresh, high quality ingredients that it takes you to a place where you think of meals shared in the company of family and close friends. \u00a0I love this place after just one visit!", "Date": "2012-02-25", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "Yiwen S.", "ReviewID": "fuZ2ewizG4YM7gu0Xi8ziQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ok david chang, you've redeemed yourself. after my last encounter with your noodle bar left me disappointed with your ramen, i was loathe to ever return. but when my friend mentioned bo ssam, my heart kind of skipped a beat.so our party of 9 made a reservation exactly 6 weeks in advance for bo ssam and on that magical saturday afternoon, we convened, we devoured, and we conquered.9 people. $200. a whoooole lotta juicy, tender, fall-off-the-bone pork. copious amounts of rice and lettuce to wrap it all together. top it all off with some kimchi paste and other sauces, and you've got yourself 9 very stuffed and fully satisfied people.oysters on the half shell to start were a nice touch, too.", "Date": "2011-10-04", "Author_Location": "Philadelphia, PA"}, {"Author": "andrew c.", "ReviewID": "UG6EnODWMj9zCwT8tf5ArA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "\"Does anyone else out there think David Chang is sleeping with the entire world?\" - Deborah H.As recently as last week, I was hesitant to share Deborah's sentiment. \u00a0I really loved Ko, and although I disliked Ssam bar, I had only been there once before and was willing to give it another shot. \u00a0But, after last night's Bo Ssam meal, I've decided to finally quit you David Chang! \u00a0At one time, I found joy in tracking a rising chef whose perspective on food and how it should be experienced mirrored my own. \u00a0Most appealing, he shared my love for pig, and uncompromising antipathy for vegetarians. \u00a0And in theory, his melding of cultures, sometimes whimsical cooking, and minimalist approach to restaurant amenities (no fancy pants service, cheap disposable chopsticks crammed into tabletop jars, and napkins piled high at the center of your table) was everything I was looking for in a restaurant. \u00a0However, now I'm truly wondering (and clearly not the only one), is David Chang in bed with the world? \u00a0His food isn't that good and its expensive. \u00a0Japanese chain restaurants do better making ramen than Momofuku Noodle Bar (Ippudo and Setagaya both kick Momo's ass - Morimoto's biased noodle rankings were only a result of DC's shady, although admittedly intelligent, anticipation of Morimoto's arrival, allowing DC to serve Morimoto in person). \u00a0The Chinese do better with pork buns (although this is a much closer race and Chinese win only due to cost considerations). \u00a0And finally, the Koreans do a FAR better job with bossam. \u00a0I'm Chinese, but I LOVE Korean food and know how to appreciate good Korean food when I have it. \u00a0At Ssam bar, the kim chi tasted like it was store bought and maybe even had MSG in it. \u00a0My friends' moms make a better kim chi at home. \u00a0I felt the ssam jjang was too salty. \u00a0But worst of all, the slow roasted pork butt was a poor form of protein for this dish. \u00a0Although the pork was falling off the bone, extremely tender and very well-cooked, the meat could not hold its own in the wrap. \u00a0The whole thing felt like mush in your mouth. \u00a0There was no textural contrast, no strength in the wrap at all. \u00a0The Bibb lettuce was flimsy and weak, as well, and two leaves were needed just to hold the wrap together. \u00a0It lacked that crispness and crunch you get from the red leaf lettuce typically used. \u00a0And again, the pork was cooked to perfection, but incredibly tender is not always appropriate, and used in a wrap like that, it just did not work (maybe in a sandwich it would've been awesome). \u00a0I would've been way happier going to Myung Dong (NJ Korean restaurant) and eating bbq grilled, 1/4 inch cut ssam gyup sal (pork belly) in red leaf lettuce with all the accompanying ban chan (side dishes), and spent half as much in the process. \u00a0I understand that Ssam Bar is NOT supposed to be a Korean restaurant. \u00a0But, if you're going to to take a traditional ethnic dish or meal and modernize it, or add your own American take on it, then \u00a0make it better, not worse. \u00a0Change alone does not add value. \u00a0Also, in regard to service, I know amenities are kept at a minimum so a larger percentage of the tab goes to food, but still, you can hire waitstaff that don't seem like they hate working in your restaurant and despise all who eat there (Tall African American waiter with glasses and tattoos on his arm had a real attitude problem)My Ssam Bar experience has even caused me to wonder whether Ko's meal was really that good or if the psychological effects of its inaccessibility and hype coerced my weak mind into BELIEVING it was amazing. (I was going to try getting reservations again to see what the meal is like post price increase, but I'm officially abandoning all things DC)No matter, you can't blame David Chang for what he's chosen to do. \u00a0He had the pleasure of getting it on with 6 billion people, and in doing so, became famous, amassed enormous critical acclaim, and made a bajillion dollars. \u00a0So all the more power to him. \u00a0But where I once had respect and admiration, I can only feel sadness for what must be nothing more than a culinary harlot.", "Date": "2009-10-15", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "David L.", "ReviewID": "Dicd5uUmCwU-czoVT_pbmA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Zoinks. This is going to hurt... My favorite dish on the menu, which I've order again and again, is wildly and unbelievably inconsistent. Pigs Head Torchon. The first time I ordered it, I was off the wall with excitement and glee, priced at 19 dollars. Two big circles of amazing fried goodness. Then the price went up a dollar. Then each circle got smaller. Then the price went up a dollar. Then each circle got smaller. Then the price went up a dollar. Then each circle got smaller. That's just the way of the world. And though I can accept this, I honestly feel that the quality of the ingredients going into the product (HOW DIFFICULT CAN IT BE, when you're talking about the cheapest and generally least desirable cuts from a pig) are increasingly inferior... And then they took Lamb Belly off the menu... The way they serve beef tendon, to me, seems almost disgraceful. It seems treated in such a way and presented in such a way that it will never remind one of something undesirable... (DUMBED DOWN).. And, to be honest, it's an acquired taste/texture, which is part of the adventure... And then there's the super-overpriced bread and butter. In my humble opinion, better bread and better butter are given for free elsewhere... I've had pretty much everything here, again and again... The \"buns\" are delicious, but again inconsistent. One person will get what seems like three times as much meat (sometimes I'm that person, sometimes I'm not that person)... Sometimes the Hamachi is blindingly beautiful, and sometimes it's just plane bland... I've had the shortribs twice. After the first couple bites I always have to drown them in Sriracha to get any actual flavor... I've had the Manila clams twice and have been let down both times (one time I was served three unopened clams, a big no-no. the other time the bacon segments were completely undercooked).... Once I ordered the sweetbreads, another time a friend ordered the sweetbreads, and I thought they were terrible both times (whenever I see sweetbreads on a menu I order them, so I know what I like)... The three terrine sandwich was alright, I guess.. And, lastly, the kimchi (which is, according to what I understand of \"tradition\" is a part of the \"welcoming/gracious\" gifts from proprietor to patron) is just alright -- I've had many different versions, at varying levels of spice and tartness, but this one (which is not cheap) is just OK... Honestly, my opinion of this place is: They're trying to dumb-down the food--which is entirely understandable, they're trying to introduce what to most people are, let's just say, \"unfriendly\" ingredients, but in such a way that all integrity and identity are completely sublimated. It's pretty much like battering and deep-frying everything, except in the opposite direction. Let's just take all the flavor out of everything. Let's separate everything from everything else and charge for each individual part... And they're afraid of putting any actual spice into anything... To me it's like trying to do something like \"Jean-Georges\" without understanding exactly what they're doing... It's like they have no self-confidence, or no confidence in their ingredients, or no confidence in their clientelle...

My poor mother was getting cranky from a lack of food and watching me try on about 20 dresses at Topshop (I got stuck in the sleeves of one for a solid ten minutes and nearly threw out my neck during the struggle--always a picture of grace). She's always trying to get me to eat more meat (in addition to getting stuck in things, I'm infamous for fainting at really inconvenient times), so I figured there would be no better opportunity to exploit my poor out-of-town matriarch's wallet than by hitting Momofuku Ss\u00e4m. I had read countless articles and reviews and I've been aching to visit one of David Chang's restaurants for over a year, so my expectations were unfairly high.And yet this was unequivocally the most memorable lunch I've ever had in NYC.The complex but soulful flavors, the perfect portions, the price ($25 prix fixe for three courses), the laid-back atmosphere, the warm service (none of the staff wear uniforms, yet their laser-like attentiveness keeps them from blending in with the customers), and even the soundtrack (Beastie Boys' \"Ill Communication\" and various Beck tracks) were perfect. I'm not a fan of eating on bar stools unless I'm at an actual bar, but we were quite comfortable and cozy during our 1 and 1/2 hour visit. I ordered the Pork Buns, Spicy Rice Cakes, and the PB&J. I pressured my lovely mother into ordering the Kimchi Apple Salad, Braised Beef Brisket, and the Blondie Pie just to mix it up.The Infamous Pork Buns = fatty fatty fat fat, in the best way possible. There was a long pause after we started in on these bad boys. The Hoisin Sauce, Scallions, and Cucumbers kept things interesting; a little dab of Sriracha goes a long way. But I was even more impressed with the Kimchi Apple Salad, which was unlike any salad I've ever had: hot and sweet with mind-blowing Benton's Honeycrisp Bacon, fresh Arugula, and creamy Maple Labne. There were so many elements, but it all came together harmoniously. As far as beverages, Mom got a glass of the House Sake, which mysteriously disappeared in about 0.5 seconds. Lush alert! The wine list is pretty short, but who needs fancy schmancy liquor when there are four varieties of Root Beer to explore? As for the entrees, my Spicy Rice Cakes were a perfect comfort food, and the level of spice was just right for our sensitive Midwestern palates. The size of each rice cake was so pleasurable, and their firm texture complimented the spicy pork sausage and broccoli bits so well. \"Watch out for those peppers,\" our waiter warned. Done and done! Those bad boys were warming the bench (aka the side of my plate) as soon as the bowl hit the table. Szechuan peppers ain't nothin' to f--- with. My mom liked her Braised Beef Brisket (don't be misled by the seemingly shallow layer of meat and noodles hanging out in the bottom of the gigantic bowl--it's plenty of food) just fine, but no where near as much as the Spicy Rice Cakes. There was nearly a hand stabbin', but we didn't get regular flatware until dessert, so she lived to steal my morsels another day. With each dish, our waiter pointed out each individual element and asked whether we were ready for dessert instead of just plopping it down to rush us out, a professional touch that did not go unappreciated. Our happy but very full stomachs definitely needed a few minutes to relax....and here's where the PB&J comes in to blow my mind. \"With all the spiciness and meat, he's really setting us up for a rich dessert,\" my mother observed. She also decided that the Blondie Pie was misnamed, and proceeded to explain, in detail, exactly why while I just nodded my head and tried not to yell out how much I loved the strawberry jam that coated my entire plate, bumping up against a disc of Soda Cracker Panna Cotta and Crushed Peanut (mixed with butter, flour, etc) base. It snap, crackled, and popped in my mouth and hit every sweet spot. The jam was especially memorable. \"Just like Grandpa used to make,\" I remarked to Mom, still deep in her lecture about the pie's bottom layer of toffee, and we had ourselves a little moment. Not a buzzkill moment, or even a sad one; we were more grateful than anything else for being reminded of the Power of Nostalgic Flavors. This meal was truly amazing and one of the better values I've ever taken advantage of. Believe the hype.(Bows)Just for fun: If you order the Hudson Valley Foie Gras, all proceeds will be donated to City Harvest and the Food Bank NYC. \"That's one way of getting around that animal-cruelty controversy...\" whispered Mama H.

I'm not gonna say that this restaurant was busy, but it took a solo diner (me) to wait 45 minutes for one seat to open up at the long communal table; and it was very much worth the wait. The hostess took my name and was kind enough to ask me if I wanted a drink while I stood waiting. So I was in the mood for a beer on this unseasonably warm April Friday night. I ordered the classic San Francisco Anchor Steam. It had a deep amber color, thick creamy head and was exactly what I needed. There was a funny moment while I was waiting to be seated. Momofuku Ssam Bar in warm weather has a garage door entrance/exit right on the sidewalk. Two young ladies who I guess were not yet mentally prepared for these summer temperatures left the place by using the regular door that is the exit during the winter. When they realized they could have just walked outside on to the sidewalk with no use of a door, they started laughing so hard that everyone waiting also started laughing. It was hysterical. Finally, I was seated. I met two wonderful servers Emma and Nick and asked them to personally make the choices for a four course meal that would demonstrate why this restaurant made the San Pellegrino Top 50 list. So they conferred and went with a raw dish, then a small plate, a large plate and dessert. First up was the cured hamachi with edamame, horseradish and pea leaves. This dish was Masa good. Amazing! I loved how the horseradish gave a little kick when paired with the peas and velvety cool hamachi. Loved it! Before the next course, I ordered a glass of the Momofuku \"signature private label\" sake. It was a generous but potent portion that goes down like silk. It took some discipline on my part not to get ahead of myself too quickly or I would have been stumbling outta there. The second course selected for me was the Satur Farm's Fried Brussel Sprouts in a broth of sauteed mint, scallions, and fish vinagrette. The first few bites were sort of one note. The flavors weren't singing in harmony and I really couldn't taste the mint which disappointed me because I love mint. But as I spooned my way down to the bottom of the dish and got at the broth more, that is when my taste buds started dancing as my head bobbed to their Ipod soundtrack of The Cure, Violent Femmes and Joan Jett. A suggestion to Chef David Chang: this dish would be better served if you raised the level of the broth higher in the bowl so that all the ingredients can marry together more efficiently. For my entree, I was presented with the Bev Eggleston's Pork Shoulder Steak with a zucchini and ramp dressing. This plate was extraordinary. It truly eats like a steak texturely and is sliced into perfect one bite morsels. The pork was perfect al dente tender and the ramp sauce was sopped up in a heartbeat. A dish like this alone could give Momofuku Ssam Bar a Michelin Star. For dessert, I very much enjoyed the pear sorbet with pumpkin ganache and gorgonzola dolce. The juxtapostion of the rustic smoky woodiness of the pumpkin bounced off the sweet graininess of the pear in an intriguing way. Congratulations Chef David on earning on spot on the most coveted restaurant list. Before, you were a NYC renowned chef, now you are a \"world\" renowned chef. Four course dinner for one with drink, tax, and tip was $100.

Normally I think of chicken as the dish you order as a last resort, in a panic, when everyone is waiting for you to decide and nothing on the menu sounds appetizing. Clearly, I love chicken. However, as luck would have it, this bird was flavorful, moist, and (in my small, anti-chix world) uniquely presented. It was wrapped in rice, sitting on a plate of beautiful green sauce. Lastly but not least, the mussels. These were my pick and I have to say, not so bad. They arrived sealed inside a glass jar filled with juices, jalapenos, and some toasted garlic bread on the side. These were not like any mussels I've had before. The combination of flavors was a bit foreign to me but tasted just right. I would describe them as semi-spicy and almost pickled-tasting.As we originally predicted, the pork buns were the highlight of the meal BUT we were surprisingly impressed with the other plates.

Tofu Ssam?\" Our answer: \"Oh no, she got it already.\" His reply: \"Oh! That's chicken!\" THE COMEDY! Ohhhhh the trickery. Sounds like something I would do if I worked there to amuse myself. No not really.

The menu, while still heavily Korean influenced, was creative and delicious. The rice cakes were this great slightly sticky texture with ground pork sausage, braised collard greens, and kimchi spiced stewed together in a delicious, warm, spicy saucy mixture. The brussel sprout, garnished with fried puffed chickpeas and bits of bacon, was flavorful and interesting. The squid salad was light with the tang of vinegar and chili spice... and the hanger steak ssam was a do-it-yourself mooshoo-type of dish with amazingly tender and juicy steak to be wrapped in a giant bibb lettuce.

Ssam. \u00a0Madness.Prior to the trip in NY, I already knew I wanted to eat at one of the Momofuku's and I was able to book a group of 8 for the Bo Ssam Dinner at Ssam Bar. \u00a0It was a late dinner but we prepped ourselves thinking that we can take down this pork shoulder, but we had nooo idea.Sat down, and started off with some of the famous steamed bun. \u00a0It is essentially the Taiwanese guabao with pork belly but the version here comes with super succulent pork belly, hoisin sauce, cucumber, and scallions. \u00a0I've had a lot of guabao but this version's pretty damn close to the top of the top. \u00a0The pork belly is as tender and soft as it could be. \u00a0First bite was pure bliss, and every bite after I was just thinking... how the hell can I make pork belly as good as this??Then all the toppings for the pork shoulder came, as well as a dozen oysters that came with the whole dinner. \u00a0The oysters were fresh but really, we were all too excited about the pork that eventually arrived at our table.The pork shoulder is a huge. \u00a0Huge. \u00a0Roast a pork shoulder for 6-8 hours with simple brown sugar and kosher salt rub results in this amazing chunk of pork. \u00a0Most of the flavor is from the pork itself but the crust was great with the sugar all caramelized. \u00a0The pork was very juicy and I did expect a lot of fat but the cut was a good mix! \u00a0With the pork comes white rice, bibb lettuce, ss\u00e4m sauce (Korean bbq sauce), kimchi, chopped kimchi, and ginger scallion sauce to make the wraps with. \u00a0My favorite combo was definitely a piece of the pork with a nice crust, ssam sauce, a good amount of the chopped kimchi, and a generous generous amount of the ginger scallion sauce. \u00a0The ginger scallion sauce was all our favorite. \u00a0The nice ginger zing with the heavy scallion flavor was perfect with the pork. \u00a0I liked the chopped kimchi more versus the regular kimchi cause it acted more like a salsa and it was easier to eat!Really though, after about 3-4 wraps, I had to change it up, either with different amount of toppings, difference sauces, with rice, or even just using a different part of the pork! \u00a0It gets really heavy and towards the end, I just grabbed the bowl of rice and started to eat the pork like a charsu pork rice bowl with some kimchi haha. \u00a0In the end, the 8 of us only killed about 4-5 lbs out of the 8-pounder that we got. \u00a0Pretty sad... Is it worth the $200? \u00a0Besides the meat sweat, I say yes, especially in a big group. \u00a0We had a blast and it is such a primal experience, just using our hands to tear off the juicy pork and eating with our hands! \u00a0Next time I will probably just order off the regular menu, but still definitely an experience and am really glad I got to experience the glorious of the pig shoulder with 7 of my good friends!", "Date": "2012-04-10", "Author_Location": "Torrance, CA"}, {"Author": "B D.", "ReviewID": "D_LTXLNiQ1T4ZrhF8LNQMA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sat at a bar height community table on high bar stools -under the table is a coat and bag hook, clever for the tight space of the restaurant. \u00a0Only tried a couple of dishes -the bun with pork belly and slaw and the sliced duck with watercress served over rice.

But the New Yorker profile tipped me off to David Chang's bustling Korean fusion empire and the Ssam Bar seemed like a tasty place to try before heading over to Webster Hall to cover a show. The reviews here were all over the place and the hype is, obviously, at an all-time high. I tried to keep my expectations at an even keel and the following lines will inform you how it turned out for myself (and friend).It's true that the service is a bit to be desired. Or \"asshole,\" if you will. Not that it was awful but you can feel a certain amount of negative energy in their vibe. It's terse and frank for the most part. And I can understand that they probably have a ton to do and not any time to become friends but after taking our time to figure out our order and being asked a few times in quick succession if we were ready nobody was around or checking their iPhones on the line when we eventually figured it out. Another odd thing was when dessert time came I wondered if there was any Port and one of the servers poured a sample of Sherry, took a deep inhale, drank the slug in front of me and THEN inquired if I wanted it. How was I going to order something I had no part in tasting or deciding if it was complementary to the Port request? I wrote that whole service thing off as too-cool-for-school Manhattan eatery. Employees against guests. I get it. You're in our spot and you'll go with it or go without. It's not the only place like that so I'm not going to let that effect the food.On to the food: We started with the diver scallops which had pickled cherries, and to be honest, the other details escaped me in their brisk description. But there was a nice balance of acid and fresh, creamy scallops. The portion was decent (for high end). We also ordered the grilled sweetbreads and the Ssam Pork Belly. The sweetbreads came with some pickled veggies (which again, escaped me in their ultra-brisk description). We guesstimated some root vegetables including carrots and turnips. The sweetbreads themselves were very salty. Even on the verge of too salty. But they were cooked well and I'm forgiving of salt as long as I can cut it with something else and the pickled veggies did that. My favorite was adding it to the leftover lettuce \u00a0from the pork belly. The pork belly (my second in one week. I'm going on hiatus for a while) was very fatty and too much for my friend. But I loved it. I'll admit. And I got to enjoy more of the portion because it was too much of a grease bomb for her. The accompanying mustard seed sauce and garlic with (razor clams? really? it was non existent) was tasty.Do I NEED to go back? Meh. I might try and get a table next time and not that pointless option in front of the door. But I recommend the pork belly if you can live on tofu and salad the rest of the week.

I judged him for serving dishes that can be had for a fraction of the price in \"authentic\" restaurants to \"suckers\" that don't know any better. Boy, am I eating my words right now - when I'd rather be eating a Momofuku pork bun. \u00a0My first introduction to Momofuku was through my generous uncle who invited my family to partake in the bo saam. \u00a0Didn't get to eat the pork buns at this meal but man oh man I had one of the best pork dishes of my life. The experience of communal eating also contributed to my enjoyment of the meal. Although the meal was delicious, I still wasn't convinced of the momofuku hype because what meal doesn't taste good when it's free, nah mean? My next Momofuku experience (done twice) was the fried chicken meal at noodle bar. This is where I finally tasted the amazing pork buns, realized a world of ramen beyond oodles of noodles and fried chicken done right. My most recent Momofuku experience was the duck meal at saam bar. Again with the pork buns, \u00a0steamed and BBQ. The steamed were perfect but the BBQ was too \"American\" and lacked any interesting flavors. The tripe we ordered as an appetizer was thinly sliced and delicately seasoned - this was a fail for me. I prefer to chew on big chunks of stomach lining that feel like bazooka joes in the mouth. Another appetizer, the pork with rice cakes was so so good - way better than any rice cake dish I've had at Korean restaurants. I would want like 4 orders of this, hide in a closet somewhere so I don't have to share with anyone, eat it, and then cry from shame. \u00a0Now, the duck. The sausage stuffed duck breasts were perfectly cooked and seasoned. This threw me for a loop b/c at first I couldn't find the sausage stuffing and then I was all like oh snap, it's the same coloring at the duck breast! Fancy. The legs were confit'd which I didn't fully appreciate b/c it was kind of bland but crispy skin is always a treat. The rice and scallion pancakes were a bit too oily for my liking (albeit tasty) but filled the void in my tummy due to insufficient duck meat - I don't blame the restaurant for this, I'm just greedy.Hipsters usually annoy me but I find the hipster servers at Momofuku to be delightful.

The banh-mi was superb, the bread toasted to perfection (charred on the outside for a crusty delicious flavor) and the filling is rich, meaty and totally oozes that velvety texture that good pate & head cheese is supposed to have. The menu only describes the filling as \"three terrine sandwich\", but I'm assuming it's similar to a typical banh-mi filling (pate, pork & head cheese). Ssam - when recommending this to friends, I always say, \"it's like a Korean burrito - yes I know it sounds crazy, but it is totally and completely delicious.

The apple / lychee/ smoky bacon combo was genius, though. Overall, I had a fantastic meal. The place was a bit cramped, but the food was great and really reasonable for the hipness quotient. I'd go back - the owners are doing amazing things with my favorite animal protein.

On a cold, frigid night, nothing fills or warms the stomach up better than good company and a rather large hunk of meat. And when said hunk of meat happens to be a la the infamous David Chang... well, you've got quite a night ahead of you!We made reservations for bo ssam @ 6:30pm. Don't be afraid to leave a message- the reservationist will get back to you. Somehow, we managed to squeeze in a good nine people into one of those tightly-packed laquered picnic tables, literally sitting back-to-back with some of NYC's best chefs. It's true, even they love dining here, and we chatted and rubbed elbows (and derrieres.. oops!) with Jacques Pepin and head chefs from Aquavit, the Culinary Institute, Boulud, etc. They didn't invite us to their table but at least we're now, like, close-personal-friends with Jacques himself. We call him JP. The dishes are quirky interpretations of both gourmet and homestyled dishes with French and Asian influences. Portions are on the small side but the quality and freshness of the ingredients can't be beat. Thus, when the nine of us (somewhat tightly-budgeted college students) gathered for food, we figured the bo ssam would easily fill us up (it did) but wanted to taste a wide variety of dishes. \u00a0We shared bread & butter, brussel sprouts with puffed rice, ddukbokki, grilled sweetbreads, and kimchi + fiji apples. Trust in David Chang to take a seasonal veggie and turn it into the best dish of the night. Fried, sauteed, blanched, pureed, seasoned-- whatever it is that he does, they come out so well!When the emphasis is on appreciating and enjoying good food (quality over quantity) and conversation flows abundantly at the table, then the experience at Ssam is wonderful. Our bo ssam came out steaming hot, fatty, and glistening with glaze. A huge pork fat fan, I was very satisfied with our piece of meat, greedily tearing off as much skin, fat, and meat as I possibly could. With five men in our party, we still had a little leftover making the bo ssam (with oysters and bibb lettuce) a great deal for a good amount of food and a lovely night out. Somehow, with all this food and a few Brooklyn Pennant Ales, our bill \u00a0came out to be less than $30 a person. I believe prices have gone up, but I definitely have plans to go again.

Sliced clams on the side were good with it.Steamed egg with escargots - it's egg, chicken broth and a couple of escargots dumped on top.Hokkaido sea urchin - completely ruined with the whipped tofu that was overpowering, a sticky/slimy texture, the crunchy japanese flakes they dumped on top, and then brown sugar sweetened tapioca??? the heck? Roasted Lamb Belly - turned out really dry, and we only ate one piece out of the 4 that were served.

Truth be told it my experience was accidental. I meant to take my fiance to the dessert bar, which for those who have never been is attached by a small hallway in the back of the restaurant. However, the dessert bar does not have any seats and we were exhausted (and hungry), so we decided to sit at the bar for a quick appetizer before going to eat tapas elsewhere. The first thing to note is that ambience while nice is not all that inviting. Its architecture and furniture scream modern and sophisticated, and I guess if anything it fits with the general mood and food of the place. We tried the pork buns, as they have been touted as some of the best in New York. And true to form they were great, mainly because of the quality of pork they used. Otherwise all the other ingredients are pretty much the standard fare that you would get with pork buns in Chinatown. We also tried their special - a play on a BLT pork bun, which while eclectic and fun, was not nearly as tasty. Which brings me to the philosophical question of \"when is too much, too much?\" I always thought of Chinese food as comforting and homey. And while David Chang has certainly pushed the limits of culinary expectation, I feel like he has consequently lost some of the charm of the Chinese food which he has drawn upon. When I think of Chinese food, I think of round tables with family sitting around, and the spinning of the Lazy Susan being the most work you'll have to do during the meal. The food large in quantities being served family-style being both simple yet authentic. I think it will work, because David Chang knows his audience.

The waiters were helpful in explaining what was in every dish, and the food came pretty quickly. No complaints on my end there...Not to reiterate what everyone else has said, but the pork buns here are awesome. We got the special buns, which had crispy pork, avocado, spiced mayo, and radish...so freakin' good. A bit pricey at $6 a pop, but absolutely delicious nonetheless. Our brunch selections were also well-done, in particular the beef cheek pie. The beef itself was very tender and melted in your mouth; my only regret is that the oyster sauce that covered the pie dominated the dish and made it very difficult to get the beef taste unless I plucked out individual pieces. The beef noodle soup was overpriced for the amount of noodles that were in it (which was shamefully little, IMO), but the broth had a very rich, hearty flavor to it - but without the heaping amounts of salt/MSG that usually are included. The sirloin and other beef parts were also delicious, and the oranges that were included provided a surprisingly complementary taste to the dish. Dessert was the orange sorbet drenched in grand marnier soda - a very interesting mix that worked out very well, given the acidic nature of the sorbet combined with the carbonated liquer.It was definitely a bit pricier than I anticipated for a brunch stop, but the food here is absolutely delicious.

After becoming gauzily jaded by the self-righteous pretensions of NoCal fine-dining, I cooked avidly out of the Momofuku cookbook. What I found there was a f*** me jolt to every pleasure receptor in my brain. Yes, NoCal makes some of the best food in the nation, if not the world; but more often than not we see the same moves from beautiful women who wear the same clothes, the same hairstyles, and the same perfumes. There is pleasure there, but too much of the same thing is another cliche of hell - when an original beauty walks into the room, thy molecules rearrange, and thou shall dream differently that evening. This is my oblique way of saying that I understood David Chang's 'fig gate' comments to be true to the core. Momofuku's food? Exciting, daring, and original - David Chang is a chef whom the foodies are going to learn to love to hate. But here's the thing - the hype is deserved. (Besides, foodies are slack enough between the ears to call themselves foodies in the first place.) Precious, this food is not - an explosive revelation upon the palate, it is. Will it please all palates? No. It is seasoned heavily, it is brash and ballsy, and many people prefer having a quiet night at home with steamed vegetables and a rubber-dry chicken breast.Even though my trip to Ss\u00e4m Bar was destination dining, I was focused on eating what I had not cooked from the Momofuku cookbook. Since I ended up eating here after eating at Mercer Kitchen earlier in the evening, I only tried a few new things.The Santa Barbara uni with lomo, preserved tomatoes, minced Asian pear, and desiccated rice bits. If there is uni, I am there - and if it's Momofuku's take on uni, I'm there with dust in my trail. The dish was not staggeringly impressive, but it was everything that makes Momofuku so original and tasty. Excellent.The steamed pork belly buns with a smear of hoisin, simply pickled cucumbers, scallions, and (voluntary) Sriracha hot chili sauce. This is one of the most perfect sandwiches to ever fit in a human hand. It satisfies on every level - eyes, hands, mouth (sweet, salty, savory, and spicy). The pork belly collapses on your tongue like a metaphor above my pay grade. Don't believe me? I came back the next day and ate a couple more.I also tried the special of the day, which was a tofu white truffle dish. This was a warm tofu preparation that had the texture and visually gelatin surface of a savory panna cotta. This was topped with shaved white truffle (which is why it cost $50). I believe there was a flaw here - while the dish tasted good (the texture was great), it tasted like mildly altered tofu, which means faint and inexpressive. The sea salt served on the side is necessary. Moreover, it arrives covered, so when the lid is lifted the essence of the truffle is supposed to bloom. In our case, that truffle essence was too brief and mostly lost from spending too much time under the lid. Since I detected no truffle oil, I admire the purity of what this dish attempted. But for $50, I'd say it would be a pass for most diners. I would be remiss not to recommend a couple dishes that I did not eat this particular night.Spicy pork sausage and rice cakes with Chinese broccoli, Sichuan peppercorn, kochukaru (crushed red chili pepper), folded in tofu, green onions, dried hot peppers (many), and crispy shallots. This is the kind of meal that makes you sweat and its richness and full impact umami is hard to describe. This is hot, this is old-school Sichuan delightful, and it has fast become one of my crave meals.Bo Ss\u00e4m! Pork butt is brined in salt and sugar, coated with more sugar, and then slow roasted and basted in its own juices until the skin is crisp and the meat is falling off the bone. Served with oysters, pureed kimchi, ginger-scallion sauce, a gochujang-samjang sauce (fermented bean pastes - the gochujang being spicy), rice, and bibb lettuce. This is a classic Korean meal with the Momofuku twist being the higher excellence of all the ingredients - put portions of everything on a lettuce leaf, wrap it up, and enjoy.To drink, try the Mustard Pretzel, which is Old Weller 107 bourbon, mustard, celery, and pretzel. It's a savory drink, like few other cocktails you'll ever have, and you'll probably be sated by just one. The Seven Spice Sour, which is Togarashi infused sake, lime, and yuzu, you could drink all night long - it has a nice snap to its finish.For dessert, stroll down the hallway to Momofuku Milk Bar - your significant other can thank me in the morning.Finally, I should note the space - it's a small, dark bar. Get over it - the food kicks ass like John McEnroe's annus mirabilis of 1984.

appropriate Subway Line to get me to the stadium I was glad to see the 4 ran right past Ssam and figured I'd easily have an hour for dinner before having to hop the subway. \u00a0Arriving literally one minute before they unlocked the doors.The first one there I was pleasantly surprised by the Led Zeppelin playing across the stereo (Night Flight - followed by Houses of the Holy, 10 Years Gone, and Moby Dick plus some Rush and Stones) and told to sit \"wherever I liked.\" \u00a0Wanting to watch the kitchen and chat with the staff I opted for the bar, took a seat, grabbed a menu, and sipped my water (once again, like Noodle Bar, the water-refills were literally nonstop.) \u00a0Inquiring about the hams and a few other items I opted to go with one appetizer, one main, and save some room for dessert - placing my order I sat back, listened to the great tunes, and watched the place literally fill up within 25 minutes of opening. \u00a0Chatting with two of my servers about everything from New York to Medicine to music I must admit that although I love formal/classic service, there is something to say about the tattooed hipster servers who keep things extremely professional yet can also interact personally at places like Ssam, CUT, and other \"upscale yet trendy) places.After less than 10 minutes my first dish arrived - pork and foie gras terrine - toasted bread, quince, pickled ramps, and maple. \u00a0 Clearly not the level of pretense laid upon most foie preps, the cold terrine was actually quite bizarre in appearance with \"cubes\" of foie intermingled in a chopped ham pate. \u00a0Uncertain what to expect I took a bite and, honestly, was blown away - the taste was not expected. \u00a0Unthinkably the smoky and textural ham lent a nice foil to the fatty and smooth foie and the two ingredients melded well as a spread for the still-warm bread. \u00a0Hints of maple, I think blended with the ham, took on a greater accent when the quince jelly was added to the mix while the pickled ramps added another degree of acidic-yet-savory crunch to the dish. \u00a0Inventive and wonderful - I'd order it again.Watching the preparation in the wide open kitchen for a bit and chuckling as one of the cooks apparently brewed up some sort of strange cocktail that many of the staff were drinking I sipped my water and chatted with another patron at the bar for about 10 minutes before my main course arrived - bell & evan's fried chicken with ramps, morels, egg. \u00a0Not generally one to order chicken, after the miraculous piece at Crop two days prior and the accoutrements \u00a0being two of my very favorite things (morels and eggs) everything about this dish just sounded right - and it was. \u00a0Flawlessly tender and exquisitely succulent I was actually glad that the server had told me the chicken was a \"blend of dark and white basted with pork fat\" prior to ordering it or I'd have been dumbfounded as to how someone managed to make white meat so juicy yet crispy and well done. \u00a0Complemented beautifully with the sensuous and aromatic morels plus fresh and mildly pungent ramps and smoothed out with the creamy egg yolk - arguably the best fried chicken preparation I've ever had and challenged only by the miraculous version at San Francisco's famed Boulevard.Two stellar courses down I'd already scouted ahead on the menu and read of a dessert simply too unique to pass up. \u00a0Titled beet and lime ganache - goats milk frozen yogurt, pistachio the dish was actually beautifully creative resembling an artist's pallet with the ganache painted against one side of the bowl and the yogurt and nuts at the base. \u00a0Tasting first the ganache I was instantly impressed by the complex interplay of the sour lime and the earthy beet, yet how smooth the overall texture was on the tongue. \u00a0Next tasting the frozen yogurt and pistachio I was surprised at the overall saltiness but wowed at how the creamy vibrance of the yogurt worked with the crunch and texture of the nuts. \u00a0Finally, mixing all three components together I truly \"got\" the dish as everything just worked together to touch every part of the tongue and truly create a whole new dish - difficult to explain but definitely a case where the whole was greater than the sum of its parts and the most challenging yet impressive dessert I'd experienced since Providence.Honestly, if Chang didn't have his Honestly, if Chang didn't have his reputation - which is well deserved - Ssam, just like noodle bar, would be one of those \"neighborhood places\" that

attendee details at a later point. \u00a0Besides the fact that I never turn down a culinary invitation, I had yet to visit one of David Chang's restaurants, so I jumped at the opportunity. \u00a0I arrived at the packed restaurant, careful to heed my friend's warning that we MUST be seated by our 6:30 reservation or we would lose our table. \u00a0I pushed my way over to the hostess, who ever so gracefully escorted me to my group's table. \u00a0The friendly woman was surprisingly sweet and relaxed, though every seat in the space was full, and a line was forming at the door. \u00a0I looked over at my friends who were already crammed into the table and felt uncomfortable asking them to make room for me. \u00a0One friend considerately scooted over and created a space on the long bench against the wall. \u00a0Though we had planned on six diners, we had become 9 and had to squash 4 people to a side on a small rectangular table, with another friend stuck at the head. \u00a0Unfortunately, Momofuku did not provide a coat check, and we basically had to keep our puffy winter jackets in our laps throughout the meal. \u00a0This was probably my main pet peeve, because I spent a substantial amount of money to eat uncomfortably. \u00a0But, boy, did I eat!! \u00a0We started our meal with carefully selected bottles of Malbec and Sauvignon Blanc, which one of my fellow diners thought paired best with our courses. \u00a0Though we had a lengthy procession ahead of us, we just had to sample the Steamed Pork Buns, which I had heard were completely amazing. \u00a0The moist dough was curled over the meat, resembling more of a taco than a large dumpling. \u00a0Unfortunately, the bun's outer layer was served at room temperature, though it would have been more enticing if was plated as warm as the pork stuffing. \u00a0Due to the creative fashion of the wrap, our mouths began to water at the sight of the sauteed meat filling pouring out of its sides. \u00a0Thick slices of marinaded, fatty pork goodness lay atop crisp cucumber rounds and spicy scallions. \u00a0A sweet hoisin sauce equated the flavor profile to that of Chinese Moo Shu Pork. \u00a0Each small sandwich oozed with meaty juices that poured all over our hands, but did little to distract us from the pleasure granted by each bite. \u00a0Since this appetizer portion came as two buns, we had 10 succulent bites for 9 people. \u00a0How were we to determine who was lucky enough to receive a second helping. \u00a0Various challenges were suggested, including a Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament. \u00a0In the end, we all chickened out on the additional fatty dosage and gifted the prize to a recent marathon runner among us. \u00a0Just as we were wiping the sauce off of our chins, the attentive waiters followed up with our main pork feast. \u00a0The Bo Ssam included a massive round roast of pork butt, a dozen oysters, kimchi, rice, bibb lettuce, and various sauces. \u00a0The task was to grab a large, brilliantly green leaf of lettuce and top it with slices of fall-off-the-bone pork, salty oysters, sticky white rice, and one of the accompanying sauces. \u00a0The interactive meal was spectacularly entertaining for a large group, because it enabled us to use the table as our own little assembly kitchen. \u00a0Each wrap held a heavenly blend of textures and savory flavors. \u00a0The pork butt had a slightly crisped crust, but was full of tender juiciness within. \u00a0The marinade had a barbecue-like sweetness to it, which helped season the somewhat bland pork. \u00a0The oysters were delicate and subtly tasted of the sea. \u00a0The kimchi was very saucy and could have used some additional cabbage. \u00a0However, dabs of the bean paste, red pepper dip, and scallion oil were terrific ways to enhance each wrap. \u00a0The Bo Ssam was so fantastic that the more we ate, and the more we complained about how full we were, the harder it was to stop picking at the shared plates. \u00a0I cannot count how many times we each said, \"Ok, I am done!\" before definitively cutting ourselves off. \u00a0Well, eventually we ran out of meat and mainly the bare bones remained, so we had little choice at that point. We quickly settled our bill, which we were pleasantly surprised cost us only $60 a piece. \u00a0Then, though ready for a nap, we could not avoid a trip to the adjoining Milk Bar for some after-dinner treats.We also ended the night with plans to revisit the fabulous Momofuku Ssam for their famed fried chicken dinner. \u00a0Ahhh...the life of a foodie is never fulfilled!", "Date": "2010-01-08", "Author_Location": "Hoboken, NJ"}, {"Author": "Robyn F.", "ReviewID": "zHUvY9laO7VxkgawvJ4s_Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been to a few of the Momofuku restaurants, and most of them were disappointing (ma peche, noodle bar). \u00a0Ssam was a pleasant surprise. \u00a0We tried the pork shoulder steak, the baby artichokes, the terrine, the chili crab, and the bbq sandwiches. \u00a0The pork shoulder steak and the BBQ sandwiches tied for my favorites, with chili crab coming in as a close third . \u00a0The other dishes were passable and had smaller portion sizes. \u00a0I will definitely come back to try the other dishes!", "Date": "2010-06-08", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Michael C.", "ReviewID": "cWFgd1U7VTKN9jq8ryzr_A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't even bother to describe the meal I had...words could not express how much I enjoyed every bite and every explosion of flavor. \u00a0JUST GO AND ENJOY!", "Date": "2012-06-01", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "S C.", "ReviewID": "3va3qX7_KbBZrPSEr0VZhg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I could eat the pork buns every day of my life.

So, who am I to criticize? But...First of all, the tables are communal. This isn't really my favorite way to eat a meal, crammed elbow to elbow with other diners, but I'm not a native New Yorker so I think I have a bigger \"personal space\" bubble than the true locals. Either way, this isn't a deal breaker; I love Kampuchea and it employs a similar seating style.However, they sat us a at a long, skinny communal table. My boyfriend and I were seated across from each other. To my immediate right was the bus-station (piles of dirty plates and glasses). To my left was a girl with THE MOST ANNOYING VOICE I've ever heard in my life. She was loud and skwaky and was bitching at her husband the entire time. As a result, I couldn't have a conversation with my boyfriend for the first half of the meal (until she finally left) and so we sat there in an awkward, unenjoyable silence. Hence, the atmosphere sucked. It would have been better if we had been sitting next to each other. The food is not quite tapas-style and not quite family-style but you're encouraged to share your meals (portions are the size of appetizers). We ordered a few dishes. The first few (pickles, 1/2 dozen oysters, and mussels) came out on time. We waited forever (20 minutes passed since we received the mussels) for the next dish (I think it was some sausage dish but I can't remember). I know the waitress heard me order it because she told me how good it was and she warned me that it would be spicy. We never got the dish and when I stopped some other crackhead waitress as she passed behind me, she barked at me that she would be right with me. She was in such a hurry that she couldn't see what I, a customer, might want. She rushed to the back to...deal with an emergency?...put out a fire?...place an order?...NO...she was in such a hurry because she didn't like the song that was playing so she changed the playlist to something else and started dancing around the kitchen! Yeah, not so important. Oh, and she never came back.So we sat there longer, still waiting for our food. Our waitress was nowhere to be found. On top of that, our drinks went empty halfway through the meal and we were never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. No one asked if we wanted a second drink, if we wanted more food (keep in mind, we hadn't even had much to eat still so you'd think someone would realize we might want to order more), we weren't even offered a desert menu.Finally, I stopped the manager and asked for the check and told him to take the dish we never received off of it. He apologized and asked us if we still wanted the dish. I told him we didn't and that we just wanted to pay and leave. So, he asked if we'd want to take it with us. I told him we did not want it because we were going out, not home, and we didn't want to carry food with us.He brought us the check along with the dish in a paper bag! Yeah, thanks for wasting the paper bag but I said we didn't want it and I meant it. We paid and left the bag sitting there. We left the restaurant hungry, frustrated and disappointed.The hipster waitstaff is completely out of it or high or something. They were so busy socializing with each other and singing to their indie-pop that they couldn't take a minute to make sure the diners were eating and drinking (generally the reason customers come to restaurants, right?).The food that we did eat was fine but it didn't make up for the rest of the experience. More specifically, the pickles consisted of a big bowl of pickled vegetables (cucumbers, carrots, daikon, kimchee, mushrooms, etc.) and tasted fine but slightly offensive due to an overpowering taste of vinegar. The oysters themselves were good but they served them with their own accoutrement that was very salty. The oysters come out with the condiment already on top so, if you don't like the flavor (which we didn't), you're S.O.L. They tasted like what you would expect an oyster to taste like if you cracked it open straight out of the ocean--salty and bland but fresh. The mussels were actually really good and the focaccia that came with it was delicious. It had some type of pork product (pork shoulder? thick-cut bacon?) in the dough and tasted great when you dipped it in the mussel broth. The mussels made us look forward to our next dish--but you know how that turned out...Their wine and beer list is unimpressive and they don't have a full bar.I can't speak to desert since we didn't make it that far before severing our losses and bowing out.We planned to grab a bite at Pegu Club to settle our lingering hunger but sadly, their kitchen was closed by the time we got there.

The cucumber completes these morsels so well.Tried the Octopus salad which wasn't as good as a similar dish I've previously had at the noodle bar, but still good. The Brussel's were as good as everyone says. My friend pointed out that they're basically a vegetarian Larb Thai salad (fish sauce, spice, mint) which probably explains why I liked them so much.The poached cod with pine nuts and black garlic with fancy mushrooms was good but a little too salty for my friend's taste. And finally the pork shoulder which was delicious as expected for a pork based dish in Momofuku.So why only 3 stars.. Previous visits to the noodle bar have had me using the word delicious far too many times; not so with the Saam Bar although everything was at least good, nothing was bad or average. I also made a mistake by ordering all the dishes at the same time, and they all came pretty quickly so there really wasn't time to finish one dish before the next came. I hoped they would have staggered the dishes a little more. In particular the poached cod was left standing getting cold whilst I finished other dishes. I know this isn't fine dining but this lack of attention to detail was frustrating when your $20 entree is going cold. I won't make the same mistake again, I'll just keep asking for the menu and order more dishes. This will be less efficient for them but at least my food will arrive when I'm ready.I also feel that there's a slight nonchalance about the service nowadays.

I was really excited about going after hearing my good friend (and Yelper) Chris G. talk so highly of it. Chris prepped me on the menu and what was good and what was great (because in his eyes, Chang can do no wrong). We settled into our table and tried to figure out the menu. It was hard to choose, mostly because we just weren't sure what we were getting. For starters, we decided on the steamed pork buns (two orders because there are only two buns per order) and the fried brussel sprouts. The dishes came out rather quickly and both were delicious. The brussel sprouts didn't even taste like brussel sprouts and shouldn't even count as a vegetable with all the oil they put on them. Still, they were the perfect blend of sweet and salty, crispy and chewy with a little bit of spicy. Y-u-m.I got the Spicy Pork Sausage and Rice Cakes which I was really happy with. The rice cakes are not what I expected but even better. My boyfriend got the pork belly wraps (I forget what they call it on the menu) and my aunt, who wasn't that hungry, got on of the ham dishes. The pork belly was good but left something to be desired. The ham, was just ham...not recommended.The servers had horrible attitudes though which is why I gave low stars. Our waiter had serious plaque build-up on his teeth that honestly distracted me from focusing on the specials he was rattling off and at one point he used the back of his hand to wipe snot from his nose after he sucked up into his brain. I was disgusted. A different server brought out the pork belly and squatted down to tell us about it and was basically breathing all over the dish. I don't know if I'm being crazy about this or not but I was really grossed out by the level of unprofessionalism. For the prices we were paying, I would expect much better service. Oh and I can't forget to mention that anytime we would ask a question, the tone from the waiter was very condescending. After we paid, we were just finishing up a conversation and the waiter came to ask if we wanted dessert...the same waiter that just closed out our check...if that doesn't scream \"Get out!\" I don't know what does. \u00a0The bill was $108 without tip.

Seating is limited there and the long tables are not open on each end -- meaning, you can pull up an extra stool to only one end of the table because the other end is a wooden board.

After reading a disquisition on XO sauce in NYMag and happening upon it on the menu here, I decided I couldn't pass up the chance to try this salty-sweet Hong Kong condiment whose exact origins are, intriguingly, a matter of local lore. I made the right decision. A combination of the sticky, fish-based XO with bok choy was a surprise success and upheld the Momofuku promise in which culinary risk and playfulness almost always pay off. The food at Momofuku is utterly gratifying, particularly to those of us with a penchant for the esoteric. We're asked to suspend our judgment on snails, quails, sweetbreads, pickles, obscure ingredients like XO and - yes - pig's ear. And for that we're rewarded. The oft-cited pork buns are, indeed, incredibly good. But no one should shy away from trying some of the dishes that have made David Chang an exceptional chef and a trendsetter in NYC's restaurant scene.

We walked on a raining Monday night to an unsurprisingly busy floor but were lucky enough to be seated immediately at the end of one of their shared tables. Partly because we were unsure of who the servers were (no uniforms here, but we finally realized that the men walking around in shorts were pretty much the staff) it was a wait before someone finally came to take our orders, but once we got our first round out of the way things were pretty much smooth sailing from there.Decor is modern simplicity; though the zen feel of all this can get lost when visually dealing with the amount of customers that fill the restaurant. But that's something to be said of the place in itself... turn-over is amazing, and its speed and consistency should be enough to speak for itself. And even if it took a while to get some initial attention, service is otherwise acceptable (don't be afraid to feign some level of [obvious] frustration- apparently it's what WILL get the staff's attention in the midst of the service melee; and then hold it!)We started out with the Steamed Buns, Blackened Bluefish Sandwich, Spanish Octopus and Roasted Lamb Loin& Belly. While the Buns were good they were just that: steamed cuts of pork belly with hoisin sauce for that added Asian flair; and while cooked right they were nothing to rave over (then again, pork dishes are staples where I'm from). The Bluefish Sandwich, on the other hand, was my definition of perfection, well spiced and topped with kale and miso between two slices of perfectly toasted bread; and despite it being considered a Small Plate I could have had this as an entree and been happy for the rest of the evening. The octopus was also good, not over-grilled and well complimented by the crunch of celery and salty ham chips. And my only negative comment about the Lamb is portion size, but that's really beside the point- the loin's doneness is heavenly (just look at that color!) while the belly is nicely crisp on the outside; and paired with egg yolk and bulgur this dish becomes very easily addictive.We'd planned to head off to another dining spot after this, but since the rain wasn't showing any signs of letting up we decided to parouse the rest of the menu. The Pork Shoulder was nothing short of divine when paired with the tartness of blue cheese, sweetness of sliced peaches and a hint of heat from the peppers (it's also one of the more substantial dishes on the menu). An order of finely sliced Edward's Wigwam Ham was also a beautiful plate of smokiness served with- what else- mustard and a little toasted bread. But a last-minute order of Spicy Honeycomb Tripe was, by our trio's agreement, by far the best of everything we'd ordered. I understand that the texture makes it hard for many to stomach (excuse the pun), but coming from a culture used to this ingredient, let me say that this certainly exceeded any of our expectations. Thinly sliced and mixed with a kick of heat, celery and strands of tomato added to the complexity of what should (just) normally be an otherwise chewy \"ehm\" dish. For those willing to be adventurous enough to step out of their comfort box, this is what I'd highly recommend (outside of the the Bluefish Sandwich, of course).Personally though I think things were overpriced for the kind of establishment that Ssam Bar is; mix in the \"just-ok\" service then you have my reason for the three-star rating. This isn't a place I'd visit again if I had to drive into the City myself, but it's still something I'd recommend first-timers to make a visit to. I'd go again if someone was willing to pick up the tab for another round of tripe! My opinion being just that (meaning mine, alone), I believe others might have another point of view to share...

Went with a party of 10 and was able to sample quite a few menu selections - none of it very memorable. Stand-out bad was the bread and butter, which most closely resembled (and maybe was) a half loaf of Pillsbury bake at home bread. Each piece cost $8.00 - I'm sure the owner is laughing all the way to the bank on this one. The pork buns were fine, but there is far better at any real place in Chinatown, at a fraction of the $4.50 per bun cost Ssam, Bar is charging. Truly tasteless was the Fuji Apple Kimchi with Jowl Bacon and Maple Lebne - The apple was mealy and the maple lebne was completely lacking in any flavor whatsoever - didn't taste of yogurt or maple. Just totally bland. The country ham and and the spicy sausage were also completely unmemorable. I suggest that the owner stop at any roadside diner in North Carolina or Virginia to find out what ham actually tastes like. \u00a0The Brussel Sprouts were, well, brussel sprouts.Finally, the crown jewel of bland flavorlessness is the Bo SSam itself, a whole pork butt (around 8 lbs) that costs $200. In case anyone here doesn't know what pork butt is, it is one of the cheapest cuts of meat you can buy - can often be had on sale for less than $1.00 a pound. It's the same cut of meat that many great barbeque places magically turn into pulled pork. Unfortunately, Momofuku turns it into what is without a doubt the most overpriced hyped up dish I have ever eaten, period. It is glazed with some sugar, baked for a long time, then heaped onto a plate with \u00a0some oysters, and served as if it is manna from heaven. Unfortunately, once you get inside the pork beyond the sugary outside of the butt you find nothing but completely unseasoned and bland pork. You can make this yourself at home folks - seriously. Just get an 8 lb butt, rub it all over with brown sugar and some soy sauce, and bake in a 250 degree oven for 8-10 hours. You'll get the same result, and will save yourself $190.00.If you're one of those people with no taste buds but a strong appetite for New York hipster restaurant hype, this is your place.

This is a sandwich's sandwich with that kind of \"ashamed of myself\" greasiness that real foodie's like. Sheesh . . I almost ordered another! \u00a0But just as I fell deeper in love, in came the order of spicy pork with rice cakes. SENSORY OVERLOAD! . . . The spicy sauce alone was orgasmic & I don't even like spicy food. (very hot!) Honestly, I'm lost on words with this one folks. It was just THAT FREAKIN' GOOD! I'm daydreaming of it as I type this & I've already planned to go back on Friday for more plus I'm trying the boneless porgy because yes, someone else ordered it & it looked amazing as I spied on their plate . . \u00a0(don't judge me dammit lol)SYNOPSIS: Trendy, scene-y, funky with plenty of opportunities to sit at the bar & spy on your neighbors food. Depending on what you order some plates can be notoriously small but the prices aren't too bad. No reservations is a bummer & the wait time for a table can be a tad bit excessive but all in all I think it's well worth it. Bottomline . . YOU'VE GOTTA TRY IT!

The atmosphere is very casual. It's loud, modern, and trendy. It's one of the many restaurants that jumped on the communal dining trend. Personally, I don't mind it but I feel like it has to be done right. Either it has to be at a restaurant where the vibe is somewhat homey, like Red Rooster or even the upscale chain Le Pain Quotidien, or very trendy and beautifies the space, like Socarrat, Betel, and the cellar bar at Andaz. Here at Ss\u00e4m bar, it feels too contrived. It makes you feel cramped instead of intimate. And it doesn't help that they bring out your dishes all at the same time unless you tell them not to. The service, overall was pretty good. Even though we came at 7 we were seated promptly. And when I didn't like the wine they first suggested I try they were quick to offer me a different one. The food.. I must say, it was better than I anticipated. Although I did steer clear from a couple of dishes that I expected not to like, the pork buns being one of them. I know I know, practically everyone raves about their pork buns but I'm a purist with certain comfort foods. My companion and I shared the following dishes: The Fuji apple kimchi (Originality: 5 stars, Presentation: 4.5 stars, Taste: 4.5 stars), which was very unique and creatively paired with bacon. I liked it a lot although I did want more spice. The oxtail dumplings (O: 5 stars, P: 4 stars, T: 5 stars) was my favorite dish of the night. It was bold and flavorful and the broth complimented the dumplings so well. The fish ball hot pot (O: 4.5 stars, P: 3.5 stars, T: 3.5 stars) was one of those dishes where I can see what he was aiming for but he somehow fell short. A hot pot should be served piping hot, number one, and although the various ingredients of clams, octopus, mochi etc were delicious as individual bites, the dish did not come together as a whole. Lastly, we had the short rib sandwich (O: 3.5 stars, P: 3.5 stars, T: 4.5 stars) which, although the simplest dish among what we ordered was actually executed perfectly that it was really enjoyable. The meat was tender, the bacon crisp, the cheese had enough bite, and the bread solid enough to hold everything together. I was disappointed with the dessert. I was happy to see that they actually had a couple of desserts on the menu instead of making you go to the adjoining milk bar. I tried the grapefruit curd (O: 4 stars, P: 3 stars, T: 3 stars). In my opinion whatever you choose to name your dessert, it should be the center piece of said dessert. In this case the curd was barely recognizable and was hidden under a convoluted plating of ice cream, biscuits, and honey. Again, I can see what he envisioned but sadly the realization of it fell short. Bottom-line I'd say the food is pretty solid. David Chang is inventive and fusion is his forte. And he has a heck of a PR strategy. For the quality of food and dining experience we had I have to say it was not worth the tab. So even though I am giving it 4 stars for the food I'd like to make it clear that I think it's overpriced.

I am no fan of tripe, but I love spicy stuff, and I was hoping David Chang would do his Asian food but not mojo and transform it into something I'd like. That didn't happen. I think if the flavoring was right, I could have closed my eyes and pretended I was eating really flat glass noodles, but the tripe was too salty. It was spicy, but not spicy to the extent the bartender's warning would seem to indicate. The spicy rice cakes were nice and crunch, but, again, too spicy and too oily as well.

Having been to the Noodle Bar and Ko on various occasions, I have to say that this incarnation of Momo isn't anything exceptional. Having said that, I would still recommend it if someone were to ask me for a casual place to eat with some friends. Of course, get the famous pork buns. Besides that, I think most things that I had tasted pretty good. The spicy sausage with rice cakes were a standout for me. The brussel sprouts were also very unique. Its a solid menu but \u00a0frankly, I wouldn't have thought it a bad idea if we all just ordered as many pork buns as possible and stuffed ourselves with that. One nice surprise was the Momofuku private label sake... very smooth and went nicely with the food.Pricewise, you can get stuffed and spend around $80 dollars/person with drinks tax and tip here. I spend around $180 for my meals at Ko. But somehow, I felt like Ko was a value while the food here was overpriced... go figure. I think the problem may be that the brand is so hyped that plain old good food just might not cut it. Ko wowed me for sure and while Ssam is significantly cheaper, I guess I just expected something unique.

Does Momofuku deserve the .5 extra star? It certainly does not! First time I went to Momofuku, I didn't know it was THE Momofuku everyone was talking about. It looked so \"plain\" (not that plain is bad) and unassuming from the outside. My cousin and I would have just passed by this place had we not been starving and we were desperate for some Asian cuisine lovin'. We tried what everyone raves about, the satur farm's fried brussels sprouts, seasonal pickles, steamed buns, and some rice dish (which I don't remember the name of as it was insignificant). I think the most memorable was the brussels sprouts. It was really spicy and oily, so you can only eat few at a time and it's best if shared with your friends. While eating, I just kept thinking, I wish I had a plate of rice with me because this surely tastes like new-age banchan (Korean side dish). For me, it appears that Momofuku strives on mediocrity presented on minimalist plates; yes, it's amazing how you were able to place that cute little pork bun on the white plate the size of titanic, but what else? I'm still ef-ing starving! But I still have to applaud the chef for introducing to the world the possibility of Korean fusion food, that it can go beyond eating pa jun with ketchup or kalbi with dijon mustard.

We also got the long island fluke in youzu and peaches, and a few orders of the diver scallops with pickled cherries and lemon puree. Service wise the place has its pros and cons. The staff were very nice and accommodating, especially the sommelier. After informing me that my initial wine choice was sold out I selected another. The sommelier returned asking if I would like the wine now, or later, while discretely pointing out the $450 price. Somehow, the $450 price did not register when I ordered the wine; I thought it was much lower. I'm grateful she came by to confirm.

Our party of nine made a reservation for the pig butt feast; and we received a 6:30pm time slot on Sunday.DECOR: standard, sleek NYC casual restaurant fare. A little too dark. Bad acoustics. Nice but not too attentive staff.DRINKS: On the pricier side compared to the food offerings. Beers are in the 8-11 range. Wines by the glass are in the 10-15 range. Bottles of wine and sake seem the way to go. After a few beers, we moved to the momofuku private label sake. I believe a bottle is about $45. Pleasant, mild taste. Won't blow your mind but won't hurt your palate.FOOD: We started with a few appetizers before digging into the massive pig feast. The pickled vegetables were nice but but not too remarkable. If you've been to Korean restaurants, you won't be too overwhelmed. The pork buns are very good. Very juicy and rich. I felt guilty liking them so much because they don't in any way feel authentic. But I got over that, realizing that is the point to the restaurant. Fancify traditional Chinese and Korean dishes but do it well. We also got the bread with homemade butter and lard. Totally not needed. The butter was good in that all butter is very good way. And lard on bread just wasn't a good combination. I like lard better when it's on dishes, like pizza or served with cured meats etc. THE MAIN ATTRACTION: bo ssam, aka pig butt. Actually not pig butt. The pig shoulder. After reading other people's experiences, I was expecting something the size of Goliath. And while it is one big chunk of meat. It's not earth shattering large. But then we started eating. And our group of nine couldn't finish. We made it through 80%. If we didn't get any appetizers, we may have finished. But what's the fun with that. The pig is very juicy and tasty. However, I didn't love the four accompanying sauces. The Kimchee was a little too \"new\" tasting -- didn't have that powerful fermented kimchee taste you get at good Korean restaurants. Same thing goes for the kimchee paste -- they should have served the Korean chili sauce instead (ko chu jang). The scallion sauce was okay, a little bland. The best of the four was the bastardized korean bbq sauce. Better sauces would have picked this meal up to another level. Our group disagreed about the oysters. Some people liked the oysters with the pork. Others thought it was completely a weird taste combination. I was neutral. A little gimicky but didn't hurt the meal. Overall, a really fun dish to experience in large group. Parts of the meal worked. Others didn't. Total cost: including drinks and lots of food = $55.

I also like getting any of their seasonal vegetable dishes (cauliflower, artichokes, brussel sprouts), and their raw seafood is also delicious (cured arctic char, yum). My friends also rave about the spicy rice cakes with pork, but I thought they were just okay. Of course, the bo ssam is a MUST and you have to try it at least once. I've had it twice, and both times it was delicious. The pork literally falls off the bone and is fork tender, and I love all the accoutrements that come with it (pureed kimchee is absolutely genius!). The first time we were a mixed boy/girl group of 10 and finished every last morsel but the second time I had it with 8 girls, and all of us got to take a hefty portion home since we couldn't finish it.

Takes spice and Asian flavors and creates new culinary experiences.Steamed buns of pork belly, hoisin, cucumbers, scallions ($10); only 2 come on this plate; not a traditional bun at all; it was more of a doughy taco; the bread (maybe ~3\" in diameter) was fluffy and slightly chewy (as it should be) and folded over 2 sliced ~1.5\" pork belly pieces; could have used more sauce, as I had to use more sriracha to give it more flavor. \u00a0The best part of it was definitely the bread. \u00a0It was a different bun experience, but nothing amazing. \u00a0Definitely worth a try, but will not necessary crave it. I would give it a 3.5 of 5 stars.Spicy pork sausage & rice cakes w/ chinese broccoli, sichuan peppercorn ($18) - definitely the best dish of the night; not really a sausage, as it was more ground pork mixed with chinese broccoli and spices; definitely not skimpy on the meat or chinese broccoli; salty (on the cusp of being overly but did not reach it); the best part was the rice cakes - they are 1\" pieces of the cylindrical rice cakes (in Korean, ddukboki duk) but they are incredible b/c they are really crispy on the outside and have the chewy inside. Decent portion for an entree. One of the most interesting dishes I've ever had. 4 or 4.5 stars out of 5 for this dishWild catfish w/ corn curry, green mango, peanuts ($23) - lightly breaded ~3\" square piece (the crisp was executed well); flavor was slightly above average (could have used more of a punch but had a balanced flavor); however, it was mushy at parts - almost to the point where I thought it was globs of fat and some parts were stringy (hard to cut through); good portion if you're not really hungry; I would give it a 3 or 3.5 overall flavor, but for the quality of the fish itself is 2 stars.

Finally, I came to New York on vacation and got my chance. They were even better than expected. Of the two types, I much preferred the steamed pork buns. The pork on these buns were unlike any I have ever had before. The fatty layer on top of each slice of pork was solid but supple, almost gelatinous. It was a really interesting texture. The meaty portion of the pork was moist and tender. The sweet hoisin sauce was a nice accompaniment, and the pickled cucumber was a nice tangy counterpoint to all the fatty goodness. The steamed buns encasing all of this was perfectly soft and pillowy. I had two of these buns as an appetizer, but the portion size is pretty hefty and could be a main course for those with smaller appetites. I also tried the crispy pork belly bun (which comes as a single large bun). Again, a pretty hefty portion of pork. The pork belly was a little too crispy for my taste, and had more of a southern barbecue taste to it than an Asian one. For my main course I had the poached chicken with sticky rice, which reminded me a lot of Singaporean style hainan chicken, only the rice was on top of the chicken instead of vice versa. It was accompanied by some sort of curry flavored sauce, which could of used a little spice IMHO. \u00a0Overall, it was a somewhat bland dish. If \u00a0had to do it again, I would have ordered more pork buns or possibly the spicy pork sausage. I was tempted to order the 64 oz dry aged ribeye for $100 (which actually is a great deal if you think about it).

We decided to order a few cocktails before dinner and I'll have to say the Manhattan was one of the better ones I've had in, well, Manhattan. I'm not sure what was so different about it but it made me order a second. Their liquor selection is limited, no vodka, but what they do have is interesting. We didn't think that we needed any extra food given the reviews on here about our meal. There were only 6 of us and most yelpers have written that food is left over with 8. We did order some steamed buns: pork belly, hoisin, cucumbers, scallions, in case we thought we weren't going to get enough pork with our Bo Ssam! The buns were so soft and the pork was perfectly cooked. On to the pork butt!! They served 2 large bowls of white rice, two bowls of lettuce leaves, 3 different sauces and kimchi. There was a scallion sauce and 2 different red sauces, 1 very spicy. Along with all that they serve a dozen oysters and you really do need to plop that oyster on the top of your wrap to get the true experience. As weird as it may sound it made a big difference.

Moved onto the steamed pork buns ( could legit eat two orders of these things on my own); the bbq pork sandwich, and the crab claws. Ok now truth be told, the crab claws were delicious, but I am lazy and hate how with crab I can never get all the meat out without a serious effort, not an issue for my friend, I made more of a mess than anything, so personally I wouldn't order them again, but that's just because as I said I am lazy and don't enjoy working for my food that much. As our \"entrees\" we got the fried artichoke, which was pretty much the best thing I've tasted in quite a while, I could have eaten the whole bowl by myself, along with the two orders of steamed pork buns of course, and we also got the beef terrine, which was good but I'm not a huge meat eater and had pretty much already had more than my fill with all the pork, so I only had a bite, it was good but I could skip it next time.

According to my hubby, and my visual acuity, the large $9 pork buns with hoisen sauce and cucumbers are totally worth repeatedly going there for. The Spicy Pork Sausage with Rice Cakes was good but not as spicy as they make it out to be. It's one of the few substantial dishes they serve and worth trying but not repeatedly going back for, imho. I found the fusion of flavors interesting but the prices and the size of many of the dishes just turned me off. You will have to order 3 or more dishes per person if you want to feel like you ate something so therefore expect the tab to be at least $150 for two (tax/tip and 2-3 drinks included). Oh, and this is for lunch! Now, do not get me wrong, I am all for paying for prime ingredients and I am not looking to be super-sized, but I don't want to leave feeling hungry and like I was hit over the head to boot! Now you may be wondering, \"why 3 stars then?\" Well, because if this were just some random restaurant with none of the hype and outrageous prices (except for the awesome buns, which are only $9 for two buns) then this place imho is worthy of three stars. But because there is such hype around it and it's so expensive, I've got to scrutinize it more. Note, when I judge how good a place is, expensive or not but especially when it's expensive and swimming in hype, I've got to judge it according to whether or not I want to repeatedly go back for more ... and for more than 2-3 items! I think much of the food is simply too small and over priced and quite frankly not *that* good. The fried shaved baby artichokes, for example, were not only outrageously priced ($14) but it was so incredibly small (if you scooped it all up into one ball, it would amount to maybe 1 or 2 mouthfuls) and more expensive than the large and meaty pork buns! Whuh?! Anyway, the zesty sunchoke sauce the was shmeared (yes, I said sssshmeared) around the bowl was the best part of that dish. I also didn't find the food I had all that tasty. For example, the Chilli Softshell Crab that sits atop of asparagus and a lemon confit, which I was really looking forward to eating, sadly, left me very disappointed; it was too crispy, if you can imagine such a thing! Essentially I was biting into what felt like rocks (perhaps there was just too much batter or something). Anyway, I just couldn't taste anything crab-like: no crab guts, no crab juice, nothing. But the tangy lemon confit was good!If you want to eat in an expensive, small and fairly tight place, after having waited a while (unless you go for lunch), then go right ahead!

But it's not that the atmosphere isn't conducive to socializing. And, at least with regard to the bar connected next door, the service was incredible, almost to the point where I was wondering if these guys have anything better to do than refill your water or make sure your drinks are bottomless. I was also actually rather surprised with the price, which I was expecting to be nearly 50% more than what we paid. I don't know, maybe because I wasn't paying attention to what we were eating or how much everything was, but based on the food, the atmosphere, and location, I just assumed it would be more.

This was also pretty good though not particularly stunning (stir fried veggies can only be so stunning).For our main courses we decided to try the poached chicken with sticky rice as well as the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes. \u00a0The poached chicken was easily the most disappointing thing of all. \u00a0Yes, the chicken was extremely tender but apparently poached meant brined and cooked sous vide (not that there's anything wrong with that) but totally flavorless. \u00a0Ditto with the sticky rice wrapped around it the chicken breast-where was the flavor? \u00a0I thought perhaps the flavor would be in the sauce the chicken and rice roll (think california roll-chicken on the inside, rolled inside of sticky rice) was sitting in, but the sauce was probably the most disappointing thing I've ever had at a restaurant. \u00a0Someone else here complained of there being coconut milk in theirs-well, there was no coconut milk in mine that I could taste but I wish there was, perhaps that would have imparted a Malay or Thai vibe to it but instead I got a very thin and flavorless butter/lemon based sauce. \u00a0My date was equally disappointed in this dish.Next came the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes, and being momofuku spicy meant a sriracha type spiciness. \u00a0I'll say that it was pretty decent and enjoyable to eat-nothing mindblowing, but delicious. \u00a0The sausage more or less tasted like sweet italian sausage, the rice cakes were of the extra soft, somewhat thinner, variety (soft and easy to chew), and then there was basically a crapload of sriracha and something added to make the sauce somewhat creamier and perhaps to cut the heat a little. \u00a0Perhaps a dairy product? \u00a0Nonetheless, it was still very spicy and in addition to the sriracha there were hot peppers tossed in. \u00a0Overall, a much nicer dish than the chicken dish but it wasn't amazing.Next to us sat a couple of regulars who asked what we thought-we admitted that we were disappointed in the dish and they agreed that the food just didn't seem to be \"as good as it used to be\" and though they loved the spicy sausage and rice cakes dish they thought it was just a little bit too hot to order. \u00a0I don't mind eating spicy dishes so the heat didn't bother me quite that much but I will say that if you're not an actual fan of spicy dishes avoid it because it is quite hot. \u00a0Suggestion for even fans spicy food? \u00a0Get them to bring out the spicy sausage and rice cakes *before* the blander dishes. \u00a0I think that we wouldn't have minded the ultra bland chicken if they had simply brought it after our mouths were on fire from the sausage since it'd have helped to cool off the palate, but then again that may have simply made the contrast too great between the relatively flavorful sauce and rice cakes and the depressingly bland chicken dish.Overall I'd rate the dishes as follows:Pork buns-5/5Chicken with sticky rice 1/5 (seriously disappointing)Sausage with rice cakes-4/5Rhubarb side dish-4/5So why is the overall rating going to be a 3/5 and not a 4/5? \u00a0Momofuku Ssam scored about a 2/5 on value, with our tab for 2 coming out to $115. \u00a0This included two glasses of wine for my date and a $8 beer for myself, but we couldn't quite escape the feeling that we'd had better food for a lot cheaper before. \u00a0It's not that I mind high prices if it's really something special (we've had $200 a person at dinners before) but this just didn't seem worth it.

We ordered the pork belly buns, the bbq rib sandwich, the beef tendon, and the spicy sausage with rice cakes. My favorite were the bbq rib sandwiches, absolutely declicious with tangy bbq sauce, moist and tender rib meat, and great balance of flavor with the addition of fresh coleslaw. The pork buns were good, dripping with belly jus and tasted great with the chili sauce. The beef tendon was probably the weakest dish.....could use a bit more spice and for $16, you could get 5x as much from Chinatown with better quality tendon and more flavor.
