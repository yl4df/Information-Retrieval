Just kidding, you can't make too many visits here. Anyway, time for an update!Bachi Burger is a fantastic burger place that I always recommend to friends and family, locals and visitors alike. The specialty burgers are obviously what you want to get, but don't turn a blind eye to appetizers and fries.I've enjoyed the kurobuta and aribaki sausage w/ honey mustard, chili fried chicken, oxtail chili cheese fries, and the sweet potato fries before. However, my favorite side is definitely the truffle parmesan fries with parmigiano reggiano, white truffle oil (shut up, I know it's not real truffle), porcini cream, and sundried tomato aioli. I don't tend to have it while I'm in the middle of a Bachi burger, so I usually try to get them to bring it out earlier than the burgers.I will detail all the burgers that I've eaten in reverse power rankings style:7) \"Banh-mi\" Burger. Brownie points for the quotation marks. I always enjoy a good banh mi, but I am not a fan of this burger, and it still saddens me that this is the one that they chose to feature on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. The flavors just don't work or harmonize together for some reason, and I always steer people away from this.6) Mr. Ho's. The highlight is probably lup cheong, a sweet pinkish red pork sausage. The problem is that the overall flavor profile is too sweet and only has that one flavor. Glad I've tried it, glad I'll never have to order it again.5) Spicy miso. I had this tied with Kiki's before, but I've gotta make a choice. Nothing especially wrong here, and really love the fried egg. Heat seekers, do know that the sauce isn't that spicy, even for someone with a delicate palate like me. If I had a rotation, this would make my rotation.4) Kiki's. My old second favorite burger. Bacon, lots of mushrooms, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli. Sweet overall but not too sweet, and a good layering of flavors.3) Miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu. Relatively simple combination here to accompany the default \"wagyu\" patty. Chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, and crispy onion rings. It's really weird though, since I specifically taking a bite, not enjoying it, then flipping my burger upside down and really loving it. I guess the flavors hit my mouth a lot better that way. Try it both ways and see for yourself.By the way, I couldn't really distinguish wagyu from the normal angus beef, so you're likely better off not \"upgrading\" any of your other specialty burgers.2) Manga. My burger from today. This was a special posted on the chalkboard outside. It is a 7 oz patty with sunny side up egg (presented without top bun not layered), sprouts, crab and scallop dynamite, and a side of pickled ginger. Apparently, enoki mushrooms also were in it, but I don't recall. Anyway, if you're a fan of dynamite, you need to eat this. The egg contributes as usual, the dynamite flavor is all there (most tender baby scallops I've ever had, by the way), the beef flavor is always there, and the pickled ginger can add extra sweetness if you so desire. I couldn't decide whether I enjoy it more with or without ginger.1) Ronin. Still my favorite, although the manga made a really, really strong case. I think the yuzu citrus aioli adds enough acidity that it pushes the Ronin above a very strong field of contenders. Caramelized onions, Japanese coleslaw, miso goma dressing, and my beloved fried egg complete the flavor combination.All burgers really should be enjoyed medium-rare. It's cooked, but you still get that nice pinkish center and keep all the juiciness. If you order it well-done, I will personally hunt you down and even haunt your dreams if I must. They have always delivered the right temperature and never gotten me sick, so don't under or over-order.Some don't believe that it's the best burger in town. I haven't eaten everywhere in Vegas yet, but this is still my favorite place, even in spite of the recent menu-wide price hike. I will also note that some guy who writes a blog solely about Vegas burgers has apparently been almost everywhere, and he's named Bachi as his favorite. You will have to see for yourself, and I hope you manage to go early or late enough to avoid the ubiquitous crowds.", "Date": "2014-07-23", "Author_Location": "Henderson, NV"}, {"Author": "Momo B.", "ReviewID": "2jUYAyEAdU0NV8aq2ecqvA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BURGER LUVI've been coming here since Lorin Watada opened Bachi Burger, and I haven't discovered anyone else who can come close to replicating Bachi Burger.

I've tried a few of the burgers. My favorite is the kalbi burger. I love the marinade and the kimchee and spicy mayo they use. I could smell this marinated beef patty from outside. In loooove with the oxtail chili cheese fries! Every time I bring someone here, that's a hit. Went one time and finally got to try the pork belly buns, but unfortunately the pork belly was cold when we got it, kind of congealed already. My family eats a lot of pork belly and being Chinese, I'm familiar with similar dishes. My friend and I were highly disappointed. I love their strawberry jasmine lemonade! So good ESP in the LV heat. Never seen the combo anywhere else. They also opened a ramen house next door. You can order from both menus. I'll be back to try the ramen (but probably not until the winter) and to give those pork belly buns another try.", "Date": "2014-07-19", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Chris F.", "ReviewID": "-Z1AyUovd_GBxfNDT_9crw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Hype is real!

The fried egg on top of fries is definitely amazing.The burgers are hit and miss:Ronin burger - reminded me of eating sushi rolls in a burger. Tons of great miso glaze, a fried egg, carmelized onion, multiple BBQ and other glazes. Delish. Worth $11.Kiki burger - great use of 3 types of asian mushrooms, grueye cheese and sauce. Worth $11.Miyagi-san grass fed Wagyu burger - very average. Didn't taste amazing. Tasted like a regular burger. Not worth $14.Shogun burger - wagyu beef with foie gras. Didn't taste anything special at all. Definitely not worth $26, even with asian pear, miso butter and asian peaches inside. Skip it.3.5 stars overall.

We went for to Bachi Burger during the lunch rush house madness however I only waited about less than 10 minutes to get seated. I went ahead and ordered for my bf as he always gets a usual burger (ketchup and mustard only) regardless of where he is eating. I ordered a protein style medium well with avocado burger. I would hands down say this has been the best protein burger I've ever had. I was a bit skeptical about order a protein burger as I didn't not maybe reviews on me. But I was definitely not disappointed. Great Asian infused flavor. I also ordered the aioli fries and he got regular fries. bomb.com !My bf was very satisfied with his \"plain\" burger, and he's definitely the pickier one. He always a says that a \"good burger doesn't need so many ingredients\". He even filled out the survey! Overall great place. It might be a bit more pricier, but you get what you pay for!

I really enjoyed my meal here last night with friends. They had two menus available for us to chose from: Bachi Burger and Shoku Ramen. I'm assuming that the Shoku Ramen place (next door) shared the same owners as Bachi Burger, which is why they had two different menus. ATMOSPHEREDarkened lighting created an intimate atmosphere for friends and couples. Wood paneled walls and skylights made the space feel laid-back and upscale. I was definitely comfortable! It was busy and the tables are spaced far apart from each other so that you have lots of space to have private conversations and can talk loudly without bothering others.FOODAlcohol, Japanese appetizers & Ramen offered from next door's kitchen, and Asian-fusion fries and burgers were on the menu. They have a great selection and there are many choices of burgers for all types of appetites. Because I am a vegetarian who eats seafood, there were options from both menus for me! I also liked that they have the option of add-ins and an ample selection of sauces to accompany the yummy fries. Now onto mine and my boyfriend's selections:1. TAKOYAKI (FRIED OCTOPUS BALLS) $8.00Delicious! I love that their takoyaki had 6 bites containing lots of flavor, and generous toppings (bonito flakes, ginger, mayo, takoyaki sauce, etc). Could have been crispier on the outside, but the inside was cooked and had a good bite-sized amount of octopus (tako).2. NO MEAT HERE BURGER (WITH ADDED SWISS CHEESE) $11.50Had fried eggplant, shiitake mushroom patty, tomatoes, onions, a perfect soft bun and mixed greens. I think it had some sauce in there as well, and combined with the swiss cheese... You think being vegetarian is a curse? No. This burger is a blessing. If I wasn't vegetarian, I would've have tried it. So THANKS BACHI FOR MAKING ME NOT REGRET MY DECISIONS! Arigato gozaimasu!3. VEGETARIAN MISO RAMEN (WITH ADDED BOK CHOY) $11.50Good ramen, good (on the sweet-side) miso flavor. I don't know what their regular ramen broth tastes like, but I'm sure it's equally as good. It is missing a bit of a wow-factor though. But points for having vegetarian choices.SERVICEVery understanding and patient server. My friend is one of those people that asks you lots of questions and takes awhile to order. Our guy server (with curly hair I think?) was patient, and explained everything perfectly. He even brought us our somewhat difficult water order, as we all wanted it \"hot\", \"iced' and \"room temperature\". I know, the customers we all dislike. But hey, we were accommodated with a smile, so brownie points for putting up with us! Also, more tip for you, sir!Overall, good night. A little pricey for burgers, but they are well executed and delicious so no complaints here.

I'm quite sure this opinion is not going to be terribly popular and I will definitely be in the minority, but I just wasn't all that impressed. Allow me to explain. We were thinking it wouldn't be that busy at 2:30 on a Monday, but that was way off base. This place was slammed! A far cry from my last experience, we were warmly greeted by the hostess almost instantly! Already off to a better start! We were quoted 3 minutes for the bar, but after 5 we were escorted to a table! Nice!We got our waters right \u00a0away and went through the menu. After a few moments our waiter came by and took our orders. I opted for the Ronin burger ($12), while my friend tried the Miso burger($11.50) and we decided to split an order of the parmesan truffle fries($5.50).Now it did take about 15-20 minutes to get our food, but since they were so busy, it was understandable. The service here was like night and day from last time! Our drinks were refilled without having to ask anyone. The hostess, the waiter, and every other employee was very friendly despite it being pretty busy. Well, the food finally arrives and...well..it was ...okay. I mean, I just wasn't blown away like all these other people apparently were. I'm not saying it's bad. Actually it's not at all. I just don't think it's for me. My ronin burger was sweet, the patty was nice and juicy, but there was too much BBQ sauce on it , which made it pretty messy. I don't know. I just wasn't feeling it. Not only that, I had to go home and make myself a sandwich as the meal here just wasn't very filling at all.The truffle fries were very yummy and very tasty! We did thoroughly enjoy those! They are served with a side of honey mustard, I believe.I am glad that I was finally able to experience the famed Bachi Burger, but honestly, I just wasn't impressed enough to warrant a return visit.

It is made up of angus beef, caramelized onions, fried egg, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, katsu BBQ, and yuzu citrus aioli. So simple, but so good.Shogun burger: The burger consisted of waygu beef & unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached asian pear, miso butter, and yamamomo peach. There were so many flavors going on in my mouth, it's hard to describe the taste. Is it worth $25? Probably not. Is it worth a try? Definitely yes.Miyagi-san burger: Another waygu beef burger. Also comes with fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon, onion rings, and chili mayo. Great tasting burger. I liked how it was not messy, even though it had so much going on in it.Kiki's burger: The most recent burger I tried. This is Bachi's version of a mushroom burger. It's made of angus beef, sauteed shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrroms. There's also caramelized bacon and gruyere cheese. Sauce: garlic chili aioli and sweet onion marmalade. I like it. If you're feeling extra fatty, get the oxtail chili cheese fries. Pretty heavy. But SO good and savory. Get it to share!They also serve ramen here at Bachi. I've tried one of their bowls before but it was not memorable. I don't even remember the name of it. It was bad, but it wasn't great. Just stick with the burgers.p.s.

We needed to head back to OC sooner than that on a Sunday evening, so unfortunately we didn't get to try it out until Cinco de Mayo/Fight Night weekend 2014. We went straight there upon arrival in Vegas around 10PM-11PM. My boyfriend was certain he spotted professional boxer Mickey Bey enjoying a post-fight burger...A couple of us ordered Hitachino beers imported from Japan. At $9 each, I could have done without it since the burger was actually pretty filling. But when in Rome/Vegas, right? The Real Ginger Brew was light and refreshing, but not the most outstanding ginger beer I've ever had. I'm just glad that it was 8% ABV.My boyfriend ordered Sweet Potato Fries $4.50 done Truffle Parmesean style for an extra $1. It was seasoned with sea salt and came with yuzu citrus aioli. He definitely couldn't finish them, so if you are very hungry it is a good value for an appetizer.He also ordered the Banh-Mi Burger $11, a Vietnamese-style burger. It definitely tasted the way a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich would taste in delicious, beefy, burger form.I ordered the Kiki's Burger $11 with a fried egg for an additional $1.50. I was very satisfied with this burger because it was a spicy and sweet tastebud party, but I could have done without the egg. Our server was talking it up, I feel like maybe he was just upselling me on the beer and the egg (tips for higher tax/tips haha). There was plenty of bacon, but of course I saved it for my last bite. I would definitely order this burger again, sans fried egg.The buns at Bachi Burger are extremely fluffy, but once you start eating it will flatten out.

I went with two other friends, both foodies as well, both love burgers too! Again, the wait for this place was long, 25 min. but worth the wait. I've found the trend that long lines, means good food :)The three of us decided to each get a burger and share. The ones we decided on were the Shogun Burger, Kiki's Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. We started out meal out with two tasty appetizers in the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns. Both were Amazing! Great start to our delicious meal.The first burger was the Shogun burger...$25. Yes, pretty pricey...But we went all out as foodies! This burger was so mouthwatering and delicious I could not believe all the flavors coming out in the first bite! The Wagyu Beef & Unagi was so soft and just melted in your mouth as the buttery miso helped smooth it out even more. There was a sweetness that hit me as well, not knowing what it was at first, I quickly recalled it being the peach and pear. Best tasting gourmet burger I have ever had!Kiki's Burger was a delight as well! I have to say all the burgers were soft and tender and mouthwatering. Just the flavors varied depending on the ingredients...which were high quality. The last on was the Spicy Miso Burger. And of course I enjoyed this one as well because of the spice, still not that spicy, but had a kick to it. And of course the fried egg and garlic making a great taste combination.Would highly recommend for burger lovers. The flavors of the burgers are Asian inspired, and work very well.

I've had dreams about this place, and the withdrawal levels are running high, at this point.My wife and I used to live pretty close to the Windmill location, and we frequented this location about a dozen times. We've tried a number of the burgers there, as well as the oxtail chili cheese fries ($11.50) as an appetizer. These oxtail chili cheese fries are amazing. They have garlic aioli and a fried egg on top of fries with oxtail pieces on top of it... incredibly tasty, even if you aren't traditionally an oxtail fan.With regards to burgers, my personal favorite has always been the Kiki's Burger ($10.00). I recommend this burger if you are a big mushroom fan. This burger is packed with saut\u00e9ed shiitake, enoki and eryngii mushrooms in it with caramelized bacon, a sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, with a garlic aioli spread. One of the unheralded parts of their burgers is the amazing bun that they use for the burger. It is toasted just perfectly, and it complements everything in between the buns. The patty is always cooked and seasoned so well. Extremely juicy, and it blends perfectly with the mushrooms, cheese, garlic aioli and the rest of the amazing ingredients. The Kiki's burger is to die for.A lot of other people also love the Ronin Burger ($10.00) because it has a fried egg in it, along with caramelized onions, some sort of Japanes cole slaw, and a Yuzu citrus aioli. This is the one that my wife and my cousin always order and they absolutely love it. This one gets a little messy though because of the egg, but it's all a part of the experience. For side dishes, I always recommend either the Truffle Parmesan Fries ($4.00) or the Sweet Potato Fries ($4.50). Both are served with an aioli dipping sauce. It is a generous portion of fries served in a large cone shaped serving container, and 1 order is more than enough to share among 2-3 people, unless you are a beast when it comes to fries, and can finish the entire order by yourself!I don't really have any complaints about Bachi Burger, other than the fact that the wait can be a little long, but when it's worth the wait, it doesn't matter how long the wait is! I've waited an hour before, and it made us savor the meal that much more! The only other thing that I wouldn't recommend are the boba drinks that they serve. Just wait to get a real boba drink from Chinatown after you have finished your burger. I wasn't too thrilled about the taro boba I tried once, so I never ordered it again. Other than that, everything else is flawless. We can't wait to get back to Vegas so that we can visit one of the two Bachi Burger locations. I don't rate very many places 5-star at all (check out my reviews), so when I give something a 5-star rating, I am not joking around.

My first impression was good, Bachi Burger seemed like an asian infused burger place that knew how to do things right. The only problem I had with this place was service.There was a 20 minute wait in which we said bar or table was okay. After 15 minutes in, the hostess calls the table before us and asked if they wanted to do bar. They said no, and so I went up to ask if we could take the bar seating instead since we were next anyways. The lady says, \"sorry, the bar isn't open seating.\" Umm.. what? The first hostess said that if there was available bar seating she would let us know and seat us. So we were like okay.... I guess. We waited another 10 minutes (she seats a big party of 5 in the meantime) and then calls my name and asks if we were okay with bar seating. Seriously? You rejected us 10 minutes ago.. and then you ask us if we wanted it after? What a waste of time and space. It's just been empty sitting there the whole time.. By this time I was super hangry and unhappy at her, so I just stalked to the bar and sat. Our guy server at the bar was nice, but was extremely slow. We had to flag down multiple servers and busboys to get our check, and paying for the food was a really long process. For this place being busy all the time, you would think their service should be up to par and they should be running efficiently. But it's not... I would typically minus one for service, but this was at two points (hostess and waitress) where it was lacking...Anyways on to the food- which was absolutely delicious.Salt and pepper fries- they were okay, I really wanted the oxtail fries but I don't think the two of us could stomach that and a burger.

His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7 \u00a01/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening \u00a02 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. yelp.com/biz_photos/bach\u2026 Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese \"ban-mi\" sandwich. \u00a0The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally. \u00a0We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:- Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings. \u00a0There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. yelp.com/biz_photos/bach\u2026 - Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. yelp.com/biz_photos/bach\u2026 - Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly. \u00a0The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. yelp.com/biz_photos/bach\u2026 The restaurant's name, \"Bachi,\" takes on a dual meaning: \u00a0a shortened version of the word \"hibachi\" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the d\u00e9cor an industrial look.

The burger has delicious Wagyu beef and unagi (marinated eel), pan-seared foie gras, miso butter, and poached Asian pear.

I decided on Bachi. \u00a0I HAVE NO REGRETS!! \u00a0Although, to be honest, I did also end up going to Ramsey a few days later... Ramsey was nothing special, and definitely paled in comparison to Bachi. \u00a0But this is a review for Bachi, not Ramsey, so my apologies, I digress. \u00a0BACK TO BACHI!!My friend and I went there Friday night, shortly after I arrived in Vegas. \u00a0I would say we got to Bachi close to around 745pm. \u00a0It's located in a medium-sized shopping plaza off the strip of Vegas. \u00a0Nothing about this plaza screams out that they are hiding the treasure trove that is Bachi.There was already a good amount of ppl waiting outside Bachi at the time we got there; \u00a0when we asked to put our names on the wait-list, we were told that there would be a wait of around 30 minutes. \u00a0The inside of the restaurant is pretty big, they have a quite a few tables and lots of TVs hanging around... very modern and trendy. \u00a0They also have a bar area that was pretty empty, my friend and I just decided to sit at the bar. \u00a0I was hungry from my drive, and I wanted to eat!After perusing the menu, I decided to go for the MIYAGI BURGER, along with an order of TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES. \u00a0My friend wanted to eat a little lighter so he ordered the Sausage appetizers and a Salad.... whatever, he's weird.The restaurant was busy, so my food did take a while to come out... I think it was around 30 minutes or so until I got my food, but ohhhhh boy was it worth the wait!!The Miyagi Burger was just gorgeous... everything was stacked neatly onto each other. \u00a0It looks like one of those burgers that you would see on a TV commercial.When I took my first bite, I felt like I was in heaven. \u00a0The bun was nice and fluffy, and the wagyu patty was oh so juicy and oh so perfectly cooked. \u00a0Yes, I am a huge fan of bacon (what guy isn't?), but for some reason... I am not a fan of bacon in my burger. \u00a0Not the case here! \u00a0All the ingredients here, especially the caramelized bacon and the fried egg, worked so well with the burger. \u00a0Nothing was overpowering... everything just served as a perfect complement to accentuate the wonderful taste of the Miyagi burger as a whole.The burger was a good-size, but I managed to finish the entire thing in about 5 minutes... maybe even less! \u00a0The only time I stopped was so I could take a few breathes, and tell my friend how delicious the burger was. \u00a0By the time I finished the burger, my plate was a mess from all the juices that had seeped out... but none of the juices got onto my clothes, so no biggie.The truffle fries were really good too. \u00a0Not too oily, not too salty, the dipping sauces were good, although I didn't find them necessary. \u00a0What distinguished these truffle fries from other truffle fries I had was the brown sauce that was layered on. I'm not sure exactly what the brown sauce was... I thought it was gravy, but gravy isn't listed as one of the ingredients on the menu, so maybe it was the black truffle porcini cream...? \u00a0Either way, the brown sauce was soooooo good, I just wish the fries came with more of that brown sauce.The place isn't cheap... ended up paying around $20 for just the burger and fries, but well worth it. \u00a0I can honestly say that the Miyagi burger was the best I've ever had, and the truffle fries are definitely no joke.Definitely coming back to try their other items!!! \u00a0BACHI BURGER ROCKS!!", "Date": "2014-05-06", "Author_Location": "Arcadia, CA"}, {"Author": "Shirin L.", "ReviewID": "3AkooIMoIuqzIwUorMSuNg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome Burgers!", "Date": "2014-07-05", "Author_Location": "Henderson, NV"}, {"Author": "Andy K.", "ReviewID": "9FI3o6AgqEfTVjr3WkCTdg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bachi Burger is a staple in bringing flavor and culture in Las Vegas...This was a to-go order that consisted of the Miyagi burger and the infamous oxtail chili fries...Miyagi Burger: teriyaki glazed medium rare grass fed wagyu beef, chili mayo, \u00a0fried egg, furikake (seasoning you put on rice), bacon, and crispy onion strings...plenty of flavor in this burger...you have the sweet, salty, and savory...excellentoOxtail Chili Cheese Fries: honestly I have 5 stars in this review when I really mean for it to be 4.5...The reason why are the fries...it probably has everything to do with me taking a to-go order however the fries weren't as dank as the other times I had them...since it was a to-go order they separated the chili in a different container from the fries, jalape\u00f1os, cheese, fried egg, and cilantro. ..The fries for some reason were dry and hard...The chili is great as usual...very sweet and savory...These fries definitely taste better if you have them at the location...I forgot to mention the order size seemed smaller than usualAll in all if you never been to Bachi Burger I recommend trying it at least once...I know fusion cuisine ain't for everybody but for the majority, it is..", "Date": "2014-05-24", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Abigail P.", "ReviewID": "CHHGGlBLP1jRU6K5wPiVHg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The food here was absolutely delicious.

In fact, many food critics say \"Bachi Burger\" might just be the best gourmet burger spot in Vegas (which is a pretty bold statement considering all the burger joints on the Strip backed by famous chefs). Burger \"connoisseurs\" unwilling to experiment any further than some avocado or pepper jack, however, might be scared off by this menu. For instance, the Ronin Burger features Angus beef, carmelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso-Goma dressing, fried egg, Katsu BBQ, and Yuzu citrus aioli. The Banh-Mi Burger includes Angus beef, pork, shrimp, lemongrass pork pate, fresh herbs, curry aioli, pickled vegetables, and Nuoc Mam sauce.Don't be intimidated, though -- there are other options for those with simpler tastes and you can always build your own burger by starting off with an Angus patty or Wagyu patty and adding ingredients from there. Fried onion rings, applewood bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, etc can all be added to any patty for $1.50 each.There are also a variety of different sandwiches to choose from and I could honestly fill up on the fries alone. The oxtail chili cheese fries with garlic aioli and fried egg are extremely popular, but the more traditional fries are also a big hit -- mainly because of the savory sauces that accompany them. The garlic chili aioli, Yuzu citrus aioli, sundried tomato aioli and pineapple ketchup are all HIGHLY recommended for dipping or drowning the fries of your choice (the options are regular, garlic, sweet potato, and truffle Parmesan).If you're not much of an adventurous diner, you'll probably stay away from Bachi Burger.

The sweet potato fries are the best among the fries choices but the dipping sauce it comes with is gross. Way too sweet and strong of a taste, not complimenting it at all.

The restaurant is on the small side, very casual, and filled with tons of modern angry panda art. Their menu covers a huge variety of Asian cultures and flavors in a fusion format combined with classic American burger options such as bacon and fried onions. Generally sweeter than salty.

I've never been to a restaurant where they've done that and it seems strange.

I'll still come here again, but it isn't the best I've ever had. I ordered the oxtail fries with my family. This dish was the restaurant's saving grace for me. These fries were crisp and the chili was tasty and meaty! Sooooo incredibly good, but fries aren't supposed to be what makes a burger place. I got the Kalbi Burger. I ordered my kimchi on the side since I wanted to avoid it overpowering my burger. I'm glad I did because that kimchi was disappointing to me. Their kimchi is too sweet in my opinion, not up my alley. The burger was alright. I really liked the soft bun, but the patty was just okaye. What I was impressed with were the size of the burgers, since all the pictures make the burgers look smaller than they really are. I was really full after I finished, but it was just an okay burger to me. Maybe everything just didn't come together for me because in writing this review, I feel like the burger sounds special and promising, but that's not really what I was left feeling.The service was nice though!

What we got was barely-there shredded oxtail meat in a stew of chili smothered over fries and topped with an egg. The chili was good for what it was but the oxtail meat did not shine.The Miyagi-San burger was very flavorful. I liked it an would probably get it again. The Shogun burger had interesting and complex flavors. I don't think any one thing really shined. I could've have done without the poached pear. It sounded good on paper but it was just over-kill. The meat patty had a sweet teriyaki sauce and that was plenty sweet on its own. The frois gras was an interesting touch but it had the same texture of the poached pear. I'm not sure how frois gras is traditionally cooked but I would've wished mine was cooked a little more firm and salted more to counter the sweetness. I honestly think the burger was a whole lot of \"too much\". Frois gras... Unagi... Poached pear... Wagyu beef patties... All wonderful on its own and maybe it should be enjoyed that way.

So on my way back home we drove by this place to give it a try. \u00a0We got here right as it opened, so there was no line to deal with.A friendly and enthusiastic staff member greeted us and sat us down. He asked if we had ever been to Bachi Burger and when we said no, he did a quick introduction of some of the more popular items on the menu.There were three of us and we got the following:Truffle Parmesan Fries: ($5.50) which included \u00a0Parmesan Reggiano, \u00a0black truffle cream with sun-dried tomato aioli on the side. \u00a0- I thought it was decent. I didn't really taste the truffle flavor as much as I hoped for, and I preferred my fries to be a bit crispier. \u00a0I would probably pass on getting this the next time.BBQ Bachi Burger: ($13.00) \u00a08 oz Grass Fed Wagyu, lettuce, tomato and onion. - This is the burger to get if you want a simple, juicy and flavorful burger where you let the bun and the meat shine. My friend enjoyed it thoroughly and didn't see the need for extra toppings or sauces. Black & Green Burger: ($14:00) American Wagyu Grass Fed Beef, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, spinach, bacon, Point Reyes blue cheese,roasted garlic - No doubt this is a flavorful burger, just reading the ingredients makes you salivate. \u00a0My friend liked the burger and the combination of flavors. He said he would get it again.Shogun burger: \u00a0($26.00): Wagyu Beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, poached Asian pear, miso butter, and a Yamamomo Peach palette cleanser.- I got the ultimate flavorful and tasty burger I have ever tasted. Over indulgent, perhaps. \u00a0However, the flavors surprisingly work well together.Granted I was in search of foie gras coming from California which has now banned the delectable item so it was a no brainer that I chose this burger when I saw it on the menu.It is a very rich tasty burger and slightly oily, but that is a given. The foie gras was pan seared so it was soft and melted slightly over the beef so there was a lot of texture going on with the poached pear. Our waiter came to check on us after our food was delivered and told me that I should have the \"Yamamomo Peach\" before I eat the burger as it is a palette cleanser to prepare your tastebuds from all the flavors before you bit into the burger. Just remember that there is a small pit in the marinated peach.I can see that the Shogun burger is not for everyone, but I enjoyed every bite of this burger. \u00a0The menu if fairly extensive and has a little bit of something for everyone. Our server mentioned they plan to open a Bachi Burger near UCLA soon and another place called Healthy Life Kitchen.Why 4 out of 5 stars? Well, I was a bit disappointed with the truffle fries. Service was fine. Parking is plentiful. Prices are higher but I suppose you get what you pay for. I would definitely come here again if I was ever in Vegas. \u00a0p.s.

Bachi Burger isn't, but that's ok. As stated before, the food here is good. I started with the Oxtail Chili Fries. I love the addition of the sunny side up egg. I know, everything nowadays comes with a runny egg on top, but it really works here. The rich yolk plays well with the chili, that is a bit on the sweet side. The thinly sliced chiles add just the right amount of heat. The oxtail is nice and tender, perfectly cooked. The downside of the dish was the sweetness of the chili, but overall very good. I had the Pork Belly Steamed Buns based on several yelp reviews. I've made a similar dish at home and wanted to compare. These were nothing special, maybe a bit underseasoned, but again.... good. I really liked the dipping sauce, kind of a miso BBQ sauce. I'll stick to mine. The service was excellent and friendly. Warning: My friend ordered his burger well done and the server told him it would take 25-30 minutes for his burger. I thought that was weird, but oh well. P.S. This is really a 2-1/2 Star review, and I will be back again to explore the menu a bit in hopes that I'll find that one \"wow\" item I'm looking for...", "Date": "2014-03-23", "Author_Location": "La Habra, CA"}, {"Author": "Vivian S.", "ReviewID": "N7MxYtiQiyiCuxPxpnvIFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AWESOME find. \u00a0One of those, \u00a0how did we get there?

However, this doesn't affect my review; more seats would have been nice.We were seated in and everything was so loud and fast-paced. Our server wasn't very good at listening to our orders however, but it was probably due to the loud noises (even though we practically yelled our orders). The server was also a bit irritating because when one of us wanted to get the burger cooked well-done, she asked if we wanted all the orders to come together since preparing a burger well-done would take a while and we said it was fine but she insisted on bringing the orders out as soon as they're done. We had to reassure her like 3 times that we wanted them out at the same time.

Burger joints in Vegas are a dime a dozen, so I was a little skeptical at first about driving off strip to grab a burger. It turns out that Bachi Burger served up one of the best burgers i've EVER had.The restaurant has two locations in Las Vegas, both of which are off the strip. This means you need to access to a car (be it rental or taxi) in order to get here. This Bachi Burger is located in a random plaza 10 minutes away from the main Las Vegas Strip.My buddies and I each ordered a burger. We also shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries ($5) and Pork Belly Steamed Buns ($10). To be honest, the tastiness of my burger overshadowed the appetizers. The truffle fries were good, but not great. Maybe i'm just not accustomed to the taste of truffle, especially when paired with fries. I thought the combination was a little too salty. Even with the truffle sauce, I was still craving ketchup. The fries are barely big enough to share between two people. I would opt for the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries next time. The Pork Belly Steamed Buns were good. Three buns come in one order. The pork was soft and juicy. I appreciate the use of radish to add crunch and texture to an otherwise \"soft\" dish. However, I still prefer cucumber over radish in this dish. For this reason, I favor Momofuku's version. I also believe they used excessive Hoisin sauce, which masked the intrinsic flavor of the pork belly. The Spicy Miso Burger was the real shining star of the meal. I never guessed that miso would go so well with a burger, but it does! The subtle sweetness and saltiness pairs well with the Angus Beef. The additional flavors from the runny fried egg and mild heat from the shishito peppers make this burger exceptional.

Wait time: 25-30 minutes. Though medium-to-large groups lingered in and around the restaurant, these groups were diminishing at a pretty impressive pace. Names were being called from left to right. It didn't take long until the hostess finally said what I've been yearning to hear for the past half hour...\"Rachel.\"Once seated, the menus eagerly flipped open and the bf and I were enticed to such great heights. The selection of starters and burgers were bountiful but after careful consideration the lucky winners went as followed:Ox-tail chili cheese fries:This appetizer should be a REQUIREMENT when dining here. A large, hot plate stacked with crispy thin fries immersed in generous amounts of salty and savory chili, shredded ox-tail AND crowned with a perfectly fried egg--tell me what's not to like? This portion is perfect for 2 adults with a tenacious appetite.Kiki burger (my choice):I knew this burger was calling to me when I first read caramelized bacon and sweet onion marmalade. The words 'caramelized' and 'sweet' being the major deal breakers. Unfortunately, that's where the courtship between Kiki and I comes to an end. Though the meat patty excelled in juiciness and the bacon maintained its candied glaze, it fell short elsewhere. I was underwhelmed by the not-so-sweet-non-existent-taste-of-onion marmalade and the slight bitterness of the greens. But it wasn't a total fail for my appetite. Like a short-lived romance with an ex--we shared some good moments and also some bad--but in the end, I never really saw any great potential. Kiki just wasn't meant for me.Ronin burger (the bf's choice):Any burger with a fried egg is pretty much en route to the bf's belly. There's no way he's going to let it slip on by. The only problem with this burger was that it was HIS and not mine. We cut both our burgers in half and traded so we could sample each others but deep-down inside as soon as I sunk my teeth into this burger I was hooked. Ronin grabbed a hold of my taste buds and never wanted to let go. It was love at first bite. So many wonderful things were happening in my mouth that made it nearly impossible to ingest. An orchestra of flavors and textures that was beautifully executing a rhapsody. I wanted to salvage the juiciness of the meat, the sweetness of the caramelized onions, the tang and crunch of the coleslaw and even the saltiness of the fried egg. Bravo Ronin. Bravo!If my experience doesn't make you want to feed the beast then you're completely and utterly missing out. Bachi Burger is a MUST try when in Vegas.

I've heard good things about bachi burgers and the pictures have always made me drool. Finally we got to try it and I wasn't disappointed!I'm not sure why so many people had such bad service, but we must've came on a good night. The service was great for us and the guy was really funny. Truffle Parmesan Fries - Definitely loaded w/ black truffle flavor! It was enough to share between the 4 of us. Nice and crispy, not oily at allOxtail Chili Cheese Fries - Their most popular item, presented beautifully! The over easy egg on top made everything delicious. Again, fries were cooked perfectly crispy, but I do wish they added more oxtail. Not that the fries were bad, but I actually prefer the truffle fries.Shogun Burger - $25 for a burger?! My bf ordered this and I got to steal 1/4 of it. It sounded like the ultimate most delicious burger ever w/ all the ingredients listed: wagyu beef, unagi, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, peach YUMM. Unfortunately though the flavors were all lost in translation to me. The only thing I could taste the whole time was the unagi...This burger isn't worth $25 imoKiki burger - I love shrooms! (I know it's vegas, but I'm talking about food here people not the other kind of shroom lol) There were 3 kinds of mushrooms in this burger: shiitake, enoki, and eryngii. Instead of angus beef, I paid extra to get the wagyu beef patty. The caramelized bacon and mushrooms made the burger stand out. This was my 2nd favorite burgerMiyagi-San Grass Fed Wagyu Burger - My 2nd favorite burger!! Again, that fried egg w/ the oozing yolk made this burger taste its best. The crispy onions & furikake added the extra oomph to it. For first timers I would recommend getting this to start!Spicy Miso burger - It's not spicy at all. The burger wasn't bad, but flavors didn't pop or stand out compared to Kiki & Miyagi-San.The patties here were all requested to be cooked medium rare and they came out good/juicy. I really like the taiwanese sweet buns here which makes the burgers unique. However, after trying Gordon Ramsay's BurGR in PH, I believe the burgers there are a lot better.

Food came out past the 1.5 hour mark and my wife's burger was medium rare instead of well done and they heated it up instead of a new one due to time. By then, my wife was not happy, the burger fell apart and was not tasty. She ate a bite and took the kids and left. I waited for the check. The team at Bachi was nice to not charge for her messes up burger.

With the pork in the patty, I think it went well together.FYI furikake is a type of seasoning, usually a mix of seaweed, sesame seeds, dried and ground fish/veggies that you put on rice.", "Date": "2014-01-30", "Author_Location": "Portland, OR"}, {"Author": "Patty L.", "ReviewID": "Og-ZMps9rO8Wd7bvgon3MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a good place to eat that was not on the Strip and found this place with 4 stars and decided to give it a try.

Definitely a plate to be shared.Pork belly steamed buns $10: Very Asian tasting (good thing obviously)! The glaze on the pork belly is sweet (how it's supposed to be). Comes with three, definitely share this too!Shogun burger $26: The grand finale... The major components were wagyu beef, unagi (eel), and foie gras. There were no doubt LOTS of flavors but my bf thought it was too much. He wasn't a big fan of the unagi (but I was!). My issue with the burger was that it was way too oily. The combination of two days worth of alcohol and the greasiness of the burger (with the fries and pork belly too) was just too much for me to handle. I definitely had a stomach ache for the rest of the day - not that I'm blaming Bachi Burger. Was it worth $26? Mm I don't think so. I really like foie gras (bf is French) so putting it inside the burger was a bit of a waste to me. Though it did taste really good when I bit into it separately.Anyway, great place to try!

But the BEST burger in Nevada? I don't know about that...They have an extensive menu with lots of options but I recommend sticking to a burger and fries (or some pork belly buns for those of you who don't like burgers!). We did NOT like the oxtail chili-cheese fries or the Bachi Caesar salad we ordered. My suggestion is stick to the regular fries without all that gamey meat and what not added on top!!! & do NOT order a salad LOL I give you permission to be a fattie for this entire meal, it was one of the worst caesar salads I've had and we ended up only taking a few bites and then throwing the rest away. The pork belly steamed buns were delicious! Too bad you only get three for the price, but I actually enjoyed these more than the burgers. I thought that the burgers were good but nothing really blew my mind away. The buns were just your average buns, pretty good but nothing spectacularly soft like some people say. I think your burger experience really depends on which burger you order because all of the extra fixings they put in your burger determines what it tastes like. My favorite burger out of the three I tried was the RONIN burger!! Caramelized onions, cole slaw, a fried egg, and all of these delicious sauces... What's not to love?!?! The Shogun burger has a lot of hype because of the foie gras in it but none of the boys liked it. I thought it was tasty, BUT very sweet! due to all the fruit in it and perhaps more suited towards a girl's taste palate. However, there were a lot of different flavors and it could get a little overwhelming if you had to eat the entire thing.The miyagi-san's grass-fed wagyu burger tasted just like a good ol' fashioned BBQ burger if that's what you like but I felt that it was something I could get at a lot of other restaurants and a little plain for me especially after trying all of the other burgers bursting with flavors.If you live in the area and like burgers, you should definitely check this place out.

You can smell the burgers from the parking lot. If the smell is half what it taste like, I was going to be happy. It was and more. We got here at 3pm on A Thursday, only a few customers were present. We got seated immediately. Here's the rundown:Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage - delicious, almost like a JapaDog but skinnier and smaller. It was served with some whole grain honey mustard, perfect pairing. Yum!!Pork Belly Steamed Buns - OMG Delicious. You get 3 per order. The steamed bun was airy. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. Hoisin sauce made for a perfect little bite. My only quibble would be the boiled egg, which didn't add anything to the dish. A sunny side up quail egg would have been just over the top good on this, but that's just my take on it. It's still a very very good dish. Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - another winner. A huge portion of perfectly cooked fries (crunchy outside, soft inside) topped with Garlic Aioli, Stewed Oxtail and a Fried Egg. The oxtail by itself was so good, but adding everything else was just superb. Must order for sure. Shogun Burger - talk about a decadent burger. The burger is made with Wagyu Beef topped with Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, Yamamomo Peach & Arugula. It was salty, sweet, bitter, peppery, savory deliciousness. Is this what they call \"Umami\" if not I have a word for it \"Delicious!!\" It's got a hefty price tag, but well worth it. My son had the Grilled Cheese w/ Fries, Carrots and Apple. It was served with a B\u00e9arnaise sauce on the side. My son is a picky eater, but he devoured that grilled cheese. The adults devoured that b\u00e9arnaise sauce, oh so good.

The flavors aren't overdone and easily craveable. As for the Black & Green, it's a grass fed waygu as well, with mushrooms, spinach, point reyes blue cheese (Medium/full flavored), roasted garlic and bacon. Very deep and rich without being too strong and overpowering. If you are a fan of blue cheese this burger does your fandom some righteous justice. Bonus is that their buns are fresh, sweet and made local! Mmm, respect.For fries, I go for the Truffle Parmesan and if I have a partner to share with, the oxtail chili fries is the perfect plate with plenty to go around. for dessert, I have only had the chance to try their donuts.

I got here late in the afternoon at around 3 PM, and the wait was about 20 minutes. I think that's pretty good considering the other reviews I've read. We ordered the truffle parmesan fries, Wagyu burger, and the Kiki burger. The truffle parmesan fries were ok. I'm not too sure I liked the truffle sauce that much. It tasted very similar to Asian cafe mushroom sauce to me, but a little saltier and tangier. I think I would have enjoyed the fries more if it had just parmesan on it. While we were waiting for our burgers, I noticed the staff was in disarray. I saw way too many employees in the restaurant, and all of them were running around looking frazzled. The guests sitting at the table next to me were unhappy and complained about their burgers taking a long time. Our waiter later explained to us that they were having a problem with the computer system. I'm guessing some of the orders did not get put into the system, which caused the delay. Despite that, it seemed like a bad day for the staff. Our waiter did not even ask my husband how he wanted his burger cooked. When my husband told the waiter later that he did not get to tell him how he wanted the burger cooked, the waiter said he thought he said medium. Actually, I was the one who said medium. My husband always prefers his meats rare, so it's not possible for him to say medium. Anyway, when the burgers came out, they looked just like they look in the pictures: juicy and delicious. I was quite pleased with my Kiki burger, although I found it just a tad sweet. I enjoyed all the flavors mixed in together with the shiitake mushrooms, juicy Angus burger, the veggies, and the soft bread. I had a bite of the Wagyu burger and immediately fell in love with the Wagyu. I think I might have liked the Wagyu more than my Angus burger! I can see why people wait for this restaurant.

I would rank Spicy Miso, Kalbi (the Kim Chee was alright. nothing too spectacular since I've had much better Kim Chee but there was a lot of flavor in every bite) and then the Kiki's We randomly tried the pickled vegetables (see picture attached) and it wasn't anything special.

Needless to say, we walked right in, at just the right time before the impending rush, and snagged a table. Bachi offers some of the most inventive burgers imaginable. I sat for at least ten or so minutes agonizing over what to select. Finally, after drooling all over the table, I decided on Kiki's Burger, an Angus beef construction of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, an onion marmalade, and Gruyere cheese. My thought process was that the Gruyere would offer a nice balance to the sweetness of the marmalade. Unfortunately, it didn't function like I hoped it would; the burger was much too sweet for my liking. To Bachi's credit, they did cook it to a perfect medium. I don't fault them for my reaction to the burger -- it was just a miscalculation on my part. Next time, I'll be sure to select a burger that is made up of mostly savory ingredients. Visiting Bachi without also trying the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries would be very unfortunate. Not your typical chili cheese fry dish, to be certain. In fact, it's more like an oxtail poutine. It arrives served with a fried egg on top that you are left to bust open so that all the yoke smothers the pile of potatoes.

It is a gourmet burger joint, so it wasn't cheap, but it wasn't incredibly expensive either. I chose to build my own burger because all the burgers on the menu seemed to have one ingredient that I wasn't fond of. I didn't want to build a burger that was too big for my appetite, in fear that I wouldn't enjoy it, but I probably should've added all of those extras to counter the sweet patty. However, I'm not sure if the price of that would have sat right with me. Anyway... not that the meat was not cooked right--it was quality meat, juicy and well-seasoned--but I just did not enjoy my burger.

Other people at my table agreed that their burger was overly sweet as well... but what do you expect from a place called Bachi burger--derived from hibachi I assume. I would like to come back and try other non-burger items on the menu.

Everything started out great - assorted pickles, oxtail chili cheese fries with a fried egg on top, truffle Parmesan sweet potato fries with pineapple ketchup. Our server seemed to be having a rough day as she messed up our order several times and forgot to bring a coffee we ordered after asking about it on 4 separate occasions. I decided to go with the Shogun Burger ($26) which is Bachi's premium burger: wagyu beef prepared medium, foie gras, unagi, Asian pear and arugala. Something didn't taste right from the beginning but our server never even came by to ask how everything was and seemed way too busy to even want to bother her despite the fact we were sitting at the bar right in front of her. About halfway through the burger I deconstructed it to find out what was wrong and I realized the beef was the issue: over cooked, dry and completely flavorless. I spoke to the manager who came to the table in a very unpleasant manner and said she would take care of it. Upon returning she informed us that she had kindly removed 10% from the entire bill which sounded great but turned out to be $7 - $7 off of a $26 dry and flavorless burger. I told her it would not suffice and she informed me that since I had eaten half of the burger, that 10% is all she could do. She offered to make a new burger for FULL PRICE and I told her that is completely inappropriate. After she went back and showed my burger to the chef who was arguing with her in plain sight which allowed me to see and hear everything he was saying, he told her to comp the burger in disgust. She brought the bill back, threw it down in front of us and walked away without saying a word. I'm not saying this is a typical day at Bachi Burger but it was absolutely disgusting behavior. The burger was just bad. The meat was flavorless and the patty was about as thick as a Burger King Whopper patty - definitely not $26 restaurant quality, especially since the other burger that was ordered was a thick and juicy correctly prepared and very flavorful patty. To top it all off, the bathroom was a complete mess with what looked like food or possibly some human excrement ground into the floor: I nearly vomited at the sight. Despite all of this, I would not expect to have the same experience again and would give the place another shot and I would recommend it to others because there are so many options on the menu.In the end, they handled the bill correctly and comped the burger but they are completely ill prepared for handling these situations. Our server seemed so overwhelmed and busy that she was completely inattentive but was very kind and compassionate and apologized repeatedly for the quality of the food. A patron shouldn't have to argue their case for a $26 Burger - you're a restaurant, own up to your mistake and take care of it.

The pickles (and everything else) was plated very aesthetically and just lovely to look at. I got the Miyagi-san and it was okay. Maybe I was satiated so my brain wasn't as receptive to it. Or maybe it was that the steamed buns were so good that these paled in comparison. Or I just chose the wrong burger combo. Whatever it was, I didn't feel the beef had nearly as much flavor as the pork belly packed. I wished the beef was marinated more or something. I did love the bread though which was squishy and soft.My bf got the Honeydew boba and that was disgusting. They did not put nearly enough powder to make it taste sweet.

This is definitely a nice place to go to for a unique tasting burger & appetizers. I mean that in a good way of course, however, the reason I am not giving this place 5 stars has nothing to do with menu items or cuisine, but rather the inconsistency of quality. It is quite obvious that they have one or two really good chefs that are phenomenal cooks, and all the others are pretty much bench players.Now, I don't know how many chefs they have but I came to this conclusion through logical reasoning, for I couldn't imagine their star chef having such an off day that they would produce \"BBQ in the park with friends\" quality food. So, the first 2 visits were great and then one bad, one good, and the last bad. It seems that on the busy days, like on a weekend, are the best times to go which were my first to visits. The other three visits were done through the weekdays, so if you go through the week my experience has been hit or miss (but as the record stands more miss during the week).

I remember the first time biting into the burger at the other Bachi location.. I had one of those euphoric moments of satisfaction where all I was thinking was, \"WOW\"! The ingredients compliment each other perfectly, with the shitake mushrooms, caramalized bacon and the garlic chili aioli supporting the perfectly cooked patty.. amazing!Other burgers I've tried:Ronin- the sauce in this one is great.Banh-Mi- a detailed mixture of Vietnamese flavors put on a burger. Looks simple but has a burst of flavor.Shogun($26)- so many flavors I've never tasted before generated in this one burger. Pretty amazing with the Wagyu Beef and Unagi. For your first time, I suggest ordering the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with your burger. It is truly one-of-a-kind. Sweet and meaty.. no need to dip in any sauce. If it seems too much, the Truffle Parmesan Fries is a tasty alternative.It seems like Bachi's business and popularity is starting to blossom.

I have frequented this restaurant before and would give it 3 to 4 stars on those visit. This visit was different for the following reasons:1. We were put on a waiting list with our phone number so the hostess could call us. We returned to check on our spot and the hostess said she had just called our party. The hostess before did not communicate that they were using phone numbers. (must have been a shift change). Not a big deal by itself. We had good timing and did not lose our spot.2. Server did not introduce himself and was very cold and lacked any personality or genuine concern. While the service was not terrible it was definitely lacking. 3. We were going to split 4 burgers. we requested that our burgers be cut in quarters so we could do this easily. The server told us her could bring us steak knives but they wont serve it cut. I asked another server and she said the same thing.4. We decided to do one less burger since we were not able to have the burgers cut to share. We decided it would be too much of a project to try to do at our table with steak knives. Two of the people in our party were going to split a burger and the other two would have there own.5. We asked if it was possible to get the burger that was being shared cut in half. It was a plain Jane burger and I was sure the kitchen could handle this. This resulted in a female staff member who I assume was a manager visiting my table to explain that they did not want to cut the burger because it would change the presentation(the cook wants the presentation his way) and the kitchen is really busy, \"so in order to expedite the cooking process they would prefer not to cut the burger\". This was a bit of an insult to anyone who has worked in the culinary world not to mention a paying guest.6. The manager took a uncompromising position as I did let her know this. The server hawked over our table the remainder of the visit, most likely to try to regain any lost tip (we still tipped 20%). In summary, the food was good, but there are plenty of burger joints in the Las Vegas area, many of which I will visit more frequently in place of Bachi Burger. They are pricey as well in comparison to more established burger joints.The customer service aspect and the arrogant manner in which the manager handled a simple request was what drove down this experience the most. My sister reminded me on this visit that she had previously come here and the chef refused to add lettuce to a burger because \"it would change the taste profile of the food\".Advice to the chef: despite your enthusiasm for what YOU want, what YOU want comes second to what the GUEST wants. The guest is paying for a product as well as an experience. Without us, the GUESTS, YOU are out of a job.Advice to the manager/supervisor: If you want to help the business grow as well as add to your professional success you will have a much easier road granting a special request rather than insulting your patrons intelligence by discussing logistics of a burger kitchen. In the time it took to give your enthusiastic lecture on expediting product from the kitchen, you might have been able to cut 20 or 30 burgers or maybe even grant a simple request to go above and beyond your current set of service standards. Instead we ordered one less burger on this visit, skipped desert and probably wont be back. YOUR JOB IS TO ENSURE GUEST SATISFACTION WHILE CREATING GUEST/BRAND LOYALTY. THE GUEST IS ALWAYS RIGHT.

That oxtail chili cheese fries were seriously out of this world hearty goodness. You topped that off with that beautiful sunny side up egg was simply perfection. I can't even find a flaw in this dish because it has everything I love in the dish. Just enough jalopeno to have a little kick to the fries and those beautiful cilantro to further enhance the flavor. The oxtail were seasoned well and it was almost melt in your mouth. If you really want to complain about it, it is simply because it is one of those dishes that will give you an instant heart attack. I totally recommend sharing it between 2-3 people and then ordering a burger. I also got the Miyagi-San burger which totally reminds me of Karate Kid. ANYWAY...I was reading the descriptions and it had Onions rings and kobe beef patty and i was like bring it on baby. I totally recommend patting it a bit before you take a bite so it will stay together when you eat. When I took my first bite, I simply went OOOOOOO. That patty was simply juicy as hell and those onions rings were the real eye opener. They weren't your typical onion rings because they fried those onion rings with tempura battered which made it extremely delicious.

Rumored to be the best burger and it did not disappoint. I don't know about BEST, but it did rank in the top burgers of my life. Right off the bat, service could be a lot better. There was a wait of 3 parties in the cramped lobby of the restaurant when you could PLAINLY see that there were 5+ open tables in the back. Our waitress told us there would be a 20-25 minute wait for a table of 5. So we went to the bar in the middle of the restaurant where there were at least 4 tables that could accommodate us... Sounds like a ploy to get us to spend more money on drinks! Well, it worked. The bar isn't the best. Drafts are a bit pricey, got a Sapporo for $5. But my friend got a well drink called \"Kambei\" that was DELICIOUS. It was minty and grapefruity and super refreshing. Highly recommend. So as soon as we got our drinks an empty table just happened to open up! And we were seated, 10 minutes into our estimated wait time..ANYWAY, onto the food. I ordered/tasted: The Ronin Burger, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries, Truffle Fries, and Kalbi Burger. Ronin Burger: SO GOOD. I ordered medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly. Really tender and juicy! \u00a0Pork Belly Steamed Buns: Not the biggest fan of pork but the meat was tender and yumz. The buns though, were awesome! Perfectly steamed. Ox-Tail Chili Cheese Fries: These were amazing. My friends and I demolished them in 5 minutes. Meat melted in your mouth and the runny yolk of the fried egg made the dish.

When my husband got his drink there was a piece of mint or some type of green leaf in it which was big enough to where I don't know how the server didn't see it if he was paying any attention. The price for our two burgers, two fries, and a soft drink came out to being about $50 before tip. All in all, the place was okay, and not great. It wasn't a place where I knew right away I would be coming back very soon and especially for the price, I didn't feel it was worth it. The meat was good, but I feel like it's only better in your head because you know the beef is grass fed beef.

Maybe I'm spoiled by Yard House's famous truffle fries... but these were borderline soggy, and the parmesan completely overpowered the black truffle sauce. The sun-dried tomato aioli couldn't save these fries.Sweet potato fries: The best I've had in awhile. Crispy exterior, fluffy interior.

I even smothered it on my burger.Tried a bite of our friend's oxtail chili cheese fries, and while it was good, it still just taste like chili cheese fries--nothing special.I ordered the Ronin burger, which was pretty good at first, but the over-medium egg added a strange dry texture to the burger. The accompanying sauce didn't do anything for the burger either, which is why I added the sauce from our fries. Overall, the burger was alright, but the meat is where my issue is. The whole patty was oddly shaped like a perfectly formed puck (smooth, even edges and everything), and while I ordered mine medium rare, I've NEVER had a burger cooked to that degree and NOT be able to fall apart when I stick my fork through the middle of it. I tried to get the meat to crumble by wiggling my fork back and forth, but it just wouldn't... which greatly alarms me. The meat was so packed together it wouldn't even disentangle itself even though it wasn't even cooked through. Strange..I also ordered an iced green tea to go along with my meals and it was alright too. Sure, you get unlimited refills, but my second glass tasted really diluted to me. At $4, I'd just stick with the free water.Boyfriend ordered the Miyagi-san and said his burger was good but wasn't that great either. He didn't seem too impressed with the wagyu patty.

I couldn't find a warning anywhere when I went online and skimmed it.3) The replacement burger they gave me just had lettuce and the spicy mayonnaise on it. Turns out, the kimchi also had shrimp (a lot of kimchi doesn't have shrimp, so I didn't think to ask if it wouldn't have any shrimp) so instead of being given the option to change my burger, they just gave me a very plain burger.4) The plain burger was decently moist, the bun had the right amount of crispiness. The spicy mayo was delicious!5) Service was quick and good.So for all that the burger was good and the fries decent (parmesan, truffle oil, something fries), the lack of clarity on their menu for shrimp related items left me very disappointed and almost sick.

It's very flavorful and a simple burger. If you like fried eggs with your traditional burgers, then you will have no problem liking the Ronin.- Kalbi: It's Kalbi marinated with house made Kim Chee. I just love the taste of marinated Kalbi. The marinated Angus beef is full-bodied with a kick of their house mayo. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection. It almost melts in your mouth. This one is a nice one to have if you've never had Kalbi before. -Crusty Crab: If you love crab like I do...then you will enjoy this burger! \u00a0I like this one not only because it's crab, but the chutney sauce that is on it.

We ordered the Oxtail Chili fries and shared a Banh Mi Burger. I was in heaven! I loved them both. My favorite part bout the fries were the fried egg. It was like eating potatoes and eggs for breakfast with some delicious oxtail chili! My husband didn't care for the egg, so it worked out perfectly. I got the egg to myself. ;) The Banh Mi burger had wonderful flavor. If you've ever had a Banh Mi and love it, you will enjoy the Banh Mi burger. It marries the flavors of Asian and American perfectly. Before leaving Vegas, we went again. This time on a Wednesday at around the same time. Once again, we got in right away but there was only one server working and he was running all over place. There were about 4 other tables that he was waiting on besides us. I don't understand why it's so understaffed. I did notice what looked to be a manager (based on what he was wearing) and two other gals \"working\" in the back.

You are sitting in a row of 50 other people eating 2 feet next to you. It feels like a school cafeteria. Last time we came they were going through a remodel. Maybe they added a few barstools.Food:Fries brought out 15 min before the burger. They were soggy when they brought them out. Ordered the burgers medium/well because my girlfriend just recently had food poisoning so we didnt want to take any chances. Both of our burgers came out COMPLETElY RARE on the inside. Its was seriously cold uncooked meat in both of our burgers. Staff: This is the absolute most horrible part about our experience. I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. We first sat at a table and after no one saying a word to us for 5 minutes, we decided to move to the bar in hopes of getting some service. Sat at the bar for another 5 minutes until a gentlemen named John who I later found out was the manager came up to us asking if we needed anything. \u00a0I answered \"yes we have not been helped yet, we're ready to order\". This guy gives me the most blank stare like he was stoned out of his mind and says \"ok one second\". He proceeds to go behind behind the bar and walks over to this kid with \u00a0mo-hawk like hair who's busy making drinks and points at us while telling him something. The mo-hawk guy shrugs his shoulders and the manager walks away. A few moments later a girl with blonde hair comes over an takes our order. Fries come out first. Soggy and not good. We look around for the waitress or manager who are both nowhere to be found to send the fries back. Here comes the most crazy thing I have ever seen in a restaurant in my life. The manager walks behind the bar, grabs a bottle of Fireball Whisky, and pours 2 shots in to shot glasses. He taps the mo-hawk guy on the shoulder, hands him a shot very sneaky like and starts walking towards my girlfriend and I. Right when I was about to open my mouth to say something about the fries he bends down right in front of us pretending to tie his shoe or something and takes the shot. He literally stands up with the most disgusted look on his face (as all people have when doing fireball). My girlfriend and I both sat there with our mouths dropped open. He knew instantly that he was busted. (stealing alcohol and drinking while \"managing\") He disappeared in the back room and the mo-hawk guy went back to making drinks. Our burgers came out a few minutes later. We both checked to make sure the burgers were plenty cooked. Cold rare meat. They were slightly seared on the outside. I figured The girl didnt hear me right and rang them up as medium/rare on accident. When she came by the bar I flagged her down showing her the burger and the uncooked meat. She asks us if we want the burgers remade. I said politely to her \"no thank you, we've actually been having a really bad experience. Nothing to do with you.\" Her only answer to that statement was \"OK\" then she walked away as if she was upset for some reason? I didnt know what that meant so I sat there for another minute when she came back to the bar and says to me \"Well I checked the order and I put it in medium/well how you asked. Sorry you didnt like it\". She then drops the check on the counter and walks away. I was very surprised that she not only brought me the check for food that we didnt take one bite of, but she didnt even bring a manager out or address our concerns. I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar. The blonde stared at me and looked at another server who said to her \"John\" implying that he was well aware of John drinking on the job. They told me that he was the only manager there but the nice male server agreed with me that I shouldnt have to talk to a drunk manager about my issues. He gave me the name of the owner \"Aaron\" and let them know I was not paying for food I didnt eat and I wanted to talk to the owner tomorrow to let him know about my experience. I could show him all the problems with his restaurant starting with his so called \"manager\" who stands around doing shots instead of trying to help the business flow better.

However, my friend gave me the impression that this is one of the best go-to places in Vegas. I was hesitant at first because I was hoping for some good Thai, but my friend's enthusiasm got me suspicious -- could a burger place be that good that it warrants a visit by him and his family each time they're in Vegas??? So I acquiesced...I ordered the Miyagi-san without a bun (and I gave away my onion rings since they were battered) -- and boy, it was so yummo-licious I wanted to lick the plate. I ate every morsel, and since I didn't eat a bun, my stomach had room for garlic fries & their perfectly-lightly-sweetened plantation tea.My two complaints are:1. They did not list their operating hours...we had to wait for them to open at 11am...seriously, this place needs to be 24/7!2. Almost ruined my mood when the waitress told me the chef could not make my Shogun special with fois-grae without butter. =(Anyhoo, place that can make a bun-less burger taste the way it does has my vote, and a perfect blend of burger-Asian fusion to boot!

However, allow my review to encourage you to try the Bachi Fish. \u00a0Both restaurants are clean, service always great, and I have never been disappointed with a Bachi visit.", "Date": "2013-01-26", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Tammy F.", "ReviewID": "xfetDdaLXbtoBmqLY8Sk1w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty good burger joint!!

I've been there on numerous occasions and let me tell you, I could ponder that fork in the road for hours...if only there was a place that served both..... Tadaaaa!Well, it's not exactly one place, more like two places adjacent to each other by chef/owner Lorin Watada; whose fusion burger fame, 'Bachi Burger' has propelled her into Ramen game - the current 'it' food in Vegas. \u00a0Not that there can be enough Japanese fare in my opinion!Hachi Machi, give me a Bachi!!!Bachi Burger is a Japanese Hybrid Burger joint serving the American classic \u00a0with Japanese twists. \u00a0It's become the culinary zeitgeist to throw a bunch of 'Asian' ingredients on anything and see what whacked flavor comes out (yack) yielding moderate to disastrous results. \u00a0Innovation is great but sometimes you just have to go simple. \u00a0But when I feel like having something other than you standard Burger fare, I look to Bachi - the flavor combinations are nostalgic and the burger quality is pretty good. \u00a0Also, there's a proximity and it's open all the time (unlike the Foodtrucks that are sooo good, but just a scheduling/coordinating pain). \u00a0There's a previous review of Bachi - go ahead and read and you'll get what I'm talking about below...Did you read it? Ok, good. Just as a summary, they serve a lot of Asian style dishes as appetizers, Chinese Bao's, Chicken Karage and Edamame, so you get a harmonic blend of Asian bites with All American Burgers. And for a guy like me who has trouble deciding on one cuisine, I get a bit of everything like an international buffet..but with good food.Truffle Parmesan Fries:Parmesan Reggiano + Black Truffle Porcini Cream + Sun Dried Tomato Aioli. \u00a0In my previous posts, I complained that I enjoyed what little gravy they provided for this cone heap of Fries that they stingily provide.It seems that someone was listening; upon my recent visit, the Fries came with a generous portion of the creamy gravy that made those Fries uber luxurious and thoroughly fulfilling. \u00a0The Sun Dried Tomato Aioli does not work at all with the Truffle cream, however, since there is a portion of fries near the bottom of the cone that is not coated with decadent sauce, the Aoli serves a good condiment for those untouched by the earthy goddess...Kiki Burger I've had the Ronin Burger which was pretty good, and the Black and Green Burger was amazing. \u00a0But my favorite is the Kiki Burger: an Angus Beef Patty with saut\u00e9ed Shitake, Eryngii and Enoki Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese and a Garlic Aioli. \u00a0When I first reviewed this Burger, my biggest complaint was that overabundant smattering of the Aioli drowning out the flavor of all the other ingredients, including the Burger.Well, much to my pleasure, they had listened; the Plate was served with the Aioli on the side, which could be knifed on to one's liking. \u00a0This made a world of difference, you could taste all the awesome flavors that this burger has to offer: The charcoal permeated through the Beef, which alone was satisfying, the Gruyere + Caramelized Bacon elevated the unctuous bass level notes, while the Sweet Onion Marmalade was savory and sweet. I added my own level of Garlic Aioli, just enough kick to spice it up before each bite....Super delish!So, now it come down to the Battle: who won?For Appetizers: \u00a0I don't know, they both so different!!For Main: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I can't choose - they're both sooo good!!!For Dessert: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bleah.....There really is no battle, if you feel like having Burgers, ie. red meat, got to Bachi. \u00a0If you cold and need to warm up with a great bowl of Ramen with some great Broth, get yourself on over to Shoku Ramen Ya. \u00a0I love both of these places and it's always hard to decide each time I'm in front of these two doors!Bachi Burger \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ratings (Out of Five Stars) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Food: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 4.5 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ambience: \u00a03 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Service: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Always start off with a plate of Gyoza, it's like a cultural tradition of Ramen Shops to provide these half dozen, moon shaped crispy delights stuck together like little piglets. \u00a0It's always a little game to try and pick them off without ripping the skin, retaining the piping hot filling within its crackling confines. \u00a0As for t", "Date": "2013-04-08", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Rachel M.", "ReviewID": "HEKVuhoG3hB3o_5XAtGvFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the miyagi burger is the most DELICIOUS burger i've had in my life...don't be discouraged about the fried egg, (even though i like fried eggs) you can't even tasted it when combined with the bacon, onion rings and whatever sauce/spices they put on it...uuhhh i want another! also, the service was excellent.", "Date": "2014-01-12", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Dang N.", "ReviewID": "XEBFp_JtHI9cShVmG2okiA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So this place amuses me.

We got there around 11am and apparently just beat the crowd, cuz as we were leaving the line was out the door. First thing I ordered - the Oxtail Chili Fries (minus the onions & cilantro). Now with that out of the way - lets look at the burgers. I decided on the Miyagi-san burger, which consists of Chili Mayo,Fried Egg ,Furikake, Caramelized Bacon & Crispy Onion Rings. I also got a soda to wash it all down with -which the waitress forgot to bring to us til halfway thru the fries cuz I asked again. Anyways - the fries are good. The oxtail is shredded and the the chili has a slight kick to it. The egg while its looks good, actually gets in the way. No one wants to be the first person to cut into it and if it were up to me - I'd pop the yolk and let it run into the chili! The Burger - SO EFFIN GOOD! The first thing I noticed was that the buns are actually the same as the baked chau siu bao. Golden brown with a slight glaze. The burger itself was nice and juicy. So juicy that it runs down your hand and arm while holding it. So make sure you get extra napkins. The bacon and furikake was a nice addition! Possibly the best burger I've had.Overall - great food.

As appetizers we got the pork buns and the oxtail chili cheese fries. Holy crap they were so good. The buns were soft and not heavy and the pork belly had enough fat that melted in my mouth. It had the hoisin sauce on the side for dipping which was super tasty and great sweetness to it. I think its not as good as Momofuku's pork buns but its still up there. Probably my second favorite. The oxtail chili cheese-fries was bangin!! It was so heavy because of beans and sunny side up egg but still so worth it. The jalapenos were to hot to eat because of the 113 degree weather but any other day it would have been fine. \u00a0We could have stopped eating and that could have been all we ate. Of course we didn't and made ourselves look like fat asses when ordering the burgers. He had the Ronin and I had the $26 dollar Shogun burger.

But I have to say that Bachi burger is the real deal. Normally food like burgers and fries are very heavy and make you get the Itus aka food coma. Buf after eating here I felt light and refreshed. The food is a nice play on Asian fusion burgers and fries so if you're familiar with Asian food you'll get the subtle nature of how the flavors come together. (hats off to the chef because there are some very cleaver combinations).The staff was friendly and we were seated right away. I know this place is off the strip, but at 4pm it was packed. So if you want to try this place go around the 2pmish time. My friend and I came here at 3:30 pm and there was a 20 minute wait so we opted to go to the bar. \u00a0No less than 30 minutes later there was a line at the entrance and people waiting outside.The burgers here are an excellent value and the Foie gras burger was on par pricing wise compared to the one I had on the strip ($28 range) the other burgers are ala cart and were around $8-12 depending on what you want in it. I had the spicy miso burger and that was definitely a knife and fork burger (or lots of napkin burger). The burger was cooked to perfection. I really like the Taiwanese bun it was something different than what the normal burger joint has. So all you Vegas ppl \u00a0if you rent a car I suggest that you go out here and try it. \u00a0If you don't like it and are in vegas when I am I'll buy you lunch somewhere else** Note: participant must be in vegas the same time as me and must not like bachi burger.

Our waitress was not very accommodating and tended to ignore us, and the food took about 30-40 minutes to come out after we ordered. If it hadn't been for that, I might have rated this restaurant higher. I was excited to try this place and bring my dad because he doesn't venture out to try new places very often. I thought he would like the asian-fusion style burgers and flavors. I was super excited to try the Peking Style Steamed Duck Buns because it's my absolute favorite dish to get when I'm eating at a legit Chinese or Cantonese style restaurant. I didn't expect Bachi Burger's version to be as good, and I was right. Overall, the flavors just didn't work for me (a lot of cilantro, radish, boiled egg, black vinaigrette and BBQ sauce) and the duck didn't taste fresh. Nice effort though. My dad tried Kiki's burger, which is angus beef, shiitake mushrooms, caramelized bacon, onion marmalade, cheese and garlic chili aioli. I can't really recall how this tasted, so it must not have really made much of an impression (doesn't mean it was bad though). I thought that their burgers would be similar in style and flavor to Umami Burger, but luckily their burgers are bigger and seem more filling than Umami's. We also shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which had some black truffle porcini cream on it. It was good, but I love all things fries. Expect burgers to cost around $10 each, which I would say is a fair price. Atmosphere-wise, this seems like a fun place to go with a group to watch sports or just eat lunch/dinner. They serve a variety of milk tea/boba drinks also, which is nice. If you're looking for some unique flavor combinations and you have a taste for asian-style cuisine, by all means check this place out.

Unfortunately, their burgers failed to make it in my top ten. They weren't bad... they just weren't as good as other gourmet burgers I've had.I ordered the Miyagi-san Burger (medium-rare) w/ Parmesan Truffle Fries. My wife got the Ronin Burger (medium) with regular fries. They arrived at our table about half an hour later, and we immediately noticed her burger was bloodier than mine. This was not a good start for my wife. We would have asked to cook it more, but we were already running short on time, so we split our burgers (which we were going to do anyway) since mine was less bloody.I thought the Miyagi-san was good... I definitely enjoyed it more than the Ronin, which wasn't as flavorful IMO. I liked the crunchy texture from the onion rings, but overall, I was a bit underwhelmed. I think there was just too much going on. The more burgers I eat, the more I appreciate the simplicities of them. And as bloody as both patties were, I found them to be a bit dry. The sauces on the burgers added the juiciness to them, not the patties.The Ronin didn't have as much going on as the Miyagi-san, but it wasn't any better as a whole. The caramelized onions were good, but that was about it. The slaw was barely noticeable, and the sauce didn't make a big impact for me. And the buns on both burgers barely managed to hold up.The Parmesan Truffle Fries were mediocre at best. I thought the truffle part meant they would just be fried w/ truffle oil or that the fries would be topped with truffle shavings, but they basically dumped this truffle-ish sauce over the fries that was very overwhelming. It felt like I was dipping the fries in a mushroom soup. I did not enjoy this. The only saving grace was the sun-dried tomato dipping sauce on the side.Service was great and the restaurant was clean, but when it comes to the food, I'd say Bachi is just A-OK.

Well, it's a fusion burger place off the Strip, and it's supposed to be pretty good.Maybe I'll try it, I said, but thinking I probably won't because we might be too lazy to leave the Strip. But right after we checked in, my addicted-to-burgers bestie readily agreed to go even though she was sick and didn't have an appetite. Excited that she showed some interest in food, we passed on eating Earl's with our other friends and went to Bachi instead.When we got there, we didn't have much of a wait since it was kind of late. The interior was pretty open-spaced, simple and clean. We were seated quickly, and my friend wasted no time in ordering her burger AND fries despite having the flu! We ended up with the miyagi-san's grass fed wagyu burger, black and green burger, and truffle parmesan fries.Behold the burgers: miyagi sans (yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN\u2026) and black and green (yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN\u2026).Wasn't sure how I was supposed to eat the miyagi-sans burger because it was stacked pretty high, but it sure was tasty. Grass-fed wagyu with fried egg, chili mayo, carmelized bacon, and onion crisps. The flavors were prominent, and the oozing egg yolk on top of a juicy patty was delicious.The black and green burger was pretty good, but not as good in my opinion. It was slightly more bland with an earthly, sweet taste. The fries were drizzled with black truffle porcini cream that was pretty good. Not amazing though. It also came with a sun-dried tomato aoili, which was unnecessary because it didn't pair well with the fries. It was a good meal overall though.

Truffle Parmesan fries ($5.50)- I love skinny fries! These were cooked to a slight crisp, which I definitely enjoyed. \u00a0The black truffle porcini cream provided a nice savory saltiness to the fries, but the sun-dried tomato aioli really sealed the deal. \u00a0I'm not a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes, but this aioli rocked my socks.. I found myself spreading it on my burger throughout the meal!2. Kiki's burger ($11.00)- I do love me some mushrooms! I found the burger to be rather bland, even with the 3 types of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, bacon, and sweet onion marmalade. \u00a0I liked that the bacon had a slight smoky flavor, which paired well with the sweet onions and mushrooms, but I didn't care much for the garlic chili aioli. \u00a0The aioli definitely just tasted like garlic chili and mayo, and I preferred spreading the sun-dried tomato aioli on this burger to amp up the flavor. \u00a0The bun totally reminded me of cha siu bao (bbq pork buns), and upon first bite, the onions and bacon really made me think it tasted just like one..Must've been my mind playing tricks on me!3. Mr. Ho's burger ($10.00)- The taro bun was what intrigued me! \u00a0The bun was like a taro bun from a bakery- purple and sweet! Overall, I thought this burger was really sweet and saucy. \u00a0It was a bit too sweet for me and my boyfriend, though.. It might have been due to the sweet taro bun and the sweetness of the \u00a0lup cheong (Chinese sausage). \u00a0We ended up only finishing half of this burger, but oh man! The cold leftover half (which we snacked on a couple of hours later) was so good! \u00a0I assume that the flavors settled and had absorbed into the bread while the burger cooled and dried out.. That must've also helped to mellow out the overall sweetness. \u00a0The interior was nice.. An unfinished, modern, cool, and relaxed feel.. Service was good, music was loud, and they allowed guests to sit and have a drink at the bar while waiting for a table.

At any given time, a dozen people were starting at \u00a0the tv above us, which just feels weird while trying to eat and several times during our meal some jerk literally walked up to our table to stare into the tv. Way uncool. We started with a couple apps. The basic edamame was perfect. The grilled shishito peppers were bland, needed salt and were skewered with little tomatoes which were good and a tough slice of fibrous mushroom. We had 3 burgers. The black and green burger was mostly good but had a weird sweetness to it and too much vegetable on top. The same goes for the spicy miso burger. again mostly good but a weird sweetness and a awkward assembly - too much vegggie, topping. Also, I felt like I had to eat it fast to save the bun. The bun made it to the end, but was a dime thin \u00a0rubbery disc by the time I finished, and I ate it fast. the third burger, the kiki was just weird. the mushrooms were hard and chewy with a bad mouth feel, it was strange biting into it. Like the previous two, it had a weird sweetness. I didn't finish it. It was just odd tasting. All three burgers felt like unresolved experiments. All three felt \u00a0awkward, like a poor attempt at fusion cuisine, too far removed from the familiar burger world but not like any asian cuisine I've had. None of the three burgers tasted all that good and all just felt strange, too sweet, poorly assembled, out of balance. We had a side of truffle fries which were served in a cone with a spicy aioli on the side. The fries on top were very good but all of the ones below were wet and soggy. We had their recommended portuguese donuts. They were disappointing. Very dense and tough balls of dough rolled in too much sugar and cinnamon served with a bit of rock hard ice cream.

Lots of flavor and definitely filling. Make sure you share this one!I also had their pork belly steamed buns. A nice thick, tender piece of pork belly in every white, fluffy bun.

It's the sweetest piece of fruit you'll probably ever have. Good stuff.After you take one bite of the burger, you'll feel like eating it slowly so you can savor each bite. The saltiness from the foie gras enhances the sweetness of the pear and unagi. And there's also a hint of truffle oil on the top of the bun. The combination sounded weird at first, but all the flavors really work together. Probably the best burger I've EVER had, but it has a hefty price of $25... WORTH. EVERY.

Since I'm an easy sell and pretty much a sucker for advertising, that was endorsement enough for me to search out this place.As soon as I saw the Shogun burger on the chalkboard outside, I knew I had to be an idiot and go for it. (I'm particularly susceptible to chalkboard marketing, I should add.) \u00a0The shogun is one of their specialty wagyu beef burgers with a layer of unagi, pan-seared foie gras (this is what sold me), thin slices of asian pear and miso butter spread. On the side they throw in a yamamomo peach. Not sure why but maybe it helps theoretically justify the $25 price tag. \u00a0Before we get to the burgers, I gotta say that the milkshakes (all of them) were awesome. Creamy, thick and diabetes-inducing. I liked my strawberry-guava, but everyone else thought the peanut butter one was tops. The much-talked-about ox-tail fries were a surprise. The ox-tail \"stew\" covering the french fries is actually a little sweet and tasted great. I thought it would just be chili-cheese fries using ox-tail but it had a different flavor than I anticipated. \u00a0We had to stop ourselves from ordering seconds so we wouldn't ruin our appetites. Okay, main event. So I bought the biggest, baddest burger off the regular menu. Did I love it? Honestly for the price I found it okay. The beef they use for their burger tasted good, and when I bite into a burger I don't watch sauces or ketchup to take away from the lovely flavor of cow carcass. The unagi was my least favorite part because its flavor really overpowered everything else (except for sweetness of the pear) and made every bite just taste like unagi. So minus the unagi, I'm left with a good beef patty, pear and foie gras. It all tasted pretty good, but I wouldn't recommend it for $25.I also tried the Ronin burger which has a little sweetness too from a layer of coleslaw and I really enjoyed it overall. Next time I have to try the pork steamed buns and some of the other burgers as well. Maybe the Shogun didn't live up to my expectations, but I still had a great meal and will be back next time I'm in Vegas.Oh, and that yamamomo peach?

It appears they have two locations around the Las Vegas area although they are opening one up in West LA in 2013 which is good for me. This burger joint is somewhat distant from the strip, however, well worth the stop. I'd recommend coming during off peak hours. When we were leaving, there was a big line for dinner to this place, a indicator that there is good food inside. The service was really good. The waiters were trained to introduce themselves and to answer any questions that we had about the menu.As an appetizer, I had a piece of my friend's Pork Belly Steamed Buns It contained Duroc Pork Belly, cilantro, scallions, radish, boiled egg, Chinese black vinaigrette, and hoisin sauce. I typically don't like eating steamed buns, but when I took a bite into this, it was SO GOOD! It made me rethink my stance on steamed buns.Also, I requested the fries to come as an appetizer. I ordered their truffle parmesan fries which contains parmesan reggiano, black truffle shavings, chives, and comes with a side of sun dried tomato aioli dipping sauce. I was disappointed at their truffle fries. I was hoping that they would have utilized truffle oil to cook the fries. Instead, it tasted your typical french fry you would have at any fast food place. If I had to do it over again, I would skip the fries as their selection of burgers and appetizers are so much more appealing.Finally, for the main course, I had the Spicy Miso Burger which contains a massive patty of Angus beef, onions, shishito peppers, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, and apple vinaigrette sauce. When a took a bite out of this sandwich, I was wondering what happened to the shishito peppers? I didn't really taste the peppers at all. I was completely overwhelmed by the apple vinaigrette sauce. The sandwich was decent, but the combination of ingredients is suspect. Perhaps there is too much going on in the sandwich where it loses its identity as a spicy miso burger.

Our beer glasses were delivered hot and dirty.2. Our fries were delivered cold.3. Their burgers are served medium, so I always ask for medium well. My boyfriend asked for medium. Mine was served bloody and his was served well done. He ate his unhappily but I could not stomach mine and after we had to literally flagged down the waiter, I sent mine back. He brought back the same burger (which I had cut into) with the meat cooked to well. Again, not medium well. I found it to be odd that they would just reheat the patty, but oh well, I ate it. Mind you, this was delivered well after my boyfriend had finished his burger (I told him to go ahead because I did not want his to get as cold as our fries). 4. Nothing was done to make this right. I posted on Facebook, tagged them, and sent a comment to their fan page ... and nothing. I realize dining experiences aren't always perfect; however, they should have comped my burger or offered a free dessert.

I had a foodgasm just reading that decadent description but when I saw that it was $25, I painfully had to choose another burger.In the end, I went with the bahn mi burger since my sister-in-law read good reviews of this burger. I figured I couldn't go wrong with this since I love bahn mi sandwiches. According to the description, the bahn mi burger contained the following ingredients: Angus Beef, pork, shrimp, lemongrass, pork pate, fresh herbs, curry aioli, with pickled vegetables and Nuoc Mam Sauce on the side. If I didn't have read the description before chowing down, I wouldn't \u00a0have known the pate, pork or shrimp was in this burger. I think there were so many flavors going on that those got lost in the mix. I had my burger cooked to medium and my oh my it was so juicy! I also enjoyed the fresh herbs (aka mint and cilantro), pickled veggies the curry aioli. Those flavors when so well together! I personally thought the Nuoc Mam sauce (aka fish sauce) was unnecessary since there was a lot of other flavors going on. Overall I really enjoyed this burger.The three of us split the truffle parmesean fries, which were very tasty by themselves. The black porchini creme sauce that was drizzled over it was just as tasty but I felt that the sun dried tomato aioli was unnecessary for dipping.Despite what other reviews have mentioned, I though the service was fine.

So on to the Crusty Crab...I'm not use to mushy...If you like your crab crispy....I would pass on this one. \u00a0It was mushy....I wasn't expecting this to be mushy. \u00a0It was eitable, but I think crispy is better. \u00a0 I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. \u00a0Try something else, unless you don't mind mushy.The employee's seemed like they were stressed out! \u00a0It was crazy busy, and this is a Wednesday night. \u00a0 \u00a0I would hate to see it on a Friday or Saturday.I think if I go back, I will call ahead, and only get it to go, the host said it's busy all the time! \u00a0Great for them, but I don't like to wait like that.", "Date": "2013-01-10", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Marcie W.", "ReviewID": "MIkYKuiO8LU3CydF3wirHA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is late times two... it is a combo review about both of our experiences to the same Bachi Burger location!During our first visit, my husband and I stopped in for lunch on an early Wednesday afternoon in October. The restaurant was fairly empty at this time, we were immediately seated and our hardest decision was deciding what delicious goodies to try first! We opted on sharing the Pork Belly Steam Buns, the Kiki Burger and an order of the Parmesan Truffle Fries. HOLY heck, amazing! I consider burgers and fries one of my true life weaknesses and these had me needing a new set of panties they were so good. As if all of that wasn't enough, we even opted to try their homemade Portuguese Donuts for dessert. Also scrumptious and well worth the splurge! Not only could we not wait to return, we wanted to bring friends and family!Our second visit was a Sunday evening in late December, right before Christmas, this time with my sister and brother in law. Prior to our visit I tried to call ahead and make reservations. They don't offer that but the woman who answered stated they shouldn't be too busy on a Sunday evening around 8pm. You could imagine my surprise when we were told there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table. After reading numerous Yelp reviews talking about a long wait time, I can not fathom the reason for her saying that.We did wind up being seated a bit earlier than expected (around 20-25 minutes) and were anxious to order. My husband and I wanted to start with the Shrimp Chips. Those were brought promptly along with our drinks, although my sister's beer took a moment. The Shrimp Chips were yummy and like pork rinds. Truly a unique treat.My husband and brother in law both chose the Shogun burgers while I chose the Ronin burger and my sister chose the Kiki burger. Each couple also ordered Parmesan Truffle Fries to share.Our server was kind and attentive but after waiting for our burgers and fries for over 40 minutes, I felt horrible that he had to be the one to keep coming over and apologizing for the wait. It certainly wasn't his fault and although we were very hungry, we of course were not angry with him. At some point, the manager should have been the one to do this and I feel he should have perhaps hooked us up with some extra fries on the house for the long delay. Neither happened.Everyone agreed the food was again delicious and outstanding! It was my first experience ever tasting fois gras (via my husband's burger) and it was divine! I would absolutely return (and plan to) but a few suggestions for Bachi Burger....- start taking reservations, especially for dinner and on weekends- learn to deal with heavy crowds a bit better, maybe via extra staff?- make those mangers do the dirty workThose factors are the only reason both experiences combined equal four stars instead of a full five.

I left wanting to punch Guy Fieri in the face. First off, the small seating area while you're waiting for your table resembles that of a cheap nail salon. Fortunately, the wait was only about 15 minutes. We did wait longer than normal to be greeted by our waiter. For drinks we just stuck to 2 waters...being that a simple unsweetened tea would run us $3 each. I waited-again-for straws, and after the waiter took our order we literally never saw him again until it was time for the check. It was later explained to us by another waiter that our original waiter was \"overwhelmed\". Um, ok...... I ordered the pork belly on the steamed buns and my husband stuck to a simple bbq cheddar and bacon burger. We ordered onion rings and sweet potato fries as our sides. The fries were beyond boring and bland, similar to what I'd get in any simple diner.... any flavor came from the rancid side sauce that came with our serving and it was completely over-powered by orange zest! The onion rings were soaked in oil. I couldn't even pick one up without a fork because my fingers were covered in grease! Gross! Now, despite being disappointed thus far, I still expected great things!Those pork sliders are pretty much burned in my memory forever....and not in a good way. I usually enjoy pork. I wasn't too familiar with pork belly, but I figured that while I expected it to be fatty, I still expected seared, salty crispiness. My very first bite was a full bite of gelatinous fat! Completely disgusted me. No sear, no crisp, just jello meat. The sauces could barely be identified and the described \"cilantro and scallions\" was more like fresh parsley. That's all. You can't fool me! I gave up after the first few bites and mainly picked at the bun. My husband gave it a try and he was turned off by the amount of fat, as well as how soggy it made the bun. The \"asian flare\" just made his burger taste way too sweet. The bacon was floppy, which leads me to believe nothing is cooked properly in this place. It just came across as them combining flavors for the hell of it. Slap gourmet, or fusion on something and people out here are impressed. When we arrived it was very busy and so, SO very loud! But the tables cleared out quickly and yet I noticed a lot of people were still kept waiting. Overall, I would not return.

The entire menu is posted on a chalkboard on the wall inside. We were quickly greeted and seated by the host and our server was prompt about getting us some drinks. The drink menu was fantastic, but the highlight of the menu was seeing Asian fusion inspired cuisine brought to life through the item descriptions. We started off with the Pork Belly sliders. What a delight. Braised pork belly, pickled radish, and a hardboiled egg. Yeah, a hardboiled egg...I know. I thought weird at first until I bit into it. Then as I felt the creaminess from the yolk add in that layer of texture to the rest of the soft and plushy bun with the delicate tenderness of the pork belly and crunchiness from the radish slaw...pure bliss, really. Next came the chili cheese fries. So let me ask you, how do you make your chili better than anyone else's? Bachi Burger will tell you to add oxtail. And I couldn't agree more! Using oxtail added more depth and richness in flavor to the chili and had us all licking the bowl to sop up the rest of what was left. BUT, the highlight of the night was the Shogun burger. This is quite easily the best burger I've ever enjoyed...in all of the land. It's like a super burger consisting of: Waygu grass fed beef, poached Asian pears, pan seared foie gras, mixed greens and a miso butter, between a toasted bun. (What's that you ask?? Did you just read \"foie gras\" on a burger?? Why yes, yes you did.) All I could think about when eating my burger was, \"Hello Bacon, meet your new challenger as Burger's best topping, Foie Gras. Your salty, crunchy smokiness may have just been surpassed by your opponent who offers salty, savory and buttery tenderness.\" The Shogun has certainly raised the bar on burgers, but low and behold, it comes with a price.

\u00a0You haven't left yourself any room to be more raw.\"So, now I am uncomfortable. \u00a0I didn't want to say anything in the first place, but the manager did ask. \u00a0He took the plate away.He came back, with the plate in his hand, and demanded my name. \u00a0He sort of stood there and asked as if he was going to write my name on the wall in the back. \u00a0I was speechless. \u00a0My husband told him his name and demanded to know why I was being asked. \u00a0The manager then said that he had had a discussion with another manager and they \"were concerned that the burger had been half eaten.\" \u00a0I was shocked. \u00a0He started attacking me and demanding to know why I had eaten as much of the burger as I had if I \"really didn't like it\" and that under no circumstances would they refund any money! \u00a0 My husband and I are quite comfortable financially. \u00a0We have been fortunate enough to retire well and early and the last thing I would ever do is to try to scam half a hamburger from someone. \u00a0Moreover, we never asked to get anything for free. \u00a0Now, that doesn't mean I wouldn't expect a decent restaurant to offer. \u00a0 I have sent food back maybe 5 times in my whole life, and each of those times I was offered free food and had to fight to pay for it anyway. \u00a0Most of the time it isn't their fault if I don't like something. \u00a0But, this was different....the food was raw. \u00a0 Even still, we didn't ask for anything for free. \u00a0 My husband was so angry, as was my friend. \u00a0I just wanted to crawl under the table and die. \u00a0This manager is standing there yelling at me for something I haven't done. \u00a0We were ready to walk out, when the manager walked away. \u00a0It was only because of the waiter that we stayed. \u00a0He was so very kind. \u00a0The manager then comes back a little while later and tries to apologize. \u00a0But, in doing so he makes the snarkiest little comment....he says he will take 25% off and he will give me the burger I sent back in a box to go. \u00a0The last thing I wanted was to ever see that burger again. \u00a0It was disgusting. \u00a0My husband said, if he wanted to take 25% off the check as an apology that might satisfy him. \u00a0But, boy was I miserable. \u00a0I have so far been fed terrible raw food, been yelled at for not liking it and then treated like a dog when I was told I should take that food home and eat it later..and why did they still have it? \u00a0 When we were ready to go, I found out the manager had taken a lousy 2.50 off! \u00a0Turns out he meant he would take 25% off the price of the ten dollar disgusting burger, not the whole check as he should have. \u00a0I was vomiting in the bathroom at this time or I would have demanded that we pay the extra $2.50, I don't need his lousy money. \u00a0Oh, yes...I was vomiting in the restroom. \u00a0It is 5 hours later and I am still doubling over from cramps. \u00a0Was it the burger?

This burger was Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, a fried egg, topped with a katsu bbq sauce, miso type dressing and accompanied with a Yuzu citrus aioli. \u00a0This burger is my favorite of the two we tried tonight. \u00a0The burger was super juicy (make sure you get it medium done...only way to go!), the slaw offered a crunchy texture, enhancing the burger, love me some fried eggs in a burger so there's that. \u00a0The sauces really brought the dish together. \u00a0SOOO Good! \u00a0The second burger was got was the Kiki burger also for $11. \u00a0This burger is also made with a juicy patty of Angus beef. \u00a0What enhanced the burger were the sauteed mushrooms: \u00a0Shiitake, Enoki and Eryngii. \u00a0The burger also had caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, onion marmalade, arugula and accompanied with a garlic chili aioli. \u00a0What I noticed right off the bat was the super smokey taste of the burger!!! \u00a0Then you get a sweet kick from the marmalade. \u00a0This burger is packed with different textures: \u00a0crunchy arugula and dense chunks of mushrooms. \u00a0The garlic chili aioli really makes the burger a star, so do forget to use it! \u00a0All these burgers are held together by a Taiwanese sweet bread, super light and fluffy. \u00a0Soo good!So I know my review was super long. \u00a0If you are one of the few folks that reads this entire review and finds it through the 1000+ reviews, I'm hoping that you're mouth is watering like a faucet. \u00a0You NEEED to get your butt down to Bachi burger and try their food. \u00a0This place is absolutely amazing and you will NOT regret it. \u00a0So what are you waiting for?? \u00a0They're open late!!", "Date": "2013-07-28", "Author_Location": "Henderson, NV"}, {"Author": "Connie D.", "ReviewID": "L3-8_gyp4f9DlHyRxVCvow", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Khalbi you're the best!!

But the burgers.. oh their burgers were unlike any burger I've ever tasted. My taste buds were in a state of euphoric shock. The intense flavors made me smile from ear to ear. I can't begin to describe how phenomenal each burger was. The patties themselves were so juicy and each had a glaze on them that tasted fabulous. And the toppings... so good, so fresh. \u00a0The donuts for dessert were great and their watermelon milk tea was easily one the best milk teas I've ever had. Prices here are great. Everything was surprisingly reasonably priced. The service was great as well. Each employee we spoke to loved to talk about their food and told us all about how things are made and so on. Seriously, if I lived in LV I would be a regular here. I know I only visited Bachi once but I'm so ready to call it my all time favorite burger joint. It was amazing.

When in Vegas on vacation I scoured Yelp to find a truly \"local\" eatery that we could visit for lunch with our friends. All the Vegas yelpers and some Honolulu yelpers I know were all wowed by Bachi Burger so I insisted we drive off the strip to eat there.First off the decor is not the greatest, just a dimly lit space with tables and chairs. I don't really care what a place looks like as long as it's clean and the food is great. We were seated quickly and our waiter gave us the run down on popular dishes. I ended up ordering the kalbi burger along with sweet potato fries and a peanut butter chocolate shake. Our food took awhile to come out but as we were catching up with our friends we didn't really care. My Kalbi burger had less flavor than I expected. I think I had it in my head that it was going to be sweeter but the size of the burger was good. With all the ingredients in and on the burger I think I expected it to be a small miracle of flavor bursting into my mouth. Talk about high expectations huh? The sweet potato fries were overcooked and too stringy so I only ate three of them and didn't finish the rest. My peanut butter chocolate shake was $4 and much too sweet. I'm a sweets fiend so if a place offers a peanut butter chocolate shake I am guaranteed going to order it. I think there was too much syrup added to my shake so there wasn't a good balance in the flavors. Sad panda.Our waiter was a really nice guy but one thing which was very odd was that in the middle of our meal he asked us a question from behind the countertop that adjoined our table. It just felt a bit rude, almost like your neighbor listening in on a private conversation and chiming in from behind a fence. I don't think he understood why that was rude, but it's something that could be fixed for future diners. Overall very good service and smiley service.I'm sure many will disagree with me about Bachi Burger, but I really, really wanted to like it! After reading all the stellar reviews I think that I just didn't order the right items for my particular palate. Maybe on my next trip to Vegas we will meet again Bachi Burger and we'll have a redo.

I would end the review there because I refuse to spend more time on this place (and hope that no one else wastes their time either) but I guess this deserves some explanation. Got here a little before 1 PM and was seated with the boyfriend. We were handed menus by a girl who said, \"Uhhh I'll let you have a minute to look this over and then send someone over.\" Uh oh. Already knew that no one had any clue what they were doing and could already tell this was not going to be a good indication of what was to come. 5-10 minutes go by and we haven't even gotten drinks yet - or have been able to order them for that matter. We push our menus to the side and gaze at the workers behind the counter to see if someone is going to wait on us. A guy finally comes by and takes our order after explaining that there was some issue with the computer. Rule #1: The customer doesn't care what is wrong. We are just hungry. Let us order and just apologize quickly for the wait. When I ordered my edamame I physically had to point to the item on the menu since he wasn't sure which of the three I ordered. No, I'm not kidding. 5 minutes after ordering we finally get our drinks - water. Yes it took about 20 minutes to get water. About 5 minutes after that we get our edamame. It doesn't look like the truffle oil and garlic oil edamame I ordered and I ask him if this is the correct one. He says yes and walks off. Well guess what? It wasn't. It was the chili one. I physically pointed to the menu which one I wanted, then ask as it is set down if it is the correct one, and it's not? It's not like there are 100 different edamames on the menu - there are three. Had to get his attention to get us a new batch which came out a lot quicker this time. It was good, but had too much garlic oil that overpowered the truffle oil, and it was way too oily. Each piece was dripping - not too appetizing. The waiter comes by a couple minutes later to give us the sweet potato fries (which were very very good, although I didn't like the sauce too much) to tell us our food is ready but they're waiting on the pickles. WTF? Then he tells us he is going on break and someone else will be covering our table. Right. Food comes out a couple minutes later. The grilled cheese I got was okay, but totally not worth $7. Matt got a Ronin burger which he thought was alright as well but didn't like some of the mix of flavors. The same waiter who I guess didn't go on break comes by and asks us if we want dessert which we say no, and then asks us if we want the check and hands it to us. We walk up to the counter to pay and I hand it to the girl there and say I am going to be paying cash. SHE WALKS OFF. SHE FUCKING WALKS OFF WITH NO EXPLANATION TO GET FOOD AT THE COUNTER. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Our waiter comes by a minute later, my mouth agape and I pay and get out of there. I said in a previous review that Macaroni Grill was the worst service I have ever had, but this takes the cake. I would rather exclusively eat at the Macaroni Grill for the rest of my life than return to Bachi Burger.

The reviews on Yelp made it clear that Bachi Burger had two areas they could improve in: Service and speed. Since I was on my lunch break I didn't have all day to wait for my order, so I asked how long it would take before I even looked at the menu. 10-15 minutes is what I was told by a pretty friendly employee.I decided to get Kiki's Burger, sweet potato fries and a cantaloupe milk tea with boba... Total was a little under $20, isn't Micky D's that's for damn sure! My drink was made immediately and it was so tasty, my first cantaloupe milk tea definitely will not be my last! My food really did take 10-15 minutes. No complaints at all on the service, I was treated respectfully and they got me on my way pretty quickly.Kiki's Burger comes with cheese, two types of mushrooms, bacon, an onion marmalade that was nice and sweet and a sauce on the side that I did not bother with. It was cooked perfectly, medium as I was told they recommended it. What a great combination of flavors! I would absolutely order this again. The real standout was the sweet potato fries though. I shared some with my co-worker because I know how much she likes sweet potato fries and she told me that these were \"Off the hook, best she ever had\". I agree with her.

The pickle sample was really good - only one was hot and the pickled garlic was one of the most interesting on the plate.Besides food, Bachi Burger makes some really interesting drinks like the strawberry jasmine lemonade I had with my dinner.

The Ronin was the favorite of the two he tried, enough that he ordered another to share. \u00a0The cole slaw gave it a nice contrast and bite. \u00a0Whereas the added kim chee to the Kalbi made it different. \u00a0One thing that the Husband thought could be improved was the size of the burger. \u00a0He felt they were a bit small, and one burger won't cut it for a growing man (even with fries).I started off with the Organic Edamame Soybean \"Sauteed with Garlic Butter, Truffle Oil\" ($3) because who doesn't love a little truffle oil in their food. \u00a0It was good, greasy, but definitely yummy! \u00a0It's cooked in garlic butter, and I'm not used to cooking my edamame in any kind of butter!You can't say no to their Truffle Parmesan Fries \"Parmesan Reggiano, Black Truffle Porcini Cream, Sun Dried Tomato Aioli\" ($4). \u00a0It comes in a nice cone with dipping sauce and it had all the kids grabbing some.Another thing they do great is their Sweet Potato Fries \"Crispy Sweet Potato dusted with Sea Salt Yuzu Citrus Aioli\" ($4). \u00a0They are sweet, but salty and the dipping sauce complements it well.The kids loved their Chili Fried Chicken \"Marinated in Ginger, galic, soy sauce.\" ($6) that they ordered a second round.To close out, we ordered the Portuguese Donuts \"Vietnamese Cinnamon, Coffee Gelato\" ($5) with a birthday candle in it. \u00a0(Sometimes restaurants throw in dessert for free when celebrating a birthday, it's not the case here.) \u00a0They were donut holes with lots of cinnamon sugar on it. \u00a0The accompanying gelato didn't taste like coffee much.Service - we got the waiter that everyone talks about. \u00a0He really does try, a bit too hard, and that's where he goes wrong. \u00a0You can't blame the guy for trying, right? \u00a0They could ultimately learn to work as a team though since we definitely had to wave down our waiter for things, and when we tried asking other staff for things, they just passed it on to our waiter. \u00a0Overall, Bachi Burger definitely had some interesting takes on their version of meat between bread.

But what I didn't expect was a walk down memory lane.Service 101 memory lane.1) Always greet the customer when they enter the restaurant. Bachi Burger could really embrace the hipness of the restaurant by shouting out \"Hello\" or \"Goodbye\" when people enter and leave the restaurant. Choose a language. Shout a burger name. Something.BUT DO NO LEAVE THE CUSTOMER STANDING AT THE DOOR UNSURE OF SEATING THEMSELVES OR WAITING.What's sad is that there weren't *busy* at the time and even the manager who was by the door didn't greet me. He was busy making change for someone at the register. I know y'all can multitask and look up for a split second to smile and say, \"Hello! We'll be right with you!\"2) Bus the tables, immediately.It's gross to walk into a restaurant when there's a bunch of dirty tables.Again... the restaurant wasn't busy. In fact the waiter told me, \"Whew! we just got through with the busiest night!\"Great.But just because I came at the end of the rush doesn't mean I should have to sit in a dining room of dirty glassware and dirty tables. When I was showed to my table, the waiter paused at 2 tables before deciding the 3rd table was the winner. I had to laugh out loud because it seemed so disorganized to me. I think he mistook my laughter and explained the other tables hadn't been wiped down. He was very sweet and the poor guy tried to explain his way out of not greeting me and the dirty tables.What really got me was that the waitstaff physically expressed their tiredness from the rush by leaning on tables, stretching in the dining room and squatting to stretch their legs.Hey gang. Do that in the kitchen where the customer can't see you.Better yet, get a move on and get the dining room cleaned up.3) Know the menu.I've never been here so when I ask the waiter what do you recommend and you look at me blankly and say the burgers.... you've totally lost points with me. BURGER is in the name of the restaurant. I KNOW the burgers are supposed to be good. But which one? Why? What's in it? What's your favorite? You're the freakin' expert. You got trained, right?4) Don't sweep the floor in front of me when I'm eating.We're not at McDonald's. 5) Be attentive to your tables and the ones around you. If you're going to help a fellow waiter out, KNOW WHERE THE GUESTS are in their meal. I had a waiter try to take the plates I was eating from three separate times. Really? I'M STILL EATING. You're cute and sweet but go away!Learn to read the table. You don't have to come ask me every 5 minutes if I'm okay. You can tell if I'm okay by walking by the table and observing. If I make eye contact and LOOK like I need you, THEN come over.6) Sense of urgency. Yeah, the rush may be over but there's still work to do. Watching a waiter mull around a dining room is unnerving. It's about as fun as walking into a store and watching the shop girls gossip with each other instead of servicing the customer and getting ready for more customers.Finally... for the food.....I had the Kurobuta sausage appetizer and the sausages were cooked perfectly with a slightly crisp skin that clicked as your teeth pierced through. I could have used more mustard though. The last 2 sausages were eaten dry because there wasn't any more mustard in the dish.The truffle fries were good when the kitchen went heavier on the truffle the second try. Pork belly steam buns were an unusual twist on the peking duck buns. The horseradish sauce was pretty good with it but I particularly liked dipping the sliced boiled egg in it.What was most memorable to me was the cherry yuzu soda. I loved it. It was delicious. I'd come back just for the soda.The potential to be great is totally here. Nice people work here. But they need better training. They don't realize they're doing anything wrong.If I could see and taste past the service, the food is good. But once a guest has a sour taste in her mouth because of the service, it's hard to get past it.I know these guys are new and working out the kinks.

The buns were not overly bready more on the thinner side. The angus beef was tender along and the toppings meshed well together. The only thing I could not locate was the bacon! Where was it, I could taste it but not see it at all! The fries were more than enough for two people to share, which I did with my handsome boyfriend! The chili aioli was okay but to me it did not really go with the fries. I am more of a ranch or ketchup kind of gal when it comes to my fries!

As a result, I didn't taste any shrimp flavor at all. However, this burger didn't lack for overall flavor in the slightest. I also tried my husband's (?) burger and son's Kiki burger. Both were great. We finished the meal with the salted caramel shake with toasted marshmallow topping. I don't care for salted caramel desserts, but this wasn't too salty, so I enjoyed it.

We got the Donuts and Pop Tart for dessert. \u00a0I felt the Portuguese donuts got robbed from the spotlight since the Mocha Ice Cream it came with was quite strong on the palate.I can't really give a proper opinion of the Pop Tart since my North Korean Commie friend took the entire White Chocolate Yuzu Gelato in one bite leaving me with just the heavy port wine cherry flavor and the Pop Tart. \u00a0aRrrr ;(The whole meal was a bit heavy, but well worth it. \u00a0Going to come back with reinforcement to try the other stuff.Verdict: If you love Slidin' Thru, you'll defiantly love Bachi Burgers.Open til 2am!", "Date": "2010-05-14", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Minh D.", "ReviewID": "s20tESdpajCyF8IybjzlOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was reading about this burger place awhile ago and finally got to try it last month in Vegas.

The fear with most ground turkey/chicken burgers is dryness. However Bachi proves that it is not the case. The patty was juicy and delicious. Texturally, it was well balanced with the nice crunch of the onion rings.The pork belly was a melt-in-your-mouth, succulent slice of heaven encased in a wonderfully, fluffy steamed bun.

Asian fusion meets the bun and holy shit does it ever fucking work. My only gripe? Bachi Burger needs a location in LA! Seriously, this place puts all the other burger joints to shame. I mean, this is what Umami Burger should be doing. Bachi Burger is located 5 miles to the southeast of the Strip in a non-descript shopping center. Being the noObs that we were, the wife and I could not figure out which side the entrance was located at (it's on the north side by the way). Once we entered we were lucky enough to be seated because this place was fucking packed. After perusing Yelp reviews, we decided to order the famous oxtail chili cheese fries. All I have to say is thank you Yelp for recommending the oxtail chili cheese fries because they were amazing. The chef is Japanese Hawaiian and the minute you see the fries you will see the Hawaiian influence because there was a perfectly cooked fried egg on top! The portion of the fries was huge. As an appetizer, it could easily be shared with 4 people. Aside from the egg and fries, it consisted of tender oxtail meat, cheese, scallions, jalapenos, sriracha mayo, garlic aioli, chili, and beans. I mean the combination of these ingredients was simply bliss. My wife and I hardly spoke because we were devouring the mountain of fries like fucking barbarians. As for the burgers, my wife had the Kiki Burger and I had the Miyagi Burger. The Kiki Burger was really something. Thick and juicy Angus beef, three different types of mushrooms, caramelized bacon, gruyere cheese, and a sriracha-mayo sauce... oh heaven! As for my Miyagi Burger, it consisted of thick and juicy wagyu meat with furikake (nori flakes), caramelized bacon, crispy onion rings, fried egg and mayo. It was good... a little on the sweet side... let' just say that I liked my wife's burger a little better. Also, if you aren't into fusion burgers, they have a regular Angus burger that you can customize. So, we were unable to finish our meal. Too much fucking food. I can't remember the last time I went to a gourmet burger joint and was unable to finish my burger. I think my only suggestion for Bachi Burger is that they should offer a sampler platter because they have so many unique burgers and it was a shame that I couldn't try more.

Taro was fine, but they said the boba wasn't cooked in the center. My boba seem fine though.@ Truffle Parmesean Fries ($3.50) - Very good and flavorful fries, mainly because of the truffle oil. This reminds me of the awesome truffle fries at ENVY, except a lot cheaper. Probably the best fries to get out of their offerings.@ Garlic Salt & Pepper Fries ($3.50) - Good and flavorful as well. Taste almost identical to the truffle fries, except without the truffles. Just stick with the truffle fries, you'll get a stronger better flavor. One point I have to ding them on is the cone shape containers serving the fries makings it seem like you're getting more than you really are. Cool presentation but not good for my tummy.

Both happy with their burger.@ Peking Duck Steamed Buns + Pork Belly Steamed Buns ($8.50) - One person in our group decided to split the orders, so he got to try 1 of each item. This item reminds me in Vegas. Calling something Asian fusion and charging up the wazu for it. This is literally 2 buns with meat in it. Literally. You can get comparable items at Diamond bakery for a $1.25 each, a boba drink at Volcano Tea, and a banh mi sandwich at Hue Thai for a little more than the cost of this item and that would fill you up. \u00a0Sure you get a hard boiled egg and I get some salad, but thats still some crazy markup. Either charge less for this item, or give some more value for this item. This is more of an appetizer than an entree. @ Portuguese Donuts w/ Vietnamese Cinnamon + Coffee Gelato ($4) - This is donut holes with cinnamon and a side of coffee ice cream. So Portuguese donuts is a type of donut. But WTF is Vietnamese cinnamon? The waitress said its just cinnamon and it sure is. The donuts were okay (like you have to try to make a donut taste bad), but stuff at Ronalds taste a lot better. The coffee gelato ice cream is just okay as well. I guess they wanted to take a twist on coffee and donuts.@ Cherry Glazed Pop Tart w/ Gelato ($4) - Pop Tart? I think everyone has memories of those Kellogs Pop Tarts you toast into a toaster as a child. Well now that we're all grown up and more sophisticated, we have a restaurant pop tart. The combo of the pop tart and gelato is good. Has a good flakey crust. Definitely something to order if you don't want a coffee based desert. \u00a0 Service is very friendly. They ensure that everything is good and ask if you need anything. When the kitchen got backed up, the waitress did acknowledge this and apologized.The wait time is a little ridiculous. I don't expect fast food times, but 30 mins is a little ridiculous. Then another 20 minutes for desert. The kitchen got backed up, but how do you get backed up with only 2 table orders? I can imagine how bad it might get when this place gets filled up to a higher occupancy rate. \u00a0New restaurants are traditionally understaffed, but surprising this place seem overstaff . On a Friday night, you have 4 waitresses, with only 6 tables with patrons. Over staff at the front of the house much? It seems like there was 1 person solely just making boba drinks, but I saw the waiters making the drinks as well. Then you have another person who looks to be manning the cashier and not doing much. Then you have the overseeing owner or manager taking care of paperwork. With all of these people \"busy\", you have 2 cooks in the kitchen. Maybe they need to devote more staff to getting the food out in a timely fashion, instead of doing damage control towards its patron for the long wait.The food is good no doubt. But pricing on some items is questionable. Just because something is Asian Fusion or you give it a fancy name, doesn't mean you can charge more for it. They have a friendly staff, but they also need to work on getting food out in a more timely fashion.

If I didn't eat at Holsteins a couple days prior, I would probably give Bachi Burger 5 stars. But in a head to head competition between Holsteins' Rising Sun burger and BB's Ronin burger, I'd have to give the edge to the Rising Sun... but not by much.The Ronin burger ($9 - caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, sweet bun, yuzu citrus aioli on the side) wasn't as sweet as I was expecting, which let the savoriness of the beef shine. The other star was the onions, which provided most of the sweetness I tasted, along with the dressing and BBQ sauce. It's a messy burger after biting into the egg so prepare to use a few napkins. Even with all the ingredients it was a compact burger that held up well after each bite. There were no issues with stuff sliding out the back and falling apart, as can be the case with other burgers with a million ingredients.One area where Bachi Burger beats Holsteins is with their fries. They're excellent and highly addictive. Truffle parmesan fries ($4) topped with parmesan reggiano, black truffle, chives, a light gravy drizzled on top and a side of sun dried tomato aioli.They also have an interesting array of non-alcoholic drinks. The jasmine strawberry lemonade ($3.75) I tried was like 3/4 lemonade and 1/4 strawberry slushy on top. Not only was it a great looking drink, the light floral flavor mixed with fruit was incredibly refreshing.I should have ended the meal there. Instead I ordered one of their specials... an ice cream sandwich ($4) - vanilla ice cream and house-made whipped cream between two chocolate cookies. The cookie was soft, but not soft enough. When I tried to cut into it all the ice cream and whipped cream came shooting out the back. The cookie tasted decent enough, but as a whole the dessert wasn't in the same ballpark as the rest of the meal.Despite that dessert, this place is highly recommended. It's a great bargain when you consider going to a similar (or inferior) burger joint on the Strip will cost you an extra $10-15 more per person.", "Date": "2011-06-11", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Russ V.", "ReviewID": "kLyjSEvl01H6xIR1GvDODQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Las Vegas WEEKLY Magazine had an article on Burgers..

I sort of avoided eating it... weird I know since it defeats the purpose of having chili on this dish. I decided to get the Pork Belly buns. Sort of pricy, but pork belly tends to be expensive.

The Miyagi San was enormous, with its bacon and onion rings in the burger. I preferred the Ronin. I completely loved the Taiwanese buns they used...so soft and tasty. They're made at a local bakery several miles away. Though these gourmet Asian fusion burgers can be a bit on the pricey side (similar to Umami Burger), they're well worth it.

The condiments used on my smokie mountain burger sounded interesting on paper, but turned out to be a mess. \u00a0Condiments used (heirloom tomatoes, truffle butter, what resembled caramelized onions, and some other ingredients I didn't find memorable) weren't balanced and gave the burger an overwhelmingly undistinguished mush of sweet flavors and mismatched textures. \u00a0Flavor of the otherwise bland patty was overwhelmed entirely.The bun is more brioche-like. \u00a0It's nice and holds the burger well, but I felt was a tad hard in texture. \u00a0There was also more bread than I would have liked, so I opted to eat it open faced instead.Overall this wasn't the worst burger I've had, but certainly not my favorite by quite a bit.'Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries' were to die for. \u00a0This is where I felt Bach did a great job, using \u00a0their succulent minced oxtail, covered with jalapeno peppers, beans, (cheddar?) cheese, fried egg, mixed over a mound of fries. \u00a0Flavors here are very robust and well paired together. \u00a0The oxtail offers the most prominent flavor, but it's complemented well by the beans, peppers, and fries. \u00a0The flavors felt very Vietnamese to me. \u00a0Fries used are similar to a McDonald's cut. \u00a0They are quite crispy and light. \u00a0Seasoning used is minimal and they're good by themselves, The absurdly large portion size was another wonderful bonus. \u00a0I felt it resembled more like a super decadent poutine dish. \u00a0Highly recommended. \u00a082%Looking back, I feel Bachi is capable of delivering some very solid ideas and cooking, but it isn't always consistent. \u00a0I doubt I could ever enjoy their burgers if no changes are made, but that's not to say they don't offer some other great choices.Not bad", "Date": "2011-08-12", "Author_Location": "Beverly Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "Mike H.", "ReviewID": "HQ_XfRkj3N4ov2URPAvayA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bachi Burger can be really good; then again, sometimes it isn't.

The oxtail chili cheese fries were my next favorite. . .though it came a VERY close second to the foie gras. \u00a0The fries were golden and crispy, and very soft and fluffy on the inside. \u00a0The oxtail was so tender and almost melted in my mouth. \u00a0I don't like beans in my chili but I did not mind the beans in this chili. \u00a0It gave it a nice, creamy texture to the crunchy fries that was different from the gooey cheese. \u00a0The jalapenos were crisp and gave each bite a little heat, which offset the slightly sweet and salty chili, and the cilantro kept my mouth feeling fresh and clean. \u00a0Oh god, it was pure heaven. . .BH and I cleaned the plate and eagerly awaited our burgers.BH's Kiki burger was pretty good. \u00a0I am not a big fan of mushrooms but his was very flavorful, the meat was perfectly cooked (we ordered medium rare. . .the meat was browned on the outside and pink THROUGHOUT the entire patty!) the bacon strips were candied, sweet, and chewy, and the bun was soft and pillowy. \u00a0BH commented that the bread reminded him of cha shu bao - asian style where it's very light and fluffy, golden brown on top and just a tad sweet. \u00a0I agreed and felt the bun really made their burgers.My Ronin burger was just okay. \u00a0I was a little disappointed that it lacked a bit of flavor, imo, but I think it may have been because I had foie gras and oxtail chili cheese fries before the Ronin, so my palate might've been built up to expect something more. However, I think if they put bacon in the Ronin, it'd made it even better than it already is. \u00a0But I think if I had the Ronin without all the luscious apps, I would've thought it was perfect. \u00a0The meat, like the KiKi, was cooked medium rare, it was juicy with the soft, golden bun and the fried egg. . .it was a true delight to eat. \u00a0BH and I could tell they also put a lot of thought and time into their sauces, which came out very interesting and paired well with the burgers and fries.The truffle parmesan fries were really good as well. \u00a0Like the oxtail french fries, they were crisp, golden brown, and had a nice, subtle flavor of white truffle with a bit of tangy parmesan. \u00a0It went with our burgers quite well.I was so impressed with the meal, I flagged down our waitress and begged her to talk to the owner so they could open a Bachi in LA. \u00a0She said the owner is in the works and is hopefully opening one by the end of next year! \u00a0I nearly jumped for joy. \u00a0She also mentioned that the chef/owner used to work at Roy's Hawaiian and just started Bachi. \u00a0They plan on opening a ramen house in a few months, also in Vegas. \u00a0Ramen is abundant in LA, but I feel we have a lack of great burgers, especially Asian fusion burgers. \u00a0Overall, I felt the burgers were like a combo of Umami (in terms of creativity and presentation) + Bun Bun (for the Asian- fusion style flavor). \u00a0Bot Bachi blows both out of the water. . .by far. The bill was just a little under $50. \u00a0BH exclaimed that it \"wasn't right\" because he felt he was somehow cheating them. \u00a0$50 for 5 dishes. . .each made with such precision and skill as a $$$$ restaurant??? \u00a0It was the best meal EVER. \u00a0I understand prices in LA might be a bit more, but I don't care. \u00a0I just want my Bachi!!!", "Date": "2011-12-14", "Author_Location": "San Marino, CA"}, {"Author": "Jen C.", "ReviewID": "mkytrlNZ_oqJkduy4idCUg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Oh Bachi Booboo, you are a delight!Nestled in a strip mall off Windmill (my location of choice), you find a petite but happy lil place.

And Bachi Burger is serving up a unique burger experience.I'd seen a number of of the over 1,000 photos posted on Yelp, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to order before we stepped in the door. FOOD:Between three of us, we ordered Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, Kiki's Burger, and a Black and Green burger. All three were excellent. The high quality meat was cooked properly and was sandwiched in a a slightly greasy bun. \u00a0The star here is the flavor combinations they create with their burgers. Wow. You will pay for it (our bill came to around $65), but these were thoughtful, creative, and flavorful burgers. I see now that I should have gone for the more adventurous burgers. I can get blue cheese on a burger anywhere. Where else can I get Lup Cheong Sausage or Japanese eggplant on a burger? \u00a0Other places might have some of the same ingredients on their burgers, but I cannot imagine them doing it with as much style and creativity as the folks at BB are. I had a well crafted burger. If I'm going to pay more than $7 for a burger, I need something beyond what a Bobby flay recipe can offer me. I need an experience!They prepare their onion rings they way I like them: sliced thin with a light batter. I didn't dare ask for ranch and betray my lack of sophistication whilst eating my $14 burger. But that is the only thing that would have made the onion rings better.We also had fries, a house made soda (the Lychee was entirely too sweet), and the red velvet shake. Hubby fell in love with the creamy shake. SERVICE: Our server was a professional. This was a busy night and he (like all of the wait staff) was taking orders, serving, and busing. With all of that, he never let our drinks get too low and he checked on us a number of times during the meal. There was a gentlemen there who seemed to be a manager who was keeping an eye on the speed of service and the table turnover. I like seeing that level of care given to providing efficient service.

\u00a0That was the question I sought to answer when I stepped into this southeastern joint with my sister visiting from out of town and two other friends. \u00a0Beginning with an appetizer: Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries \"garnished\" with a sunny side up egg...let that concept wrinkle your brain for a minute,Portion is definitely worthy of sharing with 4. \u00a0 Shaq would have better luck winning a game of Jenga than my attempting to eat this with one's hands without making a hot mess. \u00a0 Armed with forks, we broke the egg all across the beautiful pastiche of crisp golden fries, hearty oxtail chili, and luscious gooey cheese that harmonized in a beautiful symphony of texture and flavor. \u00a0The hardest part was deciding on burgers, so we each agreed to order a distinct burger and cut them into quarters for all to sample. \u00a0Although the waiter suggested we order them medium, I think we chose wisely with medium rare.Burger #1 The RoninIn the movie Ronin, when DeNiro's character is asked about how he avoids an ambush, he replies \"Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt.\" \u00a0When I glanced at the description and read the reviews of my trusty Yelpers on what appears to be the gold standard of the Bachi Burgers, I had no doubts this one was going to be a winner. \u00a0Perfectly cooked patty topped with some nuttiness from miso-goma dressing, tanginess from Katsu bbq sauce, crunch from the Japanese slaw, binded together with the runny yolk of a fried egg and then slathered with a citrus-yuzu aioli, if you haven't started drooling on your keyboard, perhaps you need to get your salivary glands checked out.Burger #2 The Kalbi BurgerSomewhat of a misnormer since they use ground beef and pork rather than the marbly beef short rib from which its name sake is inspired, but nonetheless well executed. \u00a0Along with a korean-inspired mayo, green onions, and a healthy punch of kimchee, the flavor profile is great although I would have preferred a stronger spice component with hotter chili paste. \u00a0Nice touch with a banchan accompaniment of spicy korean pickles.Burger #3 \"The Crusty Crab's replacement\"Can't recall the name of this one since it was one of the specials and is supposed to be the replacement for The Crusty Crab, which was essentially a crabcake sandwich, but this one is like a Steak Oscar between two pieces of bread so I'll temporarily call it the Krabby patty, in honor of Spongebob Squarepants. \u00a0Beef patty topped with crab, scallop, a fried egg, and some crispy vegetable component that has slipped my mind, Plankton would gladly hatch a scheme to serve this burger to compete with the Krusty Krabs. \u00a0 Burger #4 Spicy Miso BurgerHighlights include Angus beef, roasted garlic, apple vinaigrette (side note: totally would have missed this word in a spelling bee because of that sneaky extra i), and shishito peppers. \u00a0This one was like the cute girl next door standing alongside the other three supermodels of burgers. \u00a0Nothing to complain about, but not much of a revelation either. \u00a0The finely shredded lettuce has a propensity to lose its crunch amongst the liquid components without providing any added flavors like a spicy arugula. \u00a0Don't be intimidated by the name, as shishito peppers are not considered anywhere close to spicy as its other Asian cousins in Chinese or Thai cuisine...not really sure if I could even make it out, which probably relates to the final point: the apple vinaigrette overpowers the other mild components so that you don't get the popping off of distinct flavors as in the other burgers.In summary, the patties were well seasoned and sufficiently moist, the brioche-like bun is probably personal preference since it is soft and heavy as opposed to light and toasty (reminds me of the baked pork buns at dim sum), although I would have to say the Ronin comes closest to living up to Barney Stinson's highest compliment for any budding burger connoisseur: \u00a0\"I love this burger so much I wanna sew my ass shut!\"", "Date": "2011-08-28", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Ricky A.", "ReviewID": "DFqEZwG06aTqg1CUG7Cqpw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been to this location and the one near the theater with the unfinished parking lot and this one is noticeably better.had a nice revelation with the oxtail fries and the ronin burger was just what the doctor ordered.really enjoyed the menu offerings but one knock was the lack of shrimp chips because apparently they stopped serving them.bring back the kropek!", "Date": "2013-01-18", "Author_Location": "San Diego, CA"}, {"Author": "Patrick D.", "ReviewID": "riYPUmPx6XoeBwNWKI11KA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's not a burger joint...So said a friend of mine. \u00a0Is she high?

With Asian-inspired burgers, house-made Japanese pickles, and boba milk teas alongside delicate salads, truffle fries, and Portugese donuts, it appears the chef is a bit scatter-brained, but almost all of his creations are well-balanced and skillfully executed.The juicy burgers are served on grilled sweet rolls - a unique approach. The more creative burgers are better than the plain versions, though I wasn't crazy about 'The Crusty Crab.' The sweet chutney was quite tasty, but there wasn't enough textural complexity so the soft crab cake and soft bun ended up tasting mushy in tandem. I really enjoyed 'Kiki's Burger' with saut\u00e9ed Shiitake &amp; Eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon and sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, and a garlic chili aioli on the side ($8, pictured above), as well as 'The Lonely Bird,' made from ground chicken and turkey topped with herb pesto, lettuce, tomato, and onion ($7.50). I'm not sure about soy alongside pesto (soy is in all the burgers), but the patty was juicier than most beefless burgers I've had.The salads are light and fresh, though they are a little too upscale for a burger joint and therefore fairly expensive for their size. The oriental chicken salad with organic jidori chicken breast was my favorite ($9), but maybe that's just because it went better with the theme of the restaurant. I love the Japanese pickles that change regularly, and for $3 they make the perfect amuse. The garlic butter and truffle edamame ($3) and crispy sweet potato fries with yuzu citrus aioli ($4) are worth ordering, but pass on the shrimp toasts which are more interesting on paper than on a plate.Once Bachi Burger refines a few of their menu items and improves the vibe of the space, I believe it will become very successful.

He described it as melting in your mouth flavors. I had a bite but guess I didn't take a big enough one bc I didn't have the same reaction.

We cut both burgers in half and enjoyed a variety of different flavors. Te two side dishes we chose were Parmesan and sweet potato fries. By the end of the meal there was not one stitch of food left in sight. I even finished my sweet mango milk tea boba. The hours of this place are great for any schedule so don't hesitate to drop by after work. If a big dinner or a late night snack isn't your forte, they have plenty of beers to suit all of your needs. While I think it would be convenient if they had a bar area, the tables are just as good a place to 'hang out'. I can't think of a single thing about this place that didn't deserve 5 stars.

A good friend had recommended this place for me when I was staying at the Sun Coast early in the trip and never found time or anybody who wanted to go, so when I was in Henderson, was excited to find they had a location close by. When we got there, there were a bunch of people already sitting in the small waiting area, so I walked up and put us down on the list and he told us probably 45mins to an 1hr. I looked around, saw a few empty tables and was perplexed?!?!? He said we could sit at the bar, but it was completely packed (not like he didn't know that fact). I mean I felt like he was just f-ing with me for the sake of f-ing with me. This was kind of confirmed when the guy after us (also a party of 2) queried why people weren't being seated yet, to which the host replied by looking down at the clipboard and telling him something along the lines of, \"It says you came at X time and I said 45 mins from then, so...\" I was like WOW, did he really say that? Naturally, that party of 2 immediately walked out.We finally got seated, think it was actually only a 30-35 minute wait. The food was excellent! Started off with a hazelnut brown ale, which was $10 for a larger bottle. It was okay, but not some kind of amazing beer. But beer is a necessity of life, so it goes...Ironically, my least favorite item from what we ordered were the oxtail chili fries everybody raves about here. It had no 'wow' factor to me and grossly overpriced IMHO. The Black and Green burger I got was VERY tasty! Wow, great flavors in this one. The waygu beef was cooked perfectly and loved the combination of items they had: roasted garlic, sauteed mushrooms, spinach, bacon, topped off with argula! I typically like to try different things, but if I come back here, I may just have to get this same burger. Loved it THAT much :) Also had one of her steamed pork belly buns and it was great too, but having had homemade steamed buns all my life, it wasn't as exciting for me. I made the tragic mistake of dipping it in the Hoisin sauce, which I know I don't like AT ALL, but for some unknown reason I went ahead and dipped it in anyways. Luckily, I overcame that bite and finished off my beer and had a nice end to the meal.Service was a little slow and our server was a bit awkward socially, which was funny at first, because I was still a little medicated. But after awhile, it became a bit tiresome. He was full of effort though, so points for that and he was young, so giving him the benefit of the doubt. Get the Black & Green!

Bada** beers (Honey Wheat, Sam Adams Cherry, as well as the Japanese staples). Priced around $5 a beer that seems about right. We dined for lunch so I tried a Mango milk tea. It was alright. It took like 15 minutes to show up, but again that gets back to those new restaurant service kinks. Grilled cheese - I read Keith's review but stupidly ordered it anyways. It's overpriced ($7) and wasn't special. There's all these yummy gourmet ingredients but honestly the sandwich had the taste/texture/consistency of a white cheddar grilled cheese sandwich. I think they need to work on this dish a bit. Bachi wagyu burger (5 oz for $9). I enjoyed the subtle bbq sauce they added to the burger. The bun was delicious and soft. They had tons of unique burger options but we stuck with the classic. It was a nice take on the classic cheeseburger. The 5 oz size is absolutely perfect. You feel full but not disgusting after eating it! They didn't ask us how we liked it cooked - mb next time we'll specify medium.

Management with excellent customer service skills? Good job.Wow... I can't express the disappointment that myself and my friends experienced at this place. It should also be stated that I KNEW I was walking into a fusion restaurant, and I was expecting a different take on burgers - but I wasn't expecting a sugar rush or an upset too-much-sweets stomach from a burger for lunch.We arrived for lunch, having driven quite a ways away from the strip (which is FINE if you want to drive; we didn't mind at the time. But if you're looking for a good burger and you're visiting Las Vegas, staying on the strip? Just eat somewhere down there, really), and we were starving. This place busy, but not full; having said that, it took quite a bit of time to get seated in comparison to other restaurants that were just as busy during our trip, and yet seated us sooner. When we were seated, it then took quite a while for someone to pay attention to us long enough to take our order - they seemed very impatient and annoyed with questions about the menu, or any of the three of us being indecisive. They were very much non-engaging, as well, if that makes sense - it didn't feel as though they gave a hoot whatsoever that we were there, spending our money at their business.The items that we all settled on:Peking Style Duck Steamed Buns - These were the only thing I really liked about the meal. They were a new, interesting version of steamed buns; since I'm in LOVE with steamed buns and any form of dim sum, I liked the different take on this dish.Spicy Miso BurgerBlack and Green BurgerKiki's Burger - this is what I ordered. I can honestly say that, along with the other people at my table, all I remember was how OVER POWERINGLY SWEET THIS THING WAS. Seriously. Sure, it was juicy and tender meat, but you couldn't even taste the meat itself because it was drenched in whatever marinade/sauce they use. For being told this was THE place to go for excellent burgers, I must say... not so excellent, unless you want a sugar high and have no interest in the burger itself. HOWEVER, the burger buns were divine and fluffy. Very nice touch, but would have been a nicer touch on a burger worth eating. If their quality of meat is sooooo great and wonderful, then they shouldn't hose them down with so much sauce that they kill the flavor of such \"quality\" meat.Truffle Parmesan Fries - these were so unimpressive. It tasted like they took powdered brown mushroom gravy out of a packet, is the comment my partner said. On top of that, the overly sweetened mush burgers were enough food to have just skipped the fries altogether.Taro boba was bland, I've definitely had better for a lesser price; my partner remarked that the thai tea was kind of dull, too.We had a few other things, but I don't recall EVERYTHING that was on our table... none of it was good enough to really remember, except for the neat steamed \"buns\" and how fluffy the burger buns were.In the end, our incredibly disappointing experience came out to $70-ish, and it should have been under $50 for what we felt we got out of it. The whole place seemed pretentious and snooty, especially for a restaurant specializing in burgers. The attitude (or lack of one, since they hardly cared to pay attention to us) of the service, the ridiculous marinade/sauced burger patties, and the overall disappointment is NOT worth recommending this place to others - at least, not from my point of view.To top it all off, we had reservations at a restaurant that night that we were all very excited for, but within 20 minutes of leaving, two out of three stomachs were so soured from the sugar burgers that we had to cancel our dinner plans, and actually just return to our hotel rooms for a nap!", "Date": "2012-01-31", "Author_Location": "Sparks, NV"}, {"Author": "Jeff B.", "ReviewID": "ytZjQ04ZubNZr2SJ29f3yg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "(First off, I am giving this place a 4 star rating because I can't give it 3.5 stars which is what it really deserves.)Parking: The main entrance is in the rear and there is no handicapped parking close.WiFi: WiFi was iffy for Windows users. I suspect that this is a MAC snob establishment and not an issue for MAC users.Noise Level: There is no noise dampening in the whole place, hence you can hear everyone and everything. The noise made it difficult to converse, even over a two-top.No Booths: While not having booths may be convenient for employees to put together for large groups it is not comfortable for others. Personally I prefer a booth. Having only tables presented a unique situation for me; I have a hat and cane. I have a hat because it covers my balding head and the cane because I like to walk, but where do you put them at a two-top? The unfortunate answer is you put them on the floor.D\u00e9cor: The wall decor was lacking. They claim to want to showcase works from local artists, but it would seem that $2000 photos were the focus. Too few to be interesting, but the ones they did have were really big (not very good, just big). Maybe it is better at night.Going Green: Want to be green, use cloth napkins for both dining and the moist nap after the meal. Also, offering a hot, moist napkin after the meal would be very classy. Cloth napkins also add a touch of class.Place Mats: The place mats are \"natural\" and have a texture. They are uncomfortable to put your arms on. But when the staff was clearing the table nearby, they just wiped then off. The staff did not clean the sauce that had spilled into the mat. The mats should have been replaced. I am left to wonder what was still in my mat.Table Setup: Each table has a salt pot instead of a shaker. I am wondering where the wooden spoon has been... There is no black pepper on the table, but a service of a \"chili water\" (WAY hot), and what I was told was \"Japanese Pepper\" that seemed to be some sort of pepper powder (again, spicy). Also a ceramic holder of toothpicks was on the table. What on the menu would I need toothpicks at the table for?Service: We were greeted multiple times within seconds of walking in and seated promptly. All service oriented portions of the experience were done in a timely manner. However we had to remind the waitress to serve our fries and we were asked 3 times if we wanted dessert, annoying.Ordering: You order everything a la carte. When you order a \"Bachi Burger\" for $6.00 get you the burger, nothing else. You then order your sides all separately and they all come separately. This a la carte ordering seems to be a trend around town, I have seen it before and I am not a fan. When the order comes and there are all these separate plates and serving vessels and glasses the table gets crowed really easily. In the fries all come with some sort of dipping sauce, but with everything on the table it can be hard to get to some times. When you see a burger on a large white plate with nothing else, it looks rather sad. Sure it highlights the fabulous burger, but it also point out how small it is.The Food: My wife and I both ordered the Bachi Burger, it was lunch and that is all we wanted. The 5 oz. Angus burger was cooked correctly to medium (although I ordered medium rare) and the bun and fixings were correctly assembled. The burger tasted great and did not fall apart (believe me when I tell you this is an issue in the world of burgers). My wife also ordered the Sweet Potato Fries which we would come back for again. I ordered the Garlic Salt and Pepper Fries that came with a curiously strong Aioli that I would have loved to put on my burger. We both ordered sodas that were great (again, my wife's pick of the Mandarin Orange was the winner.)I would have loved to have had all this on one plate; it felt so hodge podge it made for a slightly uncomfortable eating experience. Honestly, it should be: Pick you burger, add a sauce, pick your fries and other sides and give it at one price based on the burger. Put it all on one plate and dress it well. Other Thoughts: 5 ounces is not a 1/3 pound burger and most other places around doing good burgers are doing either 1/3 to \u00a01/2 pound burgers, so again I felt a bit short changed. Surely adding an ounce would put you up to snuff. The potato fries are cut too thin. I am hoping you are using fresh fries and not frozen bagged fries just dressed up, but in any case the fries are nice and crunchy but there is not enough fluffy potato within. Your Sweet Potato Fries are thicker and better cut (Hmm... me thinks kicked up US Foods).This is dining at a level that wants to be fine, but without that stodginess. I can get behind that but there needs to be a slight rethinking of the menu and very minor changes to the environment with the dining area. What is has left me with is \"Pricey Burger Place\" that I will go to again in a few months to see if they have fine tuned the experience.", "Date": "2010-06-15", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Gusto E.", "ReviewID": "TeBpCqsu27psCj-Ay6QIcQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My older brother put me up on this spot.

I was worried about the previous reviews about the service. But we had no problems. Our server was awesome! It was about 9:30p and the place was half full. I wish I remembered the name of our server, he seemed so happy and passionate about his job! And gave us recommendations and whatnot.So we started off with the truffle fries and I got the Kiki Burger, the BF got the Ronin, and our friends got a ronin, kiki, and a traditional burger. And the bf got some kind of lemonade thing, can't remember what it was, but it was good!Fries came out pretty quick and they were gone in less than a minute! yummy stuff. The burgers did take quite a while. But the server did come by to check on us, so at least we weren't ignored. What sucked was that our burgers didn't all come out together. So some started grubbing before others cause we were starving and didn't want the food to go cold!LOVED the kiki burger. Something about the sweet bun, it makes the burger. The flavors lived in happy harmony. Oh and the dipping sauce, interesting flavor.

Only reason I am going with 3 stars is they had really good burgers , loved the fries but my burger was not so hot. Otherwise it would have gotten a 4 or 5 star. I got the Kiki burger . We were told the chef prefers medium which I went yay its what I prefer. So I got mine medium and the guys got theirs medium rare and medium. Let me warn you. Medium is not or at least for the person cooking that night a light pink. It was a lot closer to medium rare. Almost redish pink all the way through. I couldn't wait to try it since I adore mushrooms and a good mushroom burger. Its one of my favorite three things in the world to eat. My friend ate here all the time and just raved about it so I figured it had to be good. When I cut the burger in half to start eating it I took a bite and went omg I can't eat it, it tastes almost raw. We called the server over told them it was to rare and found out that's what was considered medium here. So I asked for a medium well. While the guys ate their burgers. (both graciously offered to wait for mine to be made which I said no eat) I munched on the fries we ordered. Sweet potato fries probably one of the two best I have ever had. Yummy dipping sauce, crunchy on the outside and creamy middle. The truffle fries .... all I can say is so good and addictive. Salt and Pepper ate one but had to stop due to the peppers on it. :( \u00a0After a few minutes my burger came back out and much to my shock it was the same burger cut in half with a bite missing where I had taken a bite. Not wanting to cause issues I shrugged and ate it. Now i am sure had it not been cut in half it would have been wonderful (and less icky thinking of it going back on the grill and back onto my plate) not just good.

Perfect, we thought, as Bachi Burger Windmill opens at 12 PM on Sunday. We thought wrong. An estimated 40-50 minute wait until the time to be seated. There were about 3 groups before us taking all the seating inside so we waited outside. It would have been great if there were chairs outside.Seated after a 30 minutes, so still less than the anticipated wait. We were starving, and placed our food orders and drink orders as soon as the waitress arrived. The atmosphere was clean and cool; a small dig with wooden chairs and tables, echoing the Japanese flavors of the food.Boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Guava Milkshake and Kalbi Burger. I ordered the Boba Almond Milk Tea and after a hefty debate in my head between the No Meat Here Burger and Kiki's Burger, Kiki's won. We shared Truffle Parmesan Fries.Our fries and drink arrived first. My almond boba milk tea was good and refreshing; nothing to rave too much about. Boyfriend's strawberry guava milkshake was sweet and a little too heavy for me on the ice cream, but he quite enjoyed it. The truffle fries are another story; crispy and not too oily, the black truffle porcini and parmesan roggiano went well with the potatoes. The sun dried aioli was a delicious condiment to the fries.Our burgers arrived about 20 minutes after our drinks, along with a steak knife to cut into them haha. I was completely ravenous at this point, unfulfilled with just fries and milk tea, so I wanted to scarf my burger down but I resisted. I truly enjoyed every aspect of my burger. The shiitake, enoki, and eryngii mushrooms, sweet caramelized bacon, gruyere cheese...heavenly. I didn't use too much of the garlic aioli sauce on my burger as the flavors of the burger were enough.Boyfriend's kalbi burger was good; I think he enjoyed it more than the sample bite he gave me though haha.We left with half of my burger and a quarter of his burger in a doggy bag.

Poured over the reviews and decided that this place was going to be my cheat meal. So the next day we drove over to some strip mall.My boyfriend and I sat down. Nice big place. Lots of tables, photos of Japan, kinda dark for ambiance. For starters we ordered the pork belly buns and a couple of beers. I think one reserve is if a place is going to be semi-gastropub with classy burgers and some microbrews, then THE WAITER SHOULD BE ABLE TO EDUCATE US ABOUT THE BEER. I asked him how the honey wheat was and he said it was from some company and I said, \"But yeah, how does it taste\" and luckily my boyfriend had compared it to another beer. The waiter clearly stammered, but I'm a dick because he and I are brewers and we just wanted to see what his view was.Anyway, the steamed buns came. There was pork belly, a bit of cilantro and scallion, a small slice or radish and quail egg. I loved it! If I can't go to Momofuku, I'll settle for this. Honestly, the egg was totally insignificant and I could have done without it. It's already rich from the pork belly. The belly was was tasty. Very tender and melted in my mouth!After I ordered the Kiki's Burger with Truffle Parmesan Fries. On man, enoki mushrooms, Gruyere, onion jam, and bacon? I loved how nothing overpowered anything and I can taste all of its components. \u00a0The Truffle fries were so decadent as well and I loved how you got the whole cone.

Here's my take:What I recommend: If you love blue cheese as much as I do, go with the Black & Green. I have no idea why they don't call it the Black & Blue. I ordered medium rare and it was delicious! It's a great burger. The burger patty if flavorful in itself, but with the mushrooms, bacon and spinach- I enjoyed it very much. One thing that I really liked about the Black & Blue is that the burger is not overwhelmed with the blue cheese. I would say it's in every other bite. Pretty smart if you ask me. Be sure to get the Parmesan garlic fries. Wash it down with a good beer. You'll be glad you did. If blue cheese is not for you, try the kiki burger.

Since then, I've gone back a bunch of times and every time the food has been delicious (It makes me sad to see that some yelpers had bad experiences 'cause I just can't imagine it).I've tried a variety of burgers and appetizers now. You really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The flavors are delectable, and it's all so unique. I would have to say my favorite burger is the Kalbi burger--I order it without kimchi though. Fabulous flavors from the meat to the sauce that they put on it. I've also had the Banh Mi Burger, the Ronin, and a couple more I can't recall right now. Again, I can't think of a single thing to complain about any of them. Everyone should try the oxtail chili cheese fries, though. I know the name can be intimidating to some who aren't adventurous in their food experiences, but it is so delicious! The meat part reminds me of bbq pulled pork, but it has a kick to it that makes it a little spicy. On top of thinly cut fries and a fried egg, this app is amazing. The fries, whichever way you get them, are good. Thin cut, so there's a bit of crunch to them. The other appetizer I've had was the Bachi Pickles. From my understanding, it changes almost day to day because it just depends on what vegetables the chef felt like pickling the night before. It was very different and interesting. I liked most of them, but I wouldn't say it's the dish for everyone.Almost every time I've gone, I've ordered the jasmine milk tea with boba to drink. It's so delicious. I wouldn't say the boba is amazing, but it's decent for a restaurant. I just love that milk tea. It's very floral, though, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone that doesn't like very flowery tasting tea.Finally, the servers have always been really nice. The wait time has gone up since it's aired on Triple D, of course, but it's never really that bad. It's almost a coin flip.

I guess one could describe it as a Asian-American fusion restaurant. Most of their dishes have obvious Asian influences, from wasabi mayo, kim-chi toppings, to Japanese style BBQ sauce.Each item is served ala-carte, burgers (which range from $8-$13, with one or two premium ones in the $20+ range) do not come with fries though I definitely think ordering them is worth it.The first time I went, I ordered a Kiki burger ($12) along with the Truffle fries ($3). The burger was excellent. The caramelized bacon melted in my mouth, and the unique lemon aioli that accompanies the burger really brought out some of the flavors of the meat. The fries were also good, thin cut fries topped with some a truffle reduction sauce. I would recommend sharing as a single order of fries is sufficient for two.Bachi also offers traditional fare for less adventurous eaters. One can order a simple BBQ burger, or build their own from an assortment of their toppings. I recommend a tleast trying one of their specialties. Lastly, the service was acceptable and the decor was minimalist. There are no booths in the restaurant, just tables which can seat 2 or 4. The idea of 'less is more' definitely works here as the restaurant does not seemed clutter at all.

The restaurant was about half full, but there was no space large enough for our group. We waited about 20-30 minutes before a table was cleared. Since we had to wait for a table we already knew what we wanted to order when we were sat.Our server was pretty nice and relatively attentive. The Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries with garlic aioli and fried egg was delicious! The chili was pretty tasty and I loved the fresh cilantro and jalapeno slices the fries were garnished with. The portion is pretty big so sharing this is a good idea. The other fries were also pretty good, nothing particularly outstanding, but good enough.I decided to go with the Kalibi Burger (Angus beef, kalbi marinade, house made kimchi, green onions, and ko chu jang mayo) because I love Korean food and Korean flavors. This burger was delicious. I asked for my burger medium, and while it was a little more of a medium rare, it was well seasoned and juicy. The house made kimchi was pretty good and the ko chu jang mayo was tasty, too. The burger also came with a little side of kimchi style cucumbers, which were delicious. I would totally get this again.Two of my friends decided to go with the Shogun Burger (Waygu beef, unagi, poached asian pear, pan seared foie gras, miso butter, yamamomo peach). This was delicious, and it better be for $25. All the flavors married really well together and made this burger really tasty. Both who ordered it were very satisfied. I had a bite of the Ronin Burger (Angus beef, caramelized onions, Japanese cole slaw, miso goma dressing, fried egg, katsu BBQ, yuzu citrus aioli), which was pretty tasty, as was Kiki's Burger (Angus beef, saut\u00e9ed shiitake, enoki and eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli), which was also pretty tasty.For dessert we ordered the Portuguese Donuts with Coffee Gelato after seeing a picture of it posted at the entrance of the restaurant. I think it looked better in the picture than it tasted. The donuts were a little doughy and dense. I liked the coffee gelato, but I mean, it was coffee gelato. The Mandarin Orange Tangerine Soda was pretty tasty. The Katsushiro (alcoholic) was also pretty good, according to the bachelorette. Overall, I thought Bachi Burger was pretty tasty.

Alright?! Case in point, I ordered the Ronin burger instead of the Kiki burger. Should've been a no-brainer because Kiki had garlic and Ronin didn't. ARGH! oh well....So, someone said that this was on Diners Drive Ins & Dives and I didn't believe them, because this is neither a dive, nor is it tiny as hell. It's like an average sized burger joint -- not quite Red Robin, but like a smaller Smashburger or Five Guys. And well, the prices...they're average with a gourmet burger place $9-$10, unless you get the Shogun. DUCK STEAMED BUNSSo, these were pretty decent. They're served on steamed buns, but folded into like a small taco (steamed bun is about the size of a drink coaster). Flavor was sort of a sweet, soy, teriyaki kind of flavor, but the seasoning was pretty good. RONIN BURGERIt's got Miso dressing, Katsu BBQ, and a fried egg, amongst some others. You know why I know I was drunk? I would never order a burger with Miso anything! I like miso, but not outside Japanese food, and especially not on a burger.Luckily for me, the miso is hard to taste, and as for the fried egg, I don't understand what the novelty is. Among the very light and almost hard to find flavors the patty was not seasoned enough, giving to a very lackluster performance. The flavors were enough that you can taste that they're not absent, but it's not enough to really notice. It did have a small sweet and salty persuasion, but again, nothing worth mentioning.SHOGUN BURGERWhenever I try a new joint (especially if it's hyped), I assume that I'll never come back. I make sure to order as much on the menu as possible. This guy was eyeing me the whole time. $25 burger! So, feeling very generous, and drunk (it's Vegas!), I ordered one for the table. I split it into 8ths and gave a piece to everyone. Most thought it wasn't much better, but I thought it was definitely better than the Ronin.It's not just beef, it's Wagyu Beef! And on top of that, there's Unagi and Foie Gras! It's also got peach and miso butter (can't escape miso tonight I guess (Vegas?)). The beef is noticeably more tender, and the flavors and seasoning are better. Now, I don't think I actually got any unagi in my bite, so I'm a little disappointed, yet the thought of fishy eel next to beef is a little worrisome. The sweetness this times comes from a little unagi sauce, which worked ok. There were certainly improvements in this burger over the Ronin, but not $15's worth!BADCHI BURGEROk, my friends all picked on me because I was the only one that thought Bachi was less than orgasmic. I don't know, maybe I'm not all about the \"gourmet\" burger, but I feel like lately everyone's so worried about their toppings, they keep forgetting about the beef. Sure it's Angus, sure it's Waygyu, but that doesn't mean you don't have to season it or cook it properly! The patty isn't just filler protein, it's the main event! So, if you've never had it, fine, quell your curiosity. Otherwise, just go to In-n-Out.Everyone's tastes are different, so here're some of my references (not in any order):NOT A FAN: Fatburger, Five Guys, Tom & Eddies, Kuma's CornerFAN: In-n-Out, Paradise Pup, Smashburger", "Date": "2012-08-13", "Author_Location": "Hoffman Estates, IL"}, {"Author": "Monica K.", "ReviewID": "7a5Ncpo-1qSIdzf51SIPjA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Came to this place with my boyfriend (who now lives in Vegas) and he told me that this place is delicious.

Anyhow, as for as the burger I decided to try a specialty of theirs. The \"Banh-mi\" burger (I think that how it was spelled...don't remember). I have to say that this burger was flavorful and simple. Not your average ketchup burger either. It had this asian twist to it with the picked carrots on the side and a side of which I think is a light fish sauce dipping sauce. As for the fries there were about 4-5 opinions to choose from I picked the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Comes in the silver ice cream cone looking thing. the truffles on top of the fries were interesting and has the consistency of cooked mushrooms.

After leaving for school, I had a list of places I had to go to at least once before I left again - one of which was Bachi Burger.My friends' never having been was the perfect excuse to go. Badgering them at eleven in the morning, my friends were dismayed at the fact that the burgers and fries were separate. Regardless, we ordered the Parmesan Truffle fries as well as the Sweet Potato. The former are always a good standby with the sundried tomato aioli on the side. The latter were delicious on their own, but the Yuzu citrus aioli didn't mesh as well. My three friends ordered the Kiki burger after asking for my suggestion while I ordered the Crusty Crab protein style. I've never had an issue with long waits for food like other reviewers have. The food came out quickly, and we began devouring. My friends loved the bun, but one of them complained that the flavor of the burger only hit midway through. My \"burger\" was a crab cake atop lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion, garnished with a Tarragon Remoulade and mango chutney. It was tasty, a bit on the salty side. Yet, it was a disaster to eat. It fell apart after a bite, and attempting to get all of the accoutrements in one bite proved a challenge.As for service, one of my friends commented that she felt the need to beat them down in the nicest way possible. Our waters were constantly refilled without the need to pull out the \"I'm dying of thirst\" look at the staff. Our plates were cleared out before we could react. It was definitely the epitome of attentive. Overall, good food and service makes for a happy Diana.

You eat that oxtail and you can't even tell it is even ox. It just melts away in your mouth. If you saw all of us eating this dish you would think we were a pack of wild animals. In a blink of an eye it was all gone. It was just that good.I tried the Ronin and the Kiki's Burger and they were excellent! There is so much going on with each burger. Each one gives unique flavors in every bite. You get something sweet, something salty, bitter, citrus, soft, crunchy... savor every bite because once it is gone you'll be wanting more.My friends got the Shogun Burger and he wouldn't share it with anyone. It was worth $25 so I can understand why, but man I wish I had a chance to taste that perfect looking burger.

It was a bit of a drive for me, but hey~ they're open until 1am! Definitely worth the drive because this place is going green & sell local art that they have as decor :) They also have a flat screen tv by one entrance & a lounge/couch area right by the restroom by the other entrance.I wanted to try the mango or honeydew boba, but the server said that they were powdered flavors :/ I ended up getting the green milk tea with boba & that worked just fine.I ordered Kiki's burger; sauteed shitake with mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili with aioli on the side. This burger was awesome~ everything about the description made it sound great, & it was! The buns for the burgers are sweet, definitely a good size portion because all of my buddies know that I'm a slow eater.I ate half of the burger to save room for dessert; Portuguese donuts that had Vietnamese cinnamon & coffee gelato. This really hit my sweet tooth & I'm not a super sweets kinda person, so I let my boyfriend inhale most of the donuts while I ate most of the coffee gelato :9 The service was good, since they are still a new restaurant I noticed that once in a while another employee would be shadowing &/or supervising the server.

Upon entering at 4:45 pm, there was no host for several minutes. The entire staff seemed very confused and \u00a0uncoordinated. \u00a0When a host finally showed up, we were told it would be a few minutes despite there being several open tables in sight. After being seated, we sat for 10 minutes with no one even making eye contact with us. I finally physically flagged a waiter down & asked for menus. He replied with \"yeah\"? and when I asked for the menu he gave them to us & walked away. No apology, no anything. After another 15 minutes of being completely ignored, we got up & left. When we left, their waiting area was packed with very unhappy looking people waiting to be seated, \u00a0There were still lots of tables available, but no one getting served. \u00a0We went 10 minutes down the road & had a fantastic dinner with excellent service at a tapas restaurant.

I understand that they are trying to be creative with their Asian fused food. Great concept, however, some times a little too much can be a bad thing. Overall the place was ok but not what I was expecting. I suggest this place if you want a nice atmosphere and finger foods, not if you're terribly hungry or if you have several mouths to feed since everything is a la carte. If on a budget, stick to Fukuburger.First comment- nice interior and atmosphere. Steady flow of people. Employees were nice. Even though there were other patrons, we seemed to wait a long time for our food. I believe we waited at least 20 mins to get our food and another 15 mins for the check. I mean for a burger this seems like a long time plus there seemed to be a quite a few employees in the back that it shouldn't have taken this long. Second - the food. We ordered the parm fries, Ronin burger and Short rib steam buns. Parm fries were good however I didn't feel that the sun-dried tomato aioli really fit in with the fries. If anything I would suggest that the truffle sauce replace the aioli because the sauces didn't go well in my opinion. Also I didn't think the aioli had much flavor considering it was sun-dried tomato. The Ronin was just ok. First I'm surprised they didn't ask us how we wanted it cooked. It came out medium well and honestly I would have preferred it a little more pink. First off, the burger in my opinion is quite small and tries to compensate with a thick patty but still looked delicious that I couldn't wait to take a bite. First bite, bread is soft and great quality of meat but the sauce tends to overpower the flavor of the rest of the ingredients. If you asked me I wouldn't have been able to tell you that there was Japanese Cole Slaw, an egg, caramelized onions or a miso dressing, all I could taste was the katsu sauce. There were 2 sauces on the burger and a citrus aioli on the side. Personally I don't think the aioli or the miso dressing are needed since the katsu sauce is powerful enough by itself.Short rib steam buns - great presentation making it look like pitas. However, first impression was that's alot of dough for the little bit of ingredients within it. First bite is exactly what happened. I thought that the short rib and the egg didn't have enough flavor to overshadow the thickness of the dough. I could taste the cliantro but other than that, I thought the flavor was very bland. I tried the dipping sauce which was suppose to be a horseradish aioli. Personally I wasn't a fan of it, I would have preferred something with a little more zing like a wasabi ranch dressing or a japanese style salsa. It's a great concept but I think it should be revamped to bring out the flavors of the ingredients they try to fuse together or else again everything gets lost in what is trying to be accomplished.Finally we ordered the Portguese doughnuts. Eh it was just an oversprinkled cinnamon mini-doughnut with a mini vanilla ice cream scoop. It tasted a little burnt and seems to be covered with alot of cinnamon and brown sugar to hide the burnt taste. Overall Bachi was just ok, it didn't meet the expectations that I had or maybe I had too high expectations. For two people we spent over $40 and still left hungry so I wouldn't recommend this place if you are starving. Again I like the concept and what they are trying to achieve but for the price I can get the same thing at Fukuburger.", "Date": "2010-12-09", "Author_Location": "Portland, OR"}, {"Author": "Michele W.", "ReviewID": "H4odRXTdGQWvkbrr_EurzQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Japanese take on Burgers.Small industrial space in a generic strip mall next to a subway, this place has a very simple design inside.

Especially after trying it's tasty neighbor, Miko Izakaya, our curiousity peaked even more. On a random Friday afternoon while on the hunt for something tasty and new to kickstart the weekend, I checked out my Yelp app to see what food-talk was blowing up and lo and behold, it was Bachi Burger. It's an easy location to spot from the street, but the actual door can be a little tricky to find. Once inside, the simple elegance of the asian-influenced decor, homey ambience, and general mood of the place evoked a familiar feeling I couldn't quite put my finger on. I realized, after taking a look at the menu, the reason was because the food is an ingenious blend of hawaiian/asian/pacific island flavors with the never-failing, good ol' american burgers. The burgers themselves are fantastic for all the non-typical reasons \u00a0usually makes food fantastic-in-a-weird-only-in-Vegas way. They're just the right portion, not too big and doesn't come all-you-can-eat, everything in it is made in-house, even down to the bun, and they don't skimp on ingredients to cut down on cost. Don't get me wrong, I love all those typical Vegas places too, where you can have multiple steak and egg plates for less than $10. But Bachi Burger is kind of like that special girl that comes along only once (maybe twice) in your life and you want to treat her right, where it's the quality of the experience(s) that matters most. My boyfriend got the Kiki burger, their most popular one, and I got the Bachi Burger with ground angus. They also have a steak burger, a galbi-rib inspired burger, and a banh-mi burger to name a few of the most memorable. My burger was made to perfection, and by the look on his face and how quickly he ate it, I'm sure the Kiki burger was equally delectable. In addition to the amazing list of burgers, there's boba drinks, exotic soda drinks, eco/trade/small business-friendly coffees, and a small but powerfully tasty army of sides, salads, and dipping sauces. Our favorite side was the parmesan fries with truffle oil with an amazing aioli dipping sauce I couldn't quite discern. We also tried the yam (aka sweet potato) fries that had a tangy dipping sauce that complemented the fries perfectly. Also, if you're a fan of appetizers, try the chili-garlic-ginger soybeans or the fried chicken pieces. \u00a0The fried chicken was so good my boyfriend ate them so fast I hardly had time to try a bite!", "Date": "2010-05-11", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Lisa K.", "ReviewID": "xpRTWowzeaTofsXmsfAI_w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went to Bachi Burger for lunch on Monday, and it was so good, I felt I needed to update my review for themFrom when we ordered to getting the food, it was 15 minutes EXACT.

Sat aroung for 15 mins, looked around and some people waited for about 15 mins and still didnt get water and have orders taken. Others looked like they have been waiting for a while to get thier orders...How long does it take to cook a hamburger, its not an elaborate meal or anything. So food finally came and we were not impressed. -Salt and Pepper fries: man they smelled soo good but soft, soggy fries are hard to over look expecially when they look store bought. -Wagyu burger: the plate looked very poor in presentation, a $10 burger with the add ons should look a little nicer, a burger in the middle of a plate with nothing else looks dinky, maybe leave it open faced with side sauces or fries to fill space for presentation. Ronin Burger: It was ok, nothing to write home to mom about, the meat tatsed the same as the Wagyu one though. Asked for our check and took forever that to come as well. Seems like the servers take the order and just hang out at the food window instead of walk around and give refills or give any kind of service at all. Overall, this dont not impress at all.

If you have ever had L&L BBQ Beef... imagine that in-between 2 pieces of a sweet bun. I guess the salty-sweet thing kinda works. I won't get it again. 2 stars.Ronin Burger - Better. There is a lot going on in this burger. The slaw and miso dressing were tasty. The Yuzu Citrus Aioli gave a little horseradish that killed some of the sweetness. That worked well. The egg got lost in everything going on in this burger, I didn't even taste it. 3-stars.Bachi Fish - Good. I'm not a real fish person but this worked for me. It's simplicity is what was good for me. One of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had. Kiki's Burger - Best. I've ordered this several occasions. If you're a mushroom lover... you'll love it. The marmalade mixed with the salty cheese is a flavor explosion. I highly suggest accompanying this burger with sweet potato fries. The Truffle Parmesan Fries needs more of the Aioli on top of it.

A nice mix of Japanese veggies that calmed the appetite but didn't fill us up. I've had both the Ronin with beef and with the chicken patty (for reduced guilt.) I loved it with both, awesome flavor combo. The fries are special. Truffle parmesan is spectacular, sweet potato not far behind.Beware the hard sell on the drink menu, both alcoholic and non.

Ever since this place has been on tv, people flock to it. Also, if you're staying on the LV strip, taking a cab here will cost you about $20.We started with the Chili Fried Chicken. It was perfectly fried, without too much excess batter, and the sauce was spicy, salty, and a little sweet. You could definitely taste the garlic. The cabbage that came with our appetizer also gave it some good texture to contrast the relatively soft chicken. Two thumbs up.I ordered Kiki's burger, and my fiance ordered the \"Banh-Mi\" burger with a fried egg on top. When we saw everyone else's burgers come out, we assumed we'd be full after an appetizer and a burger. We were right. Anyway, the Kiki's burger melted in my mouth, and I really enjoyed a new take on a bacon-mushroom cheesburger. My fiance's Banh-Mi burger was so interesting! You could actually taste the shrimp in the patty, which also contained beef and pork. The herbs and pickled vegetables were tasty, but be careful, because the aioli and the sauce together can get very spicy. Our waitress was very friendly, as was the young man who refilled our waters. They each said, \"please, thank you, yes ma'am, yes sir, etc.,\" and they were very helpful anytime we had a question about the menu.

It's way off the strip, about 5 miles so make sure you're willing to drive or take a cab. I heard it was also on one of those food network shows so it's getting more popular by the minute. When we got there around 1pm on a Saturday afternoon, there were groups of people chilling in the parking lot. I was prepared to wait a little bit but it was kinda insane, since we ended waiting probably about an hour and a half. We had a larger party of 6. So maybe that's the reason. But this place is not very big. They also advertised another location but not sure where that one is located. I def recommend smaller groups visiting or coming right when it opens to avoid the tortuous wait. Anyways finally was seated and got to order. Food takes about 15-20 minutes to come out so I recommend getting fries to tide you over. Unfortunately I didn't get a say and someone said yeah, bring everything at one time (instead of staggered or when ready). So I continued to starve a little longer (given it was almost like 3pm now and I had not eaten since dinner/5pm the previous day). This was a bad idea as I proceeded to scarf down my food super fast when it came to the table and my stomach was not feeling all that great about halfway through my burger. At least that's what I choose to believe over something was wrong with the food (ie contaminated or worse). I tried the Kiki's burger with mushrooms, onions, bacon and cheese. It was pretty darn good. And this is really an eat your burger with a fork and knife kind of place. Yeah the burgers are huge. Not sure how I could fit that thing into my mouth. As for the sides, for our big group we tried the oxtail chili cheese fries and the truffle fries. I love oxtail but was a little disappointed with these fries because I couldn't really taste the oxtail in it. It really just tasted like regular chili cheese fries to me but with an egg on top that made it slightly better. Since it was split up between a bunch of it, I only got to have a little bit so I may have to give it another try next time I'm in town. The truffle fries were really good though and I liked the truffle sauce they have on top. Didn't care too much for the sauce on the side - it's not totally needed IMO. Overall a pretty pricey meal. Burgers start at $10 and go up including the $26 fois gras burger. And the chilli cheese fries were like $11 with the truffle fries at about $4. My share with the gratuity charge they tack on with large groups was $20. Good thing I can only come every once in a while when I'm in Vegas.

If you're looking for a fun and unusual gourmet burger experience, this place is it. We first ate here in 2010 and loved the experience, and had to come back - each burger or sandwich we try is even better than the last. One thing that impresses me about the food here is the obvious care and attention placed on the ingredients and preparation. Even something as \"simple\" as the Bachi Pickle Assortment (just $3, be sure to try it) has been house made with extreme attention to detail and flavor. When you spend 15 minutes trying to puzzle out the umami of a pickle plate, you know you're in a great restaurant.Two stand-out out burgers are the Ronin ($8) and the KiKi ($8). The Ronin has carmelized onions, Japanese slaw, Miso Goma Dressing, Kastu BBQ and Yuzy Citrus Aioli, all topped off with a fried egg. The Kiki is dressed with a garlic chili aoli and comes topped with caramelized bacon (so amazing), sauteed shitake, enoki & eryngi mushrooms, a sweet onion marmalade and melty Gruyere cheese. Burgers always arrive perfectly cooked, but just BE SURE to ask for medium rare or they'll cook them past medium - and these burgers SHINE at medium rare.It's a bit of a bummer that the burgers don't come with plain fries - you have to order those on the side ($3) but the gourmet fries, such as the Truffle Parmesan ($4) are totally worth the extra cost - smothered in Parmesan Reggiano, black truffle Porcini cream, and sun dried tomato aioli, they're a must-not-miss side item.The Pork Belly Steamed Buns & the That's Cheesy sammies are also \u00a0outstanding. You really can't go wrong with anything you'd order here.I also appreciate their amazing drink offerings - \u00a0lovely boba drinks & shakes, incredible sodas (love the apple lychee, calamansi lime & cherry yuzu) and really great teas, such as the Mugi-Cha Barley Tea. \u00a0If you like coffee, try the Hawaiian Sea Salt Coffee, it's fantastic.The only negative comment I have is I do have to agree with other Yelpers regarding the service; it is slow and sometimes disorganized; don't be surprised if you have to wait to be seated, then wait to have your order taken, then wait for your food .... but just order a lovely dessert special and some coffee; at least that will take your mind off the long wait for the bill.", "Date": "2011-11-10", "Author_Location": "Portland, OR"}, {"Author": "Dred H.", "ReviewID": "xsfsOuC9hpIXdygWK0qXHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I effin' love this place. \u00a0Kalbi burger? \u00a0Yes please.You guys need to open one of these in Chicago. \u00a0I will be at your door the day you open, like a hungry, hungry stalker.", "Date": "2010-10-22", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Jason P.", "ReviewID": "ZzRDZzKO5Lqyjq95W4olqw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty cool placeSolid 4 stars, I was hoping it would be a 5 but maybe I need to try another burger next time.

However, on a more recent visit, I dined in with my husband and infant (brought him in with his car seat) and totally forgot about the sucky service! The host walked us to our table and kindly brought over a high chair for my baby. He then flipped it upside down and said for us to place baby's car seat on there. My husband and I didn't agree with putting out baby (or his car seat) on the bottom of the dirty high chair where it's been dragging all over the ground. So I asked if we can just have another chair AND the response he gave me was baffling! He said, \"So you're OK with putting your baby on a chair where he can fall?!?!\" Yes, you'r damn skippy, I gave him the dirtiest look AND he was lucky I kept my mouth shut. I replied, \"yes and smiled (while doing whatever possible to put my baby's car seat on the chair the safest way possible).\" Seriously, am I that stupid to just put an unsteady car seat on a chair.

Me and my buddy made a mistake in chowing this down first. A few points, its absolutely delicious, the chili tasted great, theres a friend egg on top and some cilantro, and some sort of mayonaisse based sauce. The fries were crispy, just wonderful, but yeah just make sure there's 3-4 of you to share, or you'll fall asleep after eating this. Pork Belly Buns:These bun taco type psuedo-sandwiches are popular nowadays. (I've tried the one at momofuku in NYC, so that was the benchmark). Tasted very good, not at the momofuku level, but very well prepared. The pork belly was well flavored, tender and the dryness of the sliced egg really balanced the sweetness and fat of the pork belly. \u00a0The portion is a little small but these really should be appetizers.Ronin BurgerProbably the best burger you will try, the meat can be either angus or wagyu (similar to Kobe Beef) if you have the wallet. Honestly you can't go wrong either way because the meat quality is excellent. I asked for Medium Rare and it came back closer to the rare end, which is perfect. It is literally steak tartarte in the center. Well flavored, can't say enough great things. The bun was like Hawaiian sweet rolls (Taiwanese bread).Only downside is, with all the money they are making they should invest in a better ventilation system, cause all the smoke from the kitchen made it difficult to see the other end of the restaurant, but all in all a must visit.

SO good. he sauces that go with both of them really complement the fries well. the Salt and pepper is definitely my favorite, since it has more spice and kick with the jalapenos and the sauce. Two orders of fries fed 7 girls well, so it's pretty well portioned here.While many of my friends got Kiki's burger, and the Ronin, I got the Kalbi burger, mostly because of my love for kimchi. It's extremely tasty and ridiculously filling to the point of 'Oh my I'm TOO full...but it's so good!\" Kalbi ground \u00a0beef, kimchi, onions, a massive burger roll, and spicy cucumbers on the side. For someone who loves Korean Food, this definitely impressed me.

Bachi Burger failed to impress me the first time I was here almost 2 years ago. I was staying with a friend the other day who lived nearby and we decided to go here for a late night dinner.I was extremely happy I decided to give this place another try. The food is amazing and the service was excellent. My buddy already went back last night to pick up food to go. I ordered the truffled parmasean garlic fries and the Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. My friend ordered the Chili Fried Chicken and Kiki's Burger. No complaints about any of the food. I was surprised at how good the Fried Chicken was. I wasn't a fan of the sauce served with the fries, but not a big deal.The reason I don't give them 5 stars just yet is I'm still a bit disappointed in the length of time it takes for the food to come out when there is nobody else in the restaurant. It was much quicker than the first time I went (took 50 minutes then). But I guess good food is worth waiting for. Also, I still think they could improve the atmosphere of the place a bit. It still feels like a strange cross between a fast food joint and a sit down restaurant when they could be so much more. With food that good its a shame they are not busy all the time. Maybe it's the location, maybe its the atmosphere... I'm not sure.Anyway, I look forward to going back to try more delicious burgers! Hopefully I can bump this up to 5 stars in the future. Another plus was that the manager had reached out to me and apologized for my poor experience the first time around.

Most recently, I tried the Vegetarian-friendly NO MEAT HERE... \"BURGER\" and it was good. It wasn't amazing (like their other burgers), but the fact that they had a well-constructed and thoughtful dish for Vegetarians was awesome enough for me. It featured a shiitake mushroom patty, Japanese eggplant, tofu, red bean, mixed greens, and chili lime vinaigrette on a wheat bun. Pretty cool. I also LOVE their TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES and SALT & PEPPER GARLIC FRIES. The toppings are amazing and the aiolis are addicting (especially that Garlic Chili Aioli, drool). The other burgers I've enjoyed several times are the RONIN BURGER, KIKI'S BURGER, and SPICY MISO BURGER. Serious drool action all over the board. I've had the OXTAIL CHILI CHEESE FRIES once and they're pretty amazing too. Basically, I haven't had anything bad. I do enjoy the boba milk tea drinks as well. They're not the best boba drinks, but decent for a craving. The BACHI SAKE SANGRIA is really great too and unassuming.The SHOGUN BURGER is really great! Loved the pan-seared foie gras and although I couldn't distinguish the Yamamomo Peach and Asian Pear really well, it added a nice sweetness to this rich sandwich. The Wagyu Beef was delicious as well. The Unagi seemed unnecessary though; it didn't add anything significant for me - taste or texture - and it kind of took away from the two main ingredients (Wagyu and Foie Gras). I also tried the SWEET POTATO FRIES for the first time along with my two favorite staples and it was okay. I liked the freshness and it not being salty, but with other amazing fry options, this doesn't come close.We did have one bad customer service experience where we ended up leaving without dinner and going to another restaurant. It was a rather busy night (and I'm sure they have lots of those) and the communication with seating availability was horrendous. Especially since I had called ahead. There was lack of organization and the gentleman that appeared to be the manager poorly handled the situation. It was really disappointing. Very \"off-putting\" and since I'm a regular, it wasn't a complete deterrent, however, for my friends, it was bad enough to not warrant another visit. Not a way you want to lose customers! Otherwise, the service is just okay. Which is a real shame with food so delicious.Update: I haven't visited this location for over a year because of my last experience.

The kalbi burger was topped with kimchee and tasted like a korean bbq meal in a bun. However, for me, the bahn mi burger really stole the show and may just be my favorite choice so far. Burgers are inherently greasy and meaty and, although this burger accomplishes that \"essence,\" it also managed to be really light and clean on the palate and brought through all of the herbal and fresh flavors of a traditional bahn mi sandwich. Seriously, the bahn mi is bomb-ass.

Confirming with her question, she gave her suggestion and what is considered the most popular three burgers on the menu. The Ronin, Kikis, and Banh-Mi burger is supposedly the most popular and preferable. My girlfriend ordered the Kikis and I ordered the Banh-Mi. I normally like my meat cooked in medium rare, however, the server suggested that we cook it to medium well because our patties are more than just beef. My patty consisted of shrimp and pork so medium rare would be overdoing these meats. So my girlfriend and I took her advice.We waited about 20-30 minutes for our burger. Though busy, that is quite long. Finally after waiting, our burgers and one serving of \"just fries\" came. My burger was good but not great. I have definitely tried much better. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this unique style of burger. On the other hand, my girlfriend's Kiki's burger was delicious. It could use more veggies and more dressing but the meat combined with the bacon was stellar. Overall, an OK experience.

In my past review, I gave it a 3 star. Today, I am going simple. BBQ Bachi Burger, medium, sweet potato fries, and chicken kara-age.Like the last time, despite the fact that there were 3 wait staff, the service was somewhat slower than at many other restaurants. 3 times, I had to flag the wait staff down to ask for things. -1 star for slow service.The Chicken Kara-age came first, average portion for $6. The visual was not what I expected, the kara-age very dark in color and not the golden brown I'm used to seeing, so immediately, I was a bit skeptical. However, it turned out to be pretty good. The color is dark because they seem to marinade the chicken some type of Teriyaki type sauce which is giving it not only the dark color, but a sweet, salty taste as you bite in. It comes with some sort of chili mayo dip which has some kick to it. Not Bad.The sweet potato fries and the burger came together. The swee potato fries is one of the best I have had so far. Very tasty. It is sprinkled with what they say is a Kaffir Lime Hawaiian Salt (OK, I never would have known if it was not on the menu) and ground peppers. The sweetness of the potato, the salt, and the pepper gives a nice balance of taste. The yuzu citrus aioli gives you an option of adding a bit of citrus taste to the combo.The BBQ Bachi burger was awesome. Done perfectly to medium, with tons of juices flowing. The slight sweetness of the bun goes well with the BBQ burger. By the way BBQ is not the tangy type of BBQ sauce, but rather more the soy type like a Teriyaki BBQ.

We first arrived, the front area was packed. It was about a 10-15 minute wait. There was nowhere to stand or sit inside, so waited outside. The man told us he would come and get us when our table was ready. No one came for us so my husband went in to check to see how much longer the wait was and they just happened to be calling his name (they said they were going to come and get us, so I don't know why they were calling his name). The front area definitely needs to be managed better and set up differently. It seems way too small.The server was nice but she seemed like she was overly busy. She wasn't very attentive at all. Her mind seemed to be elsewhere. We ordered our drinks and it took her a while to get them back to us. My husband was annoyed because his beer wasn't cold and the glasses weren't frosted (when she told us they were). The glasses were like shot glasses. I've never seen a beer glass so small. Is that the new thing? Maybe I'm out of the loop, lol. The food was good but nothing I was amazed by. We ordered a side of fries for our son and we loved the pineapple ketchup it came with. That was yummy. We also started off with the oxtail chili fries. My husband really enjoyed them, me not so much. They were too spicy for me because of the jalape\u00f1os and I was also wondering where the oxtail meat was? There was also barely any beans. The fries were a bit overcooked too for my liking. Some of them were way too crunchy. Also, when the fries first arrived at our table, the egg was already broken. That's no fun! For our entrees, we split the Peking Duck Steamed buns and the Ronin burger. The duck buns were very good with the hoisin sauce. The buns were steamed perfectly and the fried egg mimicked cheese. They were definitely delicious. I'd like to try the pork belly buns. The biggest disappointment of the night was the Ronin burger. We would have been extremely satisfied if they cooked it medium like we requested. The burger came out well done. They cooked the angus beef way too much. We don't like sending food back so we just ate it as is. However, we did let the waitress know that they overcooked it. The flavors of the burger were delicious though. If they cooked it medium then it would have been great. The cole slaw, fried egg, onions, and aioli had a great taste. The bun was also grilled a bit too much. The decor was cool but there was a big eyesore out on the front deck of the restaurant. There is a pile of old cooking equipment outside which makes it look really unprofessional. At the end of our meal, we felt like we were being rushed out by the waitress. My husband wasn't even finished his beer and the waitress came over asking if we needed the credit card settled. We hadn't even gave her a credit card so I don't know why she thought that. Her mind was definitely lost.

And for the most part, flavor profiles are retained throughout the various cuisines. The Kalbi burger evokes Korean BBQ and Kimchi, and the Bahn-Mi burger tastes like the sandwich. What makes the burger special, however, is the texture profile. Unlike Umami burger, there is a light crunch on the outside due to a combination of caramelization and maillard, the same found on top-end steaks.

When I pointed out that this burger had Kim Chee, which she likes, she gave it a try. \u00a0This burger is loaded with flavor. \u00a0It has sweeter flavors from the teryaki offset with sharper flavors of onion and garlic. \u00a0The Kim Chee offers a nice crunch. \u00a0This is my wife's favorite burger.Spicy Miso: \u00a0This burger is loaded with flavors. \u00a0The egg is a real addition to the spicyness and meld of teryaki and onion. \u00a0This is probably my favorite so far.Bachi Fish: \u00a0If you want to go a little lighter, the fish sandwich is outstanding. \u00a0Again, lots for flavors that meld. \u00a0The fish says it is pan seared but looked like it was fried. \u00a0But not too greasy and not overcooked.All sandwiches are between 9 and 14 dollars and are ala carte. \u00a0So with two burgers and an order of fries, enough for my wife and I, total will come to about $30 including tax and tip. \u00a0While it might sound like a bit much for a burger, the flavors make it a bargain.On the drink menu is an impressive list of some of the best beers on the market. \u00a0Based on that, I imagine the Saki is good, too. \u00a0But I haven't tried either. \u00a0Either will add about $10 onto your bill. \u00a0I guess I'm a little too cheap to go the extra distance.So ingore all the BMW and Lexus machines out front and enjoy the food.", "Date": "2012-02-16", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Jonathan C.", "ReviewID": "GzhCn9xq-INfaqFHzpHSwQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this place!

After seeing this yummy burger spot featured so many times on Food Network & Cooking Channel shows I finally got to experience it...TWICE in one weekend! :DI wasn't planning on eating a \"dirty\" meal our first night we got to Vegas since I wanted to still look somewhat lean for the Olympia Expo (cuz everybody that attends that convention and show is just shredded to the max and I can't go in lookin' like a flabby chump) but I ended up fasting for over 22 hours and I needed a place to eat STAT! So I ended up here, at Bachi, alone since the SBBF had his own team dinner to attend.I didn't have to wait long to be seated even during their busiest dinner hour (7-8pm). Once I was seated I knew exactly what I wanted for my appetizer to start, the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries of course! I love the fact that the table of 6 seated right next to me ordered the same appetizer, but for their entire table. And I loved it even more when my fries came out and I literally devoured that ish like a BEAST and I could tell that party of 6 were either horrified watching, or completely entertained. As I was scarfing these fries down I could taste every bit of authentic flavor to this dish. OMFG! Seriously the best of the best chili cheese fries I've ever had! I love how crispy these fries were and the oxtail flavor was just orgasmic. The raw jalapenos mixed in with the garlic aioli was heavenly. And the final cherry on top to this dish, that fried egg...omg, as I broke into that egg and it seeped down through all the fries, I seriously was jizzing all up in my panties right then and there!Now onto the burger! I ordered the Miyagi-san's Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which came with the most delicious beef patty, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. The bun itself had the right crunch and chewiness to it. I enjoyed every bit of this burger. Thanks Kristi (my waitress) for the recommendation!**The following night...around 11:30pm we returned to Bachi! Technically, I returned here and just brought the SBBF along.**Appetizers: 1) Truffle Parmesan Fries with parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream slathered all over it with a sun dried tomato aioli as the dip. The fries were delish! That black truffle cream hit the spot for these fries. There's really no need to even dip into the aioli because I felt it took away from that black truffle flavor on the fries.2) Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt and a yuzu citrus aioli for the dip. You can honestly never go wrong with sweet potato anything! These were bomb diggity, end of story.Burger:I went for the Kalbi Burger this time with angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made KIM CHEE and a ko chu jang mayo. I think because of the fact that I'm a kim chee whore, this burger totally topped the burger I had the night before. OMG! Flavor was just amazeballs! And the pickled cucumbers that came on a little side dish was heavenly! Mmmmmmmm baby!I also ordered their hot Japanese matcha green tea both times I came here.

First off, the oxtail chili cheese fries. Normally, I'm not a fan of chili, but I would eat a bowl of this stuff any day. It's not overloaded with cayenne or chili powder like some chilis, but is perfectly balanced. Smoky from the spices, rich from the oxtail and a creaminess from the fried egg on top. Put that on top of their crispy, fresh from the fryer French fries and you've got the best chili cheese fries I've ever had! Second, again, fries. This time, the Parmesan truffle fries. The sauce is a mushroom pur\u00e9e of sorts with truffle, and lots of shredded Parmesan. It comes with a sun dried tomato aioli, but I prefer the truffle sauce poured over the top. Delicious. And finally, the burger. This is the best burger in town. Now, I'm a simple person, not into anything complicated on my burger. I get the custom, the Angus with bacon and cheddar. Sounds pretty basic, right? Wrong. We'll start with the bun. They bake their buns in-house, a sweet, light, almost Hawaiian bun taste to them. They come out crispy and buttery, slowly absorbing the juices from the bacon and burger, and simply wonderful. Now, the bacon. Somehow, they've managed to make bacon even better. It's applewood smoked and caramelized, giving it that extra depth of flavor. A sweet and smoky taste in addition to the typical salty, porky flavor of bacon. Finally, we come to the burger. Juicy, tender, perfectly cooked a beautiful medium, perfect grill marks. It's a masterpiece of a beef patty. I can't give this place enough praise. Everything I've tried there has been delicious, but the three listed are easily my favorite. If I could, I'd eat there every week. Five stars. Ten out of ten.

\u00a0What was this yuzu citrus aioli about? \u00a0 I added some of it just on one bite, and \u00a0found that the burger really didn't need it at all. \u00a0In fact that was the opinion I had about every side of sauce served with each item. \u00a0yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN\u2026The second burger may have been even better! \u00a0More unique in flavor for sure. \u00a0The Banh-Mi Burger. \u00a0Ok, brace yourselves. \u00a0The patty is made up of...ground angus beef, pork, shrimp, pork pate, lemongrass, and plenty of other herbs and spices. \u00a0 It was topped with pickled carrots & radish, cilantro, curry aioli, and lettuce. \u00a0The nuoc mam dipping sauce (fish sauce with lime, garlic, vinegar, etc..) was served in a large bowl on the side. \u00a0Plenty of room to dip your burger in the bowl. \u00a0But once I did that, I felt the strong sauce covered up the wonderful flavor of the burger. \u00a0Again we had it medium rare and the juices were everywhere. \u00a0For those that complain that the burgers are too juicy and the bun can get soggy....Eat it faster!!! \u00a0I actually thought the bun held up well. \u00a0A burger that tastes this good, isn't going to last long on my plate. \u00a0yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN\u2026A burger isn't complete without some fries. \u00a0We had the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which were enough to share. \u00a0This isn't your usual truffle oil just poured on the fries, it's black truffle porcini cream. \u00a0WOW it was great, but not very much of it. \u00a0I wonder if you can get extra of it on your fries if you are willing to pay more. \u00a0The fries were perfectly cooked and sliced thin. \u00a0Topped with a small amount of slightly melted parmesan cheese. \u00a0Really after you got past the the top layer of fries, there wasn't much topping left, so share nicely everyone! \u00a0 We stayed away from the Sun Dried Tomato Aioli dipping sauce as the flavor overpowered a much superior flavor of the fries. \u00a0yelp.com/biz_photos/7sPN\u2026 Nothing left to say other than GO NOW!", "Date": "2012-04-18", "Author_Location": "Fullerton, CA"}, {"Author": "Natalia A.", "ReviewID": "lggn8iuIxQnmrUueuvI1xQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this place!

He said his two favorite burgers were the Shogun burger and the miyuagi san and that if its my first time I have to order the oxtail fries. I ordered the Shogun burger and oxtail fries and shared it with my husband. When my burger and fries came out the server came over and told me how to eat my shogun burger . He said you need to eat the peach first so it brings out the flavor for the burger. While eating my food the server had kept my drinks full and brought me a knife and extra napkins with a side plate to share with my husband. While eating my food I experienced the most unpleasant time when the guy standing in the window I believe he is the expediter or the manager because he was yelling at all his employees and was even using foul language in a restaurant where kids were.

My expectations were high from reading 4+ 5 star reviews. Upon arrival, we parked near subway. There's apparently two different entrances? I don't know if the way we entered was the back or the front (near bathroom)? There was no sign that said anything. When we walked in, we waited for a \"host/hostess\" to seat us. What we didn't expect was for this guy who was sitting with his family at a table to get up and greet us! Was caught off guard at first. Thought that guy was a customer?? [[ Food ]] Appetizers - the \"Chili fried chicken\" was thebomb .com! The taste of the fried chicken with the chili, ginger, and soy sauce gave it so much flavor and kick. And! the sweet potato fries was addicting. Entrees, we had to try there famous Bachi specialty burgers, not no steamed sandwiches. I picked \"KIKI's BURGER\" because I thought the name was funny hahaha :x \u00a0it had sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon, and gruyere cheese. The bff ordered the \"KALBI BURGER\" - ground beef, green onions, kim chee, with Ko Chu Jang Mayo. We both shared half of each other's burger so that we can say who ordered the better burger haha! Well... both tasted okay. It was good, but was it OMG that's frickin good!? NO. That is where the disappointment came in. The bff didn't expect the Kalbi burger to be what it was, which is like any other burger, but a different bun. We expected an actual Kalbi in there or something?! In my opinion, I thought the burgers tasted the exact same, only with different condiments. To wash it down, we drank a CHERRY YUZU SODA - made with pure sugar cane. Not like the cherry pepsi or coke. More on the sweeter side with less carbonation. FYI - not part of the free refills.[[ Restaurant ]]I'm a bit confused with the whole restaurant ambiance. Too many things going on. I think for business, it would be better if they added table booths for seating rather than just regular tables and chairs. OH! and can I say that I HATE there place mats!! Those darn things kept giving me small checkered imprints on my elbows. wth. Overall, customer service was fair. Food was average. Food presentation needs work.

\u00a0How could you go wrong? \u00a0They put jalapenos inside too, which definitely made it taste better. \u00a0It came with a tomato aioli, which was tasty. \u00a0But of course, something had to ruin it. \u00a0It was cold when we got it. \u00a0I don't know about you, but after waiting 40 minutes for food, cold fries aren't going to cut it.Overall, this place claims to have the best burgers in Las Vegas. \u00a0I'm sure there are plenty of other places you could go to to get better burgers. \u00a0This was very mediocre. \u00a0While everything sounds amazing, it really isn't. \u00a0The taste is alright, but not worth the price and definitely NOT worth the wait. \u00a0Plus, the service is absolutely horrible.UPDATE!There is an owner response to this review that I wrote. \u00a0However, the comment back is completely false. \u00a0I was pretty much being accused of not having tried the items that I wrote about because it wasn't on my receipt?

She returned numerous of times to check up on us and to make sure our drinks never dipped below half way. Even the manager(s) swung by to ask how everything was. All that was missing was for the chef to come out and greet us which I didn't expect would happen anyways. Bachi Burger seems like they're a mix combination of Japanese and Korean entwined with a fusion/gourmet twist. I saw both cultures' ingredients on the menu. To start we ordered the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries - with garlic aioli and a fried egg ($11.50). If you haven't figured it out by now, we Asians love to put a fried egg on everything: rice, noodles, burgers, and apparently now chili cheese fries. Forget house fries; order yourself one of these bad boys. You can easily share it between four people but if you're like the Craig R. who orders EIGHT items for two people, then this may not be sufficient. Check what he ordered in his review. The colossal mix was addicting and the skinny fries are a perfect blend. Then again, I'm biased against fat fries. When the server attempted to take the dish away to make room for our main entrees, I caught myself snarling at her because I wanted to eat the remaining four pieces. I was seriously stuck in between two places when it came to ordering my burger. Either Kiki's Burger ($9.5) - Angus beef, saut\u00e9ed shiitake, enoki & eryngi mushrooms, caramelized bacon, sweet onion marmalade, gruyere cheese, garlic chili aioli (doesn't it all sound heavenly) or the Kalbi Burger ($9) - Angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made kimchi, ko chu jang mayo. The Kalbi Burger won this time, only because Gooch who recommended this place to me told me to try it. Although I have full confidence in the Kiki's Burger, my Kalbi Burger was instant gratification. The mixed blend of Angus and kalbi sauce with the kimchi made me feel like I was eating at a Korean BBQ joint. To knock it out of the park for a grand slam, they should've or maybe I should've asked for them to throw a fried egg in it even though that might have be a little over kill. You can't go wrong with this burger. However, if I was to return I'd like to try Kiki's Burger to compare the two.I got to sample the Spicy Miso Burger and all I have to say about that is that it's not spicy at all. Also, my Kalbi Burger already had the knock out 1-2 punch so it would be unfair to say that this miso burger was mediocre. At that point, I was already mesmerized with my order.If you have a car or willing to travel a little out of the Strip, then venture off to Bachi Burger for an appetizing meal. They do close late on the weekends: 2 am, so you have plenty of time to plan your visit. The prices are reasonable, the food is sick (& great presentation), and the service is superb.Good looking out Gooch Y. for recommending this spot!", "Date": "2012-03-08", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Carlo C.", "ReviewID": "Vs7net1H0GGKgd9PxmlUcg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have to warn you that this review doesn't talk about their main staple because we don't eat meat. \u00a0We wanted to go to Miko's Sushi but didn't know they didn't serve lunch. \u00a0We had to think what restaurant is close enough and had some meatless options. \u00a0Since we have been hearing good things about Bachi Burger, we decided to see what the hype is about. \u00a0I have to say that they're vegetarian options are slim pickings for sure. \u00a0I ordered the Bachi Fish Burger, my partner got the That's Cheesy, and we shared the Garlic Salt and Pepper Fries. \u00a0I liked the Fish Burger but my partner wasn't a fan of the Grilled Cheese sandwich. \u00a0He didn't like the combo of the cheeses in it. \u00a0 We traded because I saw his face and he wasn't liking the dish. \u00a0I liked it enough. \u00a0I thought the fish was overcooked and that made it somewhat dry. \u00a0They were pretty stingy with the tartar sauce. \u00a0The fries we're pretty good. \u00a0I just wish they were a bit more crispy, or at least let the oil come off a little longer. \u00a0The biggest thing that was disappointing was the service. \u00a0With a very generous staff, I was surprised how slow the service was. \u00a0Granted, they were full to capacity with people waiting to be seated, the service left a lot to be desired. \u00a0Took them about 10 minutes after I have my card ready for payment to be picked up. \u00a0Good thing we weren't in a hurry.I have to say again, this isn't a reflection of their staple, the burgers. \u00a0They might be a good place for burgers but I have to say that the service needs to be more attentive. \u00a0If you like burgers, I'm sure you would like it more. \u00a0Also, they need to update their menu on the wall because they don't have some of their items available. \u00a0Also, they need to have spell check. \u00a0Instead of Chocolate Hazelnut Ice Cream Sandwich, they had \"Cocolate Hazlenut.\" \u00a0I just think they should have more vegetarian options. \u00a0Then again, it is a burger joint.", "Date": "2010-08-21", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Ingrid A.", "ReviewID": "ELRhKHJln7ZCc3zDgi7CwA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First time here. \u00a0I tried the Ronin burger with bacon and cheddar cheese...OMG absolutely delicious.

Even if you argue that I went to a location on an 'off day' I could really care less, if you are a professional and have opened a restaurant, there should be no such thing as an off day. I will however, go back to a place just for the pure enjoyment if it is good enough. Such is the case with Bachi Burger. I went many months ago, it's been one of the best burgers I've had in Vegas to date and I've had many people ask to go there with me. I've been twice in the last two weeks, and I'm not sure if I'm glad I went back.Since my first visit, they have finally added a few permanent, lit signs to the outside of the building so its presence is a little more noticeable. The d\u00e9cor hasn't changed at all, with simple loose tables and chairs, plain white walls, and some Asian-inspired photos for sale. I went once for dinner in the middle of the week, and the other day again for lunch. Both times I was able to sit right away unlike the first time, but that's about where the consistency stops. The night I went for dinner it was fairly busy, but our waitress helped us right away with drinks, and took our orders fairly promptly. I had pretty good company that night so I can't remember how long our wait was for the actual food, but between the appetizer and burgers I don't think it was too bad.My lunch visit was far worse. The friend I was with didn't quite know what she wanted to order right away, so after his first visit our waiter said he'd be back in a few minutes. I think we waited almost 20 minutes for him to return, and at least another 25 for our food to arrive once ordered. We sat down at 12:30pm in the middle of lunch, it was fairly busy but by the time we ordered the place had mostly cleared out so I didn't see why it would take that long. Her unpreparedness aside, our entire lunch took almost an hour and a half from sitting down to finishing our meal, far too long for folks that typically have an hour lunch break around town. I'm not sure if this is a common occurrence during the day, but considering that two out of three meals I've eaten here were sub-par in the service category, I might be noticing a trend here.The food itself is fantastic. Since having a Kiki burger on my first visit, I have since tried the Ronin burger and the Kalbi burger. Both burgers came out medium rare just as ordered, had all fresh, amazing toppings, and did not disappoint. The different combinations of kim chee, kalbi sauce, fried egg, and other Asian-inspired toppings are all succulent and the best examples of their flavor. I had the pickles during one meal which consisted of not your typical pickles, but pickled daikon, garlic, cauliflower and a few other items. It was delicious and different. Not too filling, but great flavor and a good prep for things to come. Both times I stuck to the parmesan and black truffle fries per request from my company at the table. The fries have great flavor, but during my most recent visit I had the chance to eat some of the fries with little seasoning on them near the bottom, and they weren't too great on their own. Still, all of the fries I have seen and tried here are loaded with seasoning and great in flavor.I'm not going to bother giving Bachi a new score, the burgers have been incredibly consistent and fantastic, but the service is just not what it should be from visit to visit. If you're not on a lunch break or in a rush, it is well worth the visit and still in my opinion one of the best burgers you can have in town. If impeccable service is your thing, then you need to loosen up a bit and get in here to see what you're missing out on. And if you are an employee of Bachi, please take note of my service comments. I'm sure you get slammed during lunch time and at dinner, but respect the hour-long lunch break and try to find ways to get your customers in and out of there with some efficiency.", "Date": "2011-10-01", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Stacy A.", "ReviewID": "v762zTGl8SKga5dgspljAA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I went to Bachi expecting excellence and left a little underwhelmed. \u00a0Maybe after reading the reviews my expectations were too high?? \u00a0I love the concept and I loved the atmosphere, but I just didn't love the meal. \u00a0For me, the Ronin was an average burger with a high price tag - \u00a0the meat was a tad overcooked, the egg was a little dry and really got lost on the bun. \u00a0The short rib steam buns were good....maybe a little more zing was needed to push it to awesome for me.

So when we finally went back to try it, we were less than impressed . First, the guy who seated us seemed less than happy about having to seat us. Some people came in behind us and asked if we were all together, my husband said \"no,there's 2\". It took the server way too long to figure out that the other people would be a table of 4. As he was seating us, he was yelling at the bus girl about why there was a 6 top set up, pretty rude, all in all. We got seated, then the people behind us got seated a couple minutes later, but somehow, the server went to greet those people first. Ok, but then it was another full 5-7 minutes before we were even approached. When Melissa finally came over, we were greeted by overly fake niceness. Never asked if we'd ever been there before, made any recommendations. She never asked if we wanted a drink to start, so we placed our order. We order the Bachi pickles, which are an APPETIZER, which usually means it comes FIRST. Nope, not at Bachi Burger, we got our fries and then our burgers and then asked if we still wanted the appetizer. \u00a0When we said no. Melissa asked if we were sure. The manager did come over and offered an explanation that there was a shift change going on and he offered his apology. Didn't actually say \"I'm sorry\" but said he wanted to offer his apology, which he never did. When we got our meals, Melissa was kind enough to bring extra napkins. And then more napkins even though we never used the first set of extra napkins she brought us, I took this as an implication that maybe we were slobs, interesting, since we hadn't spilled a drop. Oh well. Not a great experience. Bachi Burger was recommended to us by a friend and we saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and were looking forward to a burger experience. We didn't get anything more or special than we would have gotten at any other burger place. We've actually gotten better service and much less $$ burger joints.

There is always a stigma that burgers and fries are unhealthy. I won't try to refute it, but you can learn to overlook it for a great piece of Americana especially when you spice it up with an international twist. The interior of this place resembles that of an industrial art gallery. The mute walls are complimented with bright splashes of \u00a0Asian photography. The numerous lights above you do not flood the area with an obnoxious florescent feel, but emanates enough light to make it feel cozy. The earth tone place mates gives a warm contrast to the otherwise concrete room.Did you know that I was on a search for the perfect balls? Yes, they serve boba tea here and I am impressed. The tapioca were smaller than I am used to, but they have the right amount of chewiness, so they did not turn into spitballs. The taro milk tea was perfect; the richness of the taro, the creaminess of the milk, and the right amount of sweetness. My friend ordered the jasmine milk tea. I normally tend to avoid plain milk teas because the tea tend to go M.I.A. Not the case here. The jasmine is ever present and bold. Flowery and aromatic, I would order this again. If they had durian, I would be here more often. For $3.50, I can come here to get my boba fix and save the gas money. Who am I kidding? I would end up in Chinatown anyways.I walked in, expecting to get gouged, but found their prices reasonable. My dining partner and I split a Ronin burger and a Kiki burger. The meat used in these patties are moist and flavorful. The thick slabs of meat were definitely the star, but let the accoutrement boost it up. The Ronin burger is topped with an Asian slaw, fried egg, and pickled ginger. When I first bit into it, I was thrown off, and taken aback. The ginger can be off putting, but after the second bite it got better. By the time you had a few bites it is delicious. This burger is messy because the egg is over easy and the yolk will burst when you pick it up. The Kiki burger was perfection from the first taste. The mixed greens, bacon, and sauteed onions did not distract nor overpower the burger. The BBQ sauce did not mask any imperfections, but bound everything together.

Usually I think of In-n-Out or maybe Five Guys for a good burger, but now you can go and get a restaurant style burger for like $10-15. Bachi Burger is a joint like that where they throw the asian flair onto their burger in a fusion manner. I was a bit skeptical when I saw some of the items on the menu but when you try them out the flavor combinations turn out to be very good.First we started with the oxtail chili fries - now for me oxtail is one of the best things ever, and when you combine it into a chili and then top it on top of fries with a sunny side up egg, you got a winner. It is definitely enough to share as an appetizer - we did for 4 people - and everyone got a taste of the flavor explosion.Now there are way too many burgers to choose from, so our group of 4 decided to pick 4 different burgers so that we could all taste a little of each one. \u00a0We sampled the Ronin, Kalbi Burger, Spicy Miso Burger, and the Crab burger. We got all of the burgers medium rare (which is much better than the recommended medium) as the quality of the meat was actually very good. Overall, every burger had its own unique flavor combination and each of them I would have been happy with getting, but I was glad to share and try each one of them out. The Ronin had a japanese flavor to it, the kalbi as its name implies, had kimchi in the burger and actually went very well with the meat. The spicy miso was also very good and as I am a fan of shishito peppers chose this burger - it definitely was not \"spicy\" as the name implies and could have used something to give it more of a kick. The special burger of the night was the crab burger that added a crabcake on top of the burger which in itself was quite delicious.Overall, a very good \"high-end\" burger restaurant and I would like to go back and try some of their other flavors of burgers.", "Date": "2011-10-23", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Keven W.", "ReviewID": "G0YOLlgaKMtOKVTx4oMLKA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pretty good for a gourmet burger.

Each burger has a good amount of japanese zing that really differentiates itself from its all American counterparts. \u00a0One thing I would like to say is that usually when a restaurant decides to do a fusion/mashup theme there is a tendency to lose the first element in favor of the second. \u00a0For example it would be easy for a japanese fusion burger place to lose what makes a burger special so that they can cram in the japanese element. \u00a0A lot of times I've tried these fusion places only to find that they are only blending things together to be hip and cool not for flavor reasons. \u00a0I'm glad to say that when you bite into a Bachi Burger the japanese element is not overdone and you still get what makes a good burger a good burger. \u00a0I usually get the Ronin or the Kiki burger, as the first one has an egg (yes yes yes) and the second has my favorite ingredient (a ton of mushrooms). \u00a0Both burgers are great and are examples of fusion food done right. \u00a0All the elements of the Ronin blend together nicely and taste like a perfect balance of america and japanese cuisine, kind of like if the Fat Burger and Hamada's had a food baby. \u00a0The Kiki burger I feel was made for me \u00a0it has three kinds of japanese mushrooms Saut\u00e9ed Shiitake, Enoki, and Eryngii Mushrooms (what! yes please). \u00a0Enoki mushrooms are a really under utilized mushroom and they are great! \u00a0I've been waiting for somebody to put them on a burger for a long time. \u00a0In fact if you put anything with Enoki mushrooms in front of me I will plow through it like a mad animal. \u00a0Bottom line if you're looking for a fusion restaurant that is about taste and not about gimmicks this is a great place. \u00a0The only reason I'm going to give them a four star rating is because when they used to be the only japanese fusion burger on the block they were the the top. \u00a0Now, however, I think that they have lost their crown to Fuku Burger both in terms of price and taste. \u00a0This might seem harsh, but I don't think you can ignore the fact that Fuku Burger came out swinging, and took the title of best japanese fusion burger away from Bachi. \u00a0Does this mean that you should go to Bachi Burger for your burger needs....

I loved how the burgers had a nice charred crisp on the outside but still fairly juicy on the inside. The toppings all worked together very well, the mushrooms, Gruyere cheese, bacon. It was nice that they left the garlic chili aioli on the side for you to spread on your burger as you please. Also, we had the salt and pepper fries along with the sweet potato fries to share. The favorite was the salt and pepper that is mixed with some ginger, cilantro, and chili peppers. The sauce also complemented it very nicely. The sweet potato fries were cooked nicely but the sauce was not good. The Yuzu citrus aioli had a strange herb taste that we couldn't place. But the best part was probably the drinks. We had the strawberry jasmine lemonade and it was so tasty! It has a fresh strawberry puree with real strawberry bits. We also had the Momotaro, which was good but I can see it being too sweet to finish the entire glass. Oh and it comes in a really large glass so it's worth the $4.The bad: The two times my bf has come here, they have mixed his burger up with another person's in the party. He likes his burgers cooked medium-well but both times, they have been under cooked and we realized it was because the servers don't have an indicator for each burger's doneness. So while the servers remembered what each person ordered, they didn't know which burger was which.The ugly: After eating a few bites, my bf noticed it was way underdone. So he brought it to the waiter's attention. They took away his burger and when the waiter returned, it was literally the exact same burger he originally had, only cooked again. This means they put the patty that he had taken bites out of back on their grill rather than cooking a brand new one, like they should have. COMPLETELY unsanitary!

When I originally sat down to write this update, I thought my overall impression had not changed from my first review, but, as I was writing, things developed a little differently. Food: This time I had the \"That's Cheesy\" or whatever they call their grilled cheese. It sounded awesome on the menu, but in practice it was maybe so-so. There was a pretty good amount of cheese, and it was made well enough, but it just wasn't very tasty. Without a veggie burger on the menu, this is pretty much the only meat-less entree choice - so I definitely couldn't bring a vegetarian here. Gordon had the Kikis, and, after an initial wave of too-much-garlic, found it to be enjoyable. Service: The service was better than Yelp might lead you to think. Adorable Waitress was not serving many tables, which is probably a good choice for Bachi overall, but definitely not as far as I'm concerned. Consequently, we got Generic Asian Waitress. Her service was rendered adequately, but only adequately, and totally devoid of any charm. Say what you want about the flaws of my precious Adorable Waitress, but I'll take the more flawed service that comes with some personality over a technically-superior but totally bland serving automaton. Especially at a small, independent restaurant. Which brings me to: New conclusion: Bachi totally needs to up their game. Yes, the burgers and fries are pretty damn good. Yes the food is unique. But the decor is generic and effectively-identical to the numerous Asian restaurants we have in town, the service goes from simply horrible to presentable but lifeless, and the prices aren't exactly cheap. I already find myself bored with the menu after 2 visits, and there really isn't anything else about the place that makes it attractive. One reason I prefer independent establishments is that they FEEL LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT! \u00a0Something other than the faceless ownership and bland environs of Chain Food Hell. And when an indie place falters, aspects like cheap prices or awesome service can bolster them. But Bachi lacks nearly all of the positive traits of a small business. Personality? None. Bargains? Zero. Service? Conspicuously lame. So that leaves the food. And while it's admittedly good at Bachi, it's not *that* good.PRO-TIP: Another for the establishment. MANAGEMENT: Take a page from your competition and BE PERSONABLE! You're a brand new restaurant that only gets by with word of mouth AND you have a unique concept....so why isn't the owner or manager greeting customers when they walk in or sit down, introducing himself and the concept for the restaurant? Not only does it help to better sell the place, but it makes it easier to give you the benefit-of-the-doubt when something goes wrong.", "Date": "2010-06-07", "Author_Location": "Henderson, NV"}, {"Author": "Christine B.", "ReviewID": "MOBLXJlOm0bqqT1PmBo-lg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My favorite burger place in town, hands down. \u00a0I've had the Kiki and the Kalbi burger. \u00a0Both are amazing. \u00a0So flavorful and unique. \u00a0The bun is super soft and light. \u00a0The truffle parmesan fries are AMAZING. \u00a0I die for those fries. \u00a0I had a taro boba and that was pretty yummy, too. \u00a0Service isn't great (just kinda slow) and I wish I could take half a star off for that but the food is so good it makes up for it.", "Date": "2011-09-20", "Author_Location": "Honolulu, HI"}, {"Author": "Angel D.", "ReviewID": "FhCJzcR-Gt8OWxcIERUnxA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really good food, and great service!

Now I'm a complainer, I'll be the first to admit, but I'm also a complimenter (which is why most of my reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star). That being said, I cut Bachi Burger quite a bit of slack on my visit because I know they might not have the experience in the business yet to know how important something like, I don't know, having glasses that AREN'T chipped is (also I took a Xanax so that might have helped their case).Our server was pleasant, but like others, she disappeared after our order was taken. We all ordered a specialty drink and when I got mine I noticed the bottom was extremely chipped. I flagged down a second waitress (Jordan) and asked for a glass that wasn't chipped (you know, so I don't ACCIDENTALLY DRINK GLASS AND DIE) and she went to the counter, pulled one glass out, saw it was also chipped and came back with it to my table. \"Well, all the glasses are chipped,\" she said, \"Is yours sitting on the table weird or something?\" Nope, it sat on the table just fine, I just didn't want to have to sue her place of employment when I cut the crap out of myself. \u00a0Whatever, I let it go and drank out of the chipped glass as I watched her walk to a table in the corner, sit and take her break for ten minutes. I drank out of the chipped glass as I watched a very tall gentleman, whose only job I observed in the 90 minutes we were there seemed to be macking on the waitresses, come over and chat her up. Fine, everyone is allowed a break, just maybe, you know, NOT in the dining room where everyone can see you including the 10 people waiting in the lobby to be seated. The rest of our meal went pretty much like many of the other reviews listed: food brought out in a seemingly arbitrary order, drinks going unfilled for 10 minutes or longer (at one point I actually went to the counter, took the pitcher and filled my drink myself), burgers that were requested medium rare coming out medium, etc. I had to go up to the counter again to order flag someone down to take my desert order and Jordan, the \"Is it sitting on the table weird\", came over to take it. Then ten minutes later our actual server came over again to take our desert order. It was just very chaotic and frustrating.  Obviously the management at Bachi Burger KNOWS of these issues. They clearly read the yelp page and I'm clearly not the first person to complain, but they've done NOTHING to fix it. Maybe they just don't know how or just don't care because enough of us come back anyway, even with the poor service. \u00a0I would really like to see this restaurant shaped up Gorden Ramsey style. Whoever the tall gentleman I mentioned previously was I didn't see him do anything the entire evening.

First, our server was inattentive. She didn't give us an attitude but she seemed like her mind was elsewhere. We were just a party of five, but ran out of tea and water regularly. We each ordered fries, but some came as appetizers and some during the meal with no explanation. The extra sauces we ordered with the meal weren't brought to us. We had to ask for them again. To top it off they screwed up the meal ticket. As our party was seated we had asked our server if she could create two tickets. She said, \"yea, no problem.\" At the end of our meal she brought us one ticket, not two. We tried to talk to her, but after five minutes of waiting we couldn't find her. At this point we were fed up with the service and just wanted to leave. Three party members pooled cash for their meals and tip. Our server still nowhere in sight, I walked the check up to the manager and explained that he should put $33 on the card, the rest of our ticket was paid in cash. He delegated it to a man who clearly didn't understand how to operate their payment system. My card was promptly charged the entire $97. A simple apology was offered, no more. I signed the receipt, got the cash back, and left. The next day I had to rush to the bank and deposit the cash so that my insurance bill would clear.Sure the burgers and fries were great, but the service us five received was terrible.

Not only are the burgers really good, but the toppings and flavors are all really interesting and exotic. They have standard cheeseburgers as well, for those who don't want to branch out, but for anyone interested, they have burgers with all kinds of different Asian toppings (slaw, kimchee chi, different cheeses and bacons, lots of mushrooms, sauces, etc). Even for specialty burgers, the price is pretty good, unless you get up into the really fancy stuff (wagyu, crab, foie gras, etc). My husband and I went and got one 'normal' specialty burger (I can't remember the name - Ronin maybe? It's the first one on the menu) and one of the more extreme (blue & green or something like that), an order of truffle fries, and one beer. Both burgers were REALLY GOOD, but I preferred the Ronin. The bacon on the other one was just a little too overpowering for me. Truffle fries were excellent as well. The whole thing cost $40 with tip and we had plenty of leftovers (not that you could save them long - the burgers are so loaded with sauces & wet toppings that they're soggy in an hour). There was a decent-sized crowd in there on a Friday night, service was very prompt and friendly, and I love that it's near my neighborhood. MOST IMPORTANTLY - Bachi Burger is unlike anything else in the area! I love a great, new, unique, independent restaurant that's NOT on the strip!

The burger was delicious with amazing flavor of mint and lemongrass. It came with a great dipping sauce that smelled like fish sauce. Other people in my group got the crusty crab, lonely bird, grilled fish sandwiches and they all enjoyed it. Our sides of sweet potatoe, truffle parmesean, and plain fries was a great complement to our sandwiches. It came in this pseudo-cool funnel container that's supposed to mask how little you get. Nonetheless, the fries were good but a bit thin. For dessert we got the Portuguese Donuts with coffee gelato, and their berry poptart. It tasted fresh and not overtly sweet. What prevented this place from getting a higher rating was the service and weird entrances. There are two entrances. One with a couch and tv with a lounge vibe. The second was cramped and messy with chairs and newspapers. We were at the latter. I think this is totally detrimental to the quality of service. At the time, there was one guy working the front and he had to juggle both sides. He looked flustered while holding his clipboard. The wait time for food was unnecessarily long.

BACHI BURGER works pretty darn hard at getting good product. they seem very conscientious about (locally) sourcing premium ingredients -- i mean LAS VEGAS is in the middle of the desert. i believe their recipes are stellar but their execution (at least the night we were there) is mediocre at best. other reviewers have complained about the service. ours was fairly attentive -- she did disappear toward the end of dinner and we had a bit of a time getting our check -- surprising because we came early (on a friday night) and by the time we were ready to leave the place was really filling up. but my biggest complaint was that she seemed bewildered by the menu and couldn't answer any of our questions and we had a few. the menu was confusing -- for example the THAT's CHEESY burger under the specialty burger heading and just above the notation that all their burgers are 100% angus beef is a cheeseburger sans burger -- who knew ??? kid's GRILLED CHEESE was nasty -- no ifs, ands or buts.

I'm happy to say that they took our reviews into account and service is great. Now for the review. I wanted a great burger, something different in town besides the usual burger joints. After reading about this place, despite service issues, I needed to try it for myself. \u00a0My husband and I headed down and we were seated as we approached the front counter. They need a \"please wait to be seated\" sign because the layout makes one assume that it's a place where you order at the counter. Anyway, we were seated by this adorable waitress and our drink orders were taken immediately. The menu is simple and unique from any other burger place here. We decided on chili fried chicken appetizer, 2 kiki burgers, one truffle fries and one garlic, and 1 honeydew boba shake. The appetizer was good but luke warm making me assume it sat at the window for a moment. The flavors were really good but the plate wasn't what I expected. It's small boneless nuggets, not wings like I assumed. Still tasted great. The fries and burgers didn't take more than ten minutes and were nicely plated. All the aoilis were great. I was hoping that the aoli was made to order but I think it was made in a large batch. Still it was good and the one served with the truffle fries was so good that we ordered another side of it. As everyone says, all seasoned dries need more seasoning because it's not penetrating the fries but sitting as a sprinkle on top after being put in the cones. \u00a0 as for the burger, the flavors are right on but here's the kicker-the texture needs work. Here's what I mean. When you have the caramelized onions, soft greens, soft mushrooms and bacon and then the burger has a pate-like texture, it's slightly off putting. (see my cut open pic). I can see where some feel that the burger is too mushy, because it's texture is super soft rather than having that firmness that burgers have. Despite this, I enjoyed the flavor profile. Nicely done. For those who enjoy the meat flavor in their burgers, places like this aren't for you. This place is about turning other foods into burger form. I would eat here again but I hope they try to add more textures into their burger. Try a cheese twill instead of sliced cheese to give it a change from the mush and softness of the burger and toppings. Other than that I liked it. The honeydew boba was nice, too. You should give it a try for something unique. This place is about the experience, and you'll get a good one.", "Date": "2010-06-06", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Scott B.", "ReviewID": "9C5UolEKaKMykEnWgDCk3g", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Didn't make it to the food. \u00a0I've been in vegas for 14 years and this is without question the worst service I've experienced. \u00a0I (and 4 others with me) work in the area, eat well, tip well, and don't worry about the cost. \u00a0Won't go back there again. \u00a0If there's any kind of wait, I'd suggest you find another option.", "Date": "2013-06-21", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Kelley N.", "ReviewID": "HBaNyWwGPN_z3j2byfKrrw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Finally found a restaurant that I like after recently moving here from San Francisco.

After some driving, she suggested a place she actually used to work at that had boba and other snacks and before I knew it, we were pulling into Bachi Burger's parking lot.My first impression of this place was obviously the interior. The place looked modern and so comfy. What made my experience here so dope was not only the food but the friendliness of each of the staff members. The manager made our visit very pleasant, as he joked around with my friend and I. The service was definitely top-notch and a lot better than even high end restaurants I've dined at in the past. It was easy to see that the servers were genuinely nice and enjoyed engaging in conversations with you. I even noticed how personable our server was as he made an effort to stop at every table every so often. I feel bad for forgetting his name so hopefully he sees this and pats himself on the back 'coz he is awesome.Now.. onto the food. It took me a while to decide what I wanted since I wasn't hungry enough for a burger but had the appetite for something larger than just a dessert, which was what I wanted originally, haha. After scanning Yelp for a few suggestions, I went with the truffle parmesean fries and the mandarin orange tangerine soda (which I learned they make themselves). As cliche as this sounds.. it was definitely LOVE AT FIRST BITE. The truffle oil on the fries was the perfect touch with fries that weren't too crispy or too soft. The sun-dried tomato sauce paired with the fries was the cherry atop the sundae. The mandarin orange tangerine soda was simply amazing for something that sounds so simple. My friend told me this place is owned by two brothers, one being a former executive chef for Roy's Hawaiian Fusion. No wonder this place is so damn good! \u00a0As we sat and enjoyed our better than dessert midnight snack, I watched as the table next to us received their burger orders. The burgers looked mouthwatering. I was this close to ordering one but I'll save that for my next trip.This place is perfect for late night cravings, as they are open until 2AM. We left at around 130 and there was even still another table present but the dope staff didn't even rush them to leave. I definitely will be returning soon and by then, I'm sure Bachi Burger will be a household name.

It's first-rate ingredients prepared with great care, most with an Asian influence.I got the pickle plate appetizer, the mushroom cheeseburger, the salt-and-pepper fries and a soda they make in-house with cherry and some sort of Japanese fruit.As soon as the pickle plate comes you know the owner is a friend of foodies. There's little bites of six separate things, all quite interesting. My two favorites were the daikon radish and the garlic.The pepper in the salt-and0pepper fries are jalapenos. They're not too spicy. When the fries arrived they reminded me of a pepper-infused crab dish at Yummy Yummy in San Francisco. Interesting smells. And they tasted great. I got the pineapple ketchup o go with the fries but it didn't do much for me. The garlic aoili sauce was pretty good.The burger was great. The black angus beef was first rate and perfectly seasoned and cooked. I loved all the different mushrooms they put on the burger. The gruyere cheese was tasty. And the bun was good, too.Maybe the only disappointment was the soda. I was hoping for something with some zingy acidity to match the rich foods, but it was a little flat.

They also offer so many choices of burgers that are so interesting! -If you really want to splurge, try the Shogun burger. It's the best burger I've ever had, hands down.-Miyagi-san is definitely the best burger if you don't want to take risks. It's not bad, it's a GREAT burger! But if you're not feeling some of that fusion stuff.-The Ronin Burger was awesome. It had so many layers of taste; my friends and I decided that it tastes somewhat like a sushi roll. Sounds weird, but it's really goooood.-Kiki burger is a really good mushroom burger!-Their oxtail chili cheese fries were HUGE. And delicious! However, like everyone else, I do wish for a bit more oxtail in it. But nonetheless, bomb.-Their truffle fries are amazing too! Definitely my favorite truffle fries I've had yet. Not dry at all! Crispy and moist.-Mr. Ho burger. If you like sweet taro bun and pork sausage, try it. It's a bit on the Chinese bun side, it was very interesting, but I couldn't finish it because it was a bit sweet for a burger.Never had Umami Burger, but my friends at the table are quite the foodies and had quite of a bit of Umami Burger...

Maybe a 3.5?Their idea is cool and they got some neat combinations but execution is lacking some areas. The wait wasn't really an issue as we had a large party (8) and they just needed to setup a bit. While waiting, i scoped out the menu a bit to see what they offered.The baos looked interesting, but it would have been too much. The party shared the ox tail chili cheese fries and they were pretty tasty. I would like there to be more ox tail, but it was good.I got the Miyagi-san burger, medium rare, which was grass-fed wagyu, fried egg, bacon, furikake and onion strings. The sauce was a chili mayo. Also got a side of the sea salt fries.Presentation - awesome. The burger looked great and toppings stacked nicely. Good char on the beef. Taste: Was just okay. Good flavors from the ingredients, but I think the flavor of the meat was kind of lacking. Maybe it was too sweet or something, but I was expecting a more savory taste from the beef. Beef was a letdown and a bit on the flavorless side. I might stick with Angus next time as I had a taste of another burger and it seemed to be more flavorful.I think what kind of made everything a let down was the service. When going to like a pho restaurant, I expect there to be no service. But when you're serving gourmet burgers with foie gras I would hope there would be something better than what I see at a pho joint. The servers just seemed a tad surly. No smiles and seems to have a bit of an attitude. Kinda just going through the motions and they ask you for help. Not even in a nice way. Was just \"can you pass this down?\" no please? no thanks?I can understand if it was a booth and the server can't get to some people. She was just lazy and started giving us appetizer plates and asked us to send them down. Same with the water. Plopped them down at one end of the table and again asked us to pass them down. I was surprised I wasn't asked to pass the food down as well. So they're able to give the food to everyone individually, but water and plates are too much trouble. Towards the end of our meal, some people are still eating, they start clearing the table right as people finish their plates. You get that rushed feeling like they want to kick you out. The fries we shared were still half full and she started to take them away. She only asked if we wanted to continue to eat them after we kinda looked at her taking the fries away. Why so quick to get everything away? It wasn't like there was a line waiting. We were eating lunch at like 2PM. No wait and restaurant was half empty. Oh, and in true fashion, she also asked us to pass the plates up and over to her so she wouldn't have to walk around to each setting and pick up the plates.Like I said, I'm a bit torn.

You would think because of this that the food might have come out quicker but this was far from the case as it took almost 40 minutes to get our food from order to food on the table. Not to mention the fact that the waitress was way off her game, she managed to mix up everybody's drink at the table, not know what burger went to who when they FINALLY came out and after being asked 3 separate times for \"NO ONIONS\" on one of the burgers at our table it still came out with onions on it. The service here is far sub par for a restaurant with such high ratings from the public. Sure the food is good but i personally will not come back as the wait was truly ridiculous, the service was incredibly lacking, and the fact that i was STILL HUNGRY after my meal is just not acceptable to me. I don't remember ever leaving Burger Bar hungry so ill probably just continue going there till i find something else. Its just OK people for a trip to a restaurant... if you must try it be prepared for the bad service and the LONG wait for your food as countless others have already expressed on this site.", "Date": "2010-05-27", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Robert C.", "ReviewID": "tyn3yMFcq8QPdrYYPulUjw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a unique take on burgers!!

If you are a little more open minded and crave the satisfying structure of a burger with a new and unique spin, come on down to Bachi burger.The wait wasn't too long for the two of us. My girlfriend ordered the Kiki burger and I the Kalbi burger. We shared some parmesean truffle fries which were ultra tasty and came with a sun dried tomato aioli sauce that was perhaps one of the finest sauces I have ever tasted. They were cut thin like average fries but far from average in taste and quality. The burgers themselves arrived 15-20 minutes after ordering and were cooked medium rare as requested. The kiki burger featured sweet caramelized onions and three different kinds of asian mushrooms. My Kalbi burger came with a sweet korean bbq marinade, green onions and enough kimchi to give it a noticeable kick. It was blissful. The meat was juicy and plentiful, the marinade was not excessive or overpowering (although it did drip all over my hands and face) and the balance of the sweet with the spicy kimchi simply turned out to be a winning combination. I'm a man with a respectable appetite and upon finishing the burger and fries was thoroughly stuffed. I had the green tea to drink on the side.We didn't try deserts or appetizers but we'll definitely be making a trip back here to see what other goodies this place has to offer. The bottom line is that Bachi burger offers a unique, Asian spin on the classic American burger with delicious results.

I just had it 2 days from this post and I wanted it again and tried to hit it up before I left the sweet town of LV, but damned it all they are closed on Sundays, DRAT . Let's take this as a walkthrough, I'd like to be how very detailed in the whole experience. 1. Walk - in, little worried b/c even with good reviews I've seen from yelp that it wasn't that busy, also the few customers we did see didn't order burgers but sandwiches. 2. The Sit Down. It was a nice looking decor, just arriving to LV and was starving anything seemed good, but I didn't know what I was about to get into. We order some waters, get them fast because it wasn't that busy considering it was around 3 PM, We order the fries, sweet potato, the truffle oil, and garlic fries. They come out first. 3. The fries. The Garlic fries were the first I tasted, each basket of fries come out in nice decor and although it's 4 $ each approximately for a little more than a handful you'd expect to get more, but it's really the perfect amount you need. Again well the garlic fries were great, they had good taste, and had a little kick of spice I would think from jalapeno. It was really awesome! Second I tried the Sweet Potato fries, which were cooked to the greatest form...the texture and crispness to the fries was really good. Then I tried the truffle oil fries, by themselves I thought were alright, but when you add them with the sauce / chutney that is arranged with each basket, it definitely does not disappoint.4. The Burger, Oh goodness....the burger...it was just amazing...I ordered the Kalbi burger, and was actually reluctant b/c the waitress didn't really acknowledge it as a good choice...or even ask how I liked my burger cooked (I ususally get medium-rare, or medium), but it didn't matter...it just didn't...it was just that good. My burger had a perfect bun, wasn't soggy or anything, it held true form as I devoured my burger from first bite to last. The patty! Man if you've had Korean BBQ / Kalbi, then you know that's already money, but on this marinade on the patty! SOOOO GOOD!!!! It also had a thin layer of Kim-Chee and served with a side of pickled cucumber (ouee kimchi, is what I think it's spelled), I wish I could describe it better, there was more to the burger...but I just totally just hypnotized by it's taste. 5. Service, I know it wasn't crowded but service was amazing, it seemed everytime I sipped water, someone would fill it to full right after I put it down. The staff was nice, give you a warm greeting and a happy good bye b/c I think they're glad to see satisfied customers, and I was most definitely one of them.

\u00a0Nice! \u00a0Too much of this Red Matter would definitely melt the planet Vulcan. \u00a0Although the creaminess of the aioli was soft and relaxing as silk, the Chili taste soon followed to wake your taste buds and start the party. \u00a0Add a few drops of that Garlic Chili water \u00a0. . . \u00a0now that's a tasty fry. \u00a0In retrospect, I happily noted that there was no ketchup, nor did we need it. \u00a0I would venture to guess that a ketchup request would not only be bad form but also admitting to a poor palate, so don't embarrass yourself. \u00a0Perusing the menu, it was obvious why these burgers are so tasty; Wagyu and Angus beef are the chief ingredients. \u00a0Although grinding up a perfect Wagyu steak to make a burger struck me as a foodie faux pas, the end result was a mouthful of amazing. \u00a0My favorite was the Miyagi San Burger. \u00a0Despite it being grass fed, this bovine creation was tender and juicy. \u00a0Caramelized bacon and a fried egg provided a palate party platform that held everything together, then a juicy first bite impression of a burger unlike any other that. \u00a0A similar taste was found in the Kiki's Burger, as it also had caramelized bacon. \u00a0But in this case a thin layer of sweet onion marmalade gave an almost dessert like finish. \u00a0A few dips in the provided aioli sauce were the perfect lubricant to pair with this patty. \u00a0Combining the thoughts behind those two burgers, I believe they came up with the Ronin burger. \u00a0Again the associated unique sauces with the unique ingredients were perfectly paired, in this case Japanese Cole Slaw and Miso Goma with a Yuzu Ailoi. \u00a0Very clever, very clever indeed! \u00a0Going towards the surf/turf part of the menu, shrimp was introduced into The Bahn-Mi Burger among other spices that offered the full flavor of curry and chili spice, again without the bite that one would anticipate after tasting such a powerful piece. \u00a0The creativity award goes to the Crusty Crab, pan roasted crab cake with Mango Chutney. \u00a0The preparation of the crab cake in itself was impressive. \u00a0The propensity to overcook and over bread the crab cake is so clich\u00e9. \u00a0In this case, minimal breading yet still firm, this crustacean cake was a divine pairing with the mango chutney. \u00a0Bravo!I extend my compliments to Chef Dave and Chef Lauren with their creativity behind the meaty masterpieces that we devoured. \u00a0It would be unfair to juxtapose this establishment against my normal Naomi Wise trained star grading parameters, as those parameters were designed for fine dining establishments. \u00a0Suffice it to say, however, in the casual dining arena I have to write 4.5 stars all the way. \u00a0Date Night Factor: \u00a0Messy food advisory! \u00a0Great for a casual date, don't plan on impressing your date with the culinary mess that will result. \u00a0 \u00a0Bang for the Buck Barometer: \u00a0Pricey for a burger joint, but well worth it. \u00a0Two orders of fries, four beers, five burgers and coke set us back $110 with tip.

These aren't your typical teriyaki cheeseburgers passing off as Asian fast food. First, the salt & pepper fries were first rate: thin, crispy, a little spicy (topped with some jalepenos). The fried chicken \"kara-age\" appetizer was also very good. They know how to fry food and season it to go with your beer. The pork belly steamed buns, sort of like sliders with bao-style buns and excellent hoisin dipping sauce, were very tasty. My 7-year-old son gobbled them up. I was skeptical about the Banh-mi Burger, but it blew me away. They go to great lengths to capture the essence of the classic Vietnamese sandwich, right down to the pate, herbs, and fantastic nam plah dipping sauce. Dip, bite, chew, smile. Repeat.I also tried the Lonely Bird, a blended poultry burger (turkey/chicken) that somehow captures the flavors of \"tsukune\", the chicken meatballs doused in sweet sauce that you order at Japanese yakitori houses.

Guys, train your staff properly or your business will go down as quickly as you went up. If I was a secret shopper your business would have been in deep trouble.

Going to a restaurant begins with the experience of the ambiance, service, and food quality. You walk in the front door and there's a tiny hostess stand with a \"waiting\" area of about 4ft by 8ft. They're very busy so after putting our name down & qoated an hour we were told to wait on the patio, or if we wanted a drink to go to the counter/bar, which was 2 ft from the hostess stand. It was a claustrophobics nightmare. The layout needs to be adjusted badly. Having one guy serve drinks to everyone, & I mean EVERYONE, servers, guests waiting, takeout orders, is crazy!! We waited 20 min in this long line stretching around peoples tables, which was awkward for them and us. Who wants to be surrounded by extrememly hungry guests while you're trying to eat at your table?!

She turns to us and says, \"If you want to go to our other location, we can be seated faster.\" HAHA, that's in Summerlin, and we've already waited 30 minutes. That's the most rediculous thing i've heard. We sat on the patio which was 100 degrees outside and wasn't even like an actual patio, more like my un-occupied neighbors backyard patio with metal chairs and uneven tables. The restaurant wasn't much better then outside. For a well known restaurant, you'd think they could afford better a/c. They had floor fans in corners of the restaurant, which just blew hot air since it was soo hot in there already. I have never gone through such agony to try a burger in my life.

I'll take it! the pesto sauce on it was quite lovely and i won't deny that i wiped that little saucer clean of it. i tried a bite of Dan's cheeseburger with bacon and was quite pleased but i will stick with my lonely bird personally. we all shared sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries. my choice was to order the truffle parmesan and i wasn't TOO impressed with them for the mere fact that about only 6 or 7 fries actually had the truffle sauce on them. all the others were pretty basic but still good to dip in the sun dried tomato sauce. I'd go for the sweet potato fries over those. the sweet potato's were crispy and packed with sweet potato flavor. i didn't feel the need to dip those in any of the fancy sauces.needless to say, after all that yummy food we were all too stuffed to order dessert. I will be back though to try some of those little donuts with some ice cream and maybe sneak in a coffee.

And unfortunately, it's because of the service. I asked if the Banh Mi sandwich was a choice between beef, pork, shrimp and our server said yes. I said, I'll take the \"shrimp banh mi burger\" and then followed by \"no pork pate on that\". It arrived and it was ground meat and I thought, \"okay that's weird. Is that ground shrimp?\". I took a few bites and realized it tasted like a mixture that included pork. So I grabbed the server and asked her and she said that it was all mixed together. At the time I ordered my food, shouldn't she have corrected me when I asked for that \"shrimp\" banh mi sandwich? I tried to get something else but the server said, \"well, we'll have to charge you for the new item\". Excuse me? I grew up in the restaurant and hospitality industry and that is NEVER the answer. It wasn't the cost but the fact that she didn't seem to care. A few minutes later she came by and said, \"oh, we are offering a complimentary dessert to moms for mother's day.

I am appalled that they allowed me to walk out their restaurant knowing that I was very unhappy and still hungry. \u00a0Really bad move on their part and perhaps a restaurant manager should have stepped in.

Well, originally I would have only taken off a single star for being too cheap to serve Coke, and instead having Pepsi.

I've never understood why owners would consider saving a couple of bucks a month more important than giving customers what they want. As for the food itself, it was very good. I also found the pineapple ketchup to be unique and very tasty. The real problem was that the place was full of flies! It was pretty difficult to enjoy my food while defending it, and myself from the flies. It was pretty disconcerting when one actually flew into my ear! I noticed that I wasn't the only customer spending his time trying to swat the flies away. When the waiter came by to ask me if I needed anything, I told him that I could use a fly swatter. Apparently, judging by the smirk, he either didn't get the not so subtle hint, or couldn't be bothered with trying to fix the problem. Upon leaving, I noticed that they were doing work outside on the chairs. Most likely they couldn't be bothered with closing the back door. Of course, this was only a mild discomfort, compared to the stomachache and three hurried trips to the bathroom a few hours later.

If you're in a wheelchair you'd have to enter by the subway and go around to the entrance facing Windmill. There's a waiting area with a leather couch and a table near the bathrooms so that was where I waited after placing my order. The server was very polite and quick to assist me, including a cup of hot green tea while I waited. The tea seemed like matcha or a powdered green tea and was pleasant. The food seems a bit expensive but it is indeed tasty- \u00a0would be more reasonable at 3/4ths the price. The mango milkshake was very tasty and made my boyfriend happy. I had the jasmine green tea boba and it was just alright. The boba were smaller than at volcano tea and some were a little too soft. An order of the peking duck dumplings has 3 decent sized little buns filled with several slices of duck, radish, herbs and garnish. They're really tasty, with the soft bun complimenting the savory meat. We ordered the Kiki and Banh mi \u00a0burgers as well. Both were tasty, with interesting combinations of textures and flavors to deviate from the standard lettuce, tomato and onion combos. Soy flavors had a strong presence in both, as well as a sweetness from either mirin or sugar. My kiki was a well executed medium rare. Unfortunately by the time I got home some of the fries had gotten soft. I personally like them on the softer side, so I didn't mind too much but something crispy lovers might want to consider before doing take-out. \u00a0I'd like to go again \u00a0to try the other things they have on the menu, perhaps focusing more on appetizers and sides. The japanese pickles and the sausages both sound promising. It's a little out of the way and a little overpriced for me to be a frequent customer, but it's a pleasant change of pace from the routine and an enjoyable restaurant. The interior isn't the most lavishly seated, but I really like the chalk board menu and use of warm-toned, richly glossed woods and marble throughout. The aioli for the fries is very tasty! An outdoor area would also be a nice addition as they have a covered area, but I don't know if their lease or the infernal Vegas heat would permit it.

Ok, of course I was wondering just what that means...they don't accept takeout orders on sundays because of the sabbath or something? Makes zero sense but whatever. So the next day I decide to give them a second shot. I call again and ask to place a takeout order. The hostess or whoever answers the phone, says she is not sure if they are not taking takeout orders and i ask WHY NOT. She says some BS about it depends on how busy they are and she will check.

I took a bite of the Ronin and it was just great! I wil have it again. The Kalbi burger was good too, but the Kim Chee essense kind of threw the taste off a bit (and I am Korean too). The hamburger meat is a 10 on the quality scale, this ain't no $1 McDs burger, no no no. Their bun should be the standard for all hamburger buns, it is just a light carrier for the meat and doesn't overpower the other flavors, but not to say it is just a piece of bread either. The sweet potato fries were excellent and so was the regular fries, BUT once again I have a pet peave over those thin shoestring fries, I just never liked them. When I want a french fry, give me a huge steak frie, not those little shoelace fries. The dipping sauces were cute and tasty. Pineapple ketchup was ok, but not my favorite, the wasabi mayo tasting one for the sweet potato fries is much better. All in all a great place and very comfortable and casual. I did my homework and expected a long wait for my burger to come out, but it didn't take but 10 minutes or so.

The buns on these burgers are soft and really good. \u00a0Also, I have tried the steamed sandwiches, such as the duck and pork belly sandwiches. \u00a0These are great.Their sausage appetizers are pretty good. \u00a0We order this for our little one all the time. \u00a0Their fries are awesome too, especially the truffle fries. \u00a0 This place definitely has a good vibe and the waiters/waitresses are friendly. \u00a0It does get busy at times, so you may want to get their by 1130 for lunch or arrive on earlier dinner times (6??). \u00a0Whenever I have guests from out of town and are in the mood for burgers, I definitely recommend this place. \u00a0I do give them a heads up it takes a little while for the burgers to cook, so their expectations for a little wait are set. \u00a0The good thing is that they have TVs that you can watch while you wait, if you're not chatting with your friends. \u00a0It's always tuned to the cooking or food channel, so there's a chance you will get hungrier, while you wait. \u00a0It makes the food even better when it arrives and you take your first bites. \u00a0So far, I think everyone leaves satisfied and happy like I am.", "Date": "2011-10-19", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Scott C.", "ReviewID": "bzwrS4gTog5um2uY4_qMnw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food with a spin focused on asian influences. \u00a0I would definitely return.", "Date": "2012-01-21", "Author_Location": "Sparks, NV"}, {"Author": "Joe L.", "ReviewID": "x8xcy-opDQOOo5Wq2Ushbg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Consistently interesting, and the milkshakes are great.

I had the Banh Mi Burger , and my wife had the Kiki's Burger..we wanted to get the Oxtail chili Fries but the order is HUGE so the waitress suggested we order the regular fries with a side order of the Oxtail Chili (only $2 and perfect) ..Being a big fan of Banh Mi the Banh mi Bachi burger was outstanding!!!...Beef , pork and shrimp made into a burger patty , pork pate , curry aioli , nuoc mam sauce and the pickled carrots , onions and Jalapeno slices...this burger had everything. All the different flavors yet not too complicated...DELICIOUS!!the bun was probably the best burger bun I have ever had. I have been bragging about this burger for the past 6 days...The Kiki's Burger was also amazing , with eryongi , enoki and shittake mushrooms , bacon , sweet onion marmalade gruyere cheese and garlic chili aioli !! WOW!!! My wife would have been thrilled to have gone back there for dinner the same night. The oxtail chili was spicy , sweet and layered with gooey cheese (which is always a good thing) we dipped our fries in it and it didnt take long for us to polish that off. Great Asian flavors all around with a comforting atmosphere , excellent service and good prices.
