And the staff that cleans up was courteous. Tons of indoor space. And somehow I made it on a day where there was only, maybe 15 people in line. But, it's hard for me, as a local, to justify being corralled into a line like herded cattle, and scolded when I stand in this line by staff carrying pans of food. There is a polite way to say things loudly even if you're carrying hot food. That might be a schtick, but it's off-putting when so many restaurants in the Quarter work on being congenial to both tourists and locals. $40 bucks for two Bloody Mary's and 2 2/3 dressed roast beef poboys is redonkulous. Their roast beef poboys are good, and 2/3rds is the perfect amount for me, but for the amount we paid, I'm usually leaving with half my overstuffed poboy, a pleasant service experience, and some change.For some people, this is a cool experience, and that's great.

My pancake was so COLD the butter wouldn't melt, but because they were rude, I was hesitant to make a complaint. I know my pancake was not the only cold one because a lady nearby sent hers back to the kitchen and I heard the cook complaining. The syrup was really hot, which is the only thing that made the pancake hot and edible. Also, the \u00a0biscuit was not very good either. I asked my companion if he thought the biscuit was made from cornmeal instead of flour because it was a bit dense and gritty.

Preferable for me over muffulettas (another type of New Orleans sandwich). Ferdi special po'boy- A must try since it's their iconic sandwich. I love Debris. It's that beefy dripping looking stuff drizzled on your po'poy.Roast beef po'boy- If you like roast beef and meat, you'll like this. Roast beef and debris. Yum.

After 24 years of living here, I finally decided to give it a shot. I want to preface this review by saying I rarely like to leave bad reviews on restaurants I've only eaten at one time. \u00a0Every restaurant can have a bad day. However, after talking to some friends and reading some of the reviews online, I feel like my complaints are more a regular thing than an anomaly.Being a Monday morning, I wasn't expecting there to be a line, but there was. I'm okay with that. We waited 2.5 hours in Denver at a place called Snooze, but the food and the service made me forget the wait. I can wait for a good dining experience. So a 45 min wait in the cold wasn't that bad. However, when we walked into the place, we were immediately yelled at by a rude kitchen worker for standing in the wrong place. I had to bite my tongue because she was going to be touching my food, and we had been waiting way too long to get kicked out 5 feet from the register. When we got to the register, the worker was impatient and didn't give us anytime to ask questions about the menu. \u00a0Her attitude was as if we were bothering her by asking questions. \u00a0The girl serving the drinks had an expression on her face like she would rather be doing anything else other than what she was doing. My girlfriend was so rushed that she ended up settling for something she wasn't really excited about ordering. Having said all of that, I am a very patient and forgiving person. I can put up with all of that if the food is to die for. But sadly, it wasn't. I got the red beans with a side of cabbage and collard greens. The food was very bland. I had to cover it in salt and pepper and hot sauce to allow me to enjoy it. Their \"famous\" ham, wasn't even in the top 10 of baked ham I've had in south Louisiana. \u00a0My girlfriend's jambalaya was just not very good either. Maybe I've been spoiled by really good Cajun food, growing up here. And maybe tourists from out of town would enjoy this because they don't know any better. But for someone who enjoys good food coupled with a good dining experience, this was just one big disappointment. It was such a bad experience that I was tempted to tell everyone in line to not waste their time and go somewhere else. There was a sign on the wall that said no tipping. And that probably sums up the root of the problem. The workers are likely underpaid and under appreciated. I would rather leave a big fat tip and enjoy my experience than not have to tip and suffer through such a lack luster eating experience. Will probably never return to eat here.", "Date": "2013-12-31", "Author_Location": "Houma, LA"}, {"Author": "Jay E.", "ReviewID": "blfFTDJMyPuaQOuH0Skwog", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Don't let the cover fool you.

Here is the rundown:1. Crawfish Etouffee- Order only if you are looking for something extremely bland and overrated. While I am no Cajun food expert, I would like to think I know how a business works. There is a reason every single employee recommends a certain dish at a restaurant: either its the best item on the menu or it is the most profitable. This is the latter. I also have a sneaking suspicion that the mild bout of food poisoning I had to fight through for the remainder of the trip (and still am) was a result of this dish but cannot be sure, so please do not read into this too much. It would take a lot more than a little food poisoning to ruin my time with the group we had. 2. Shrimp Po Boy Sandwich- Bland. Notice a theme here?3. The good? The few members of our group that were happy ordered the jambalaya and one of the guys really liked the fried chicken and the original po boy sandwich he ordered (he also spent $37 on his meal).I won't complain about the prices too much as there are still lines out the doors. Proves that people are willing to pay whatever for reputation albeit a reputation based on past year's quality (I did). I also won't complain about the service. Your don't come here for the service. I live a block down from the Wiener's Circle in Chicago where yuppies lineup down the block at 3am to get thoroughly berated by employees for some of the city's best drunk food. Google it (you're welcome in advance). If you're looking for good service and a pleasant family dinner I am positive there is an Applebee's or some other boring chain nearby. Here is a perfect example of a once-quality restaurant growing too fast, too quickly. I can imagine that at one time this place was amazing and warranted a 5 star rating and its reputation as a local gem. The sheer volume of customers have made the owner very rich (telling by the Bentley parked right outside) and the food very bland. The only thing I came here for is some great Cajun comfort food done exceptionally to cure my Bourbon street induced hangover. I did not get that. Bland and overrated.

Bread pudding is fresh at 1030am, but I hadn't had breakfast, so I decided to sit with a bowl of grits and wait.Piping hot and perfect flavor and texture. I like to bury two pads of butter right into the core of the piping hot bowl and let them melt down before I mix together the salty butter into the perfectly cooked grits. I treat myself to one (or two or three) heavily buttered bites before I complete mixing the two ingredients into a more proportionate ratio. YUM. Creamy, hearty, filling. Plan to share!My Mom joined me shortly after I'd started my grits and got in line for the bread pudding. The woman at the register was real nice, actually called to me to ask if I was ready for my order, not realizing the next woman was my mom! She didn't forget about me. So damn sweet and attentive.Years ago, I saw a famous person here, Woody Allen if my memory serves me correctly, though it's very foggy.Weekends (Sunday's) are especially busy, but weekdays seem to be at a perfect pace.And as for the bread pudding...

Get in line, place your order at the register, and wait for your plate to be brought out to you. They've got all the staple Cajun/Creole dishes, like gumbo, po'boys, fries, etc ...I went for their most famous po'boy, the Ferdi, which is loaded with ham, roast beef, and debris. Now, debris is Mother's term for the pan-bottom scraps of roast beef that have cooked in the drippings during the roasting process, so these pieces are loaded with flavor and juice. Flavorwise, the sandwich was good, but it tasted flat. There were no dynamics to it, no dancing of heat or depth that I was expecting of a sandwich of such purported caliber. Also, there was too much jus that came along with the sandwich, rendering the bread really soggy. I'm all for a wet sandwich, but this was too much. Also, the meats were a bit cold, which I was not expecting. Maybe that's the style, but it would be miles better if they used hot meats. Dining suggestions: load up the Crystal on it for some kick - you'll need it.After that, I felt a bit let down. I saw a cop and a dude sharing a table near the door, so I asked them about Mother's and what the locals thought of it. Turns out, the one guy was the manager, who admitted that the place was catering to tourists and that locals really don't frequent the shop.

Since our hotel is pretty much across the street and we saw lines morning and evening we had to try it out.We showed up around 8:30pm and waited less than 10m outside. The line inside took longer, maybe 15m. We get to the cashier, pay for our food and drink, and then we don't know what we are supposed to do. We sit in the back room, the waiter come and pick our ticket and drop it at the kitchen. After waiving him he told us we have to get our drinks upfront. An other line, shorter, the drinks lady was not there when we paid but the cashier should have told us to wait for her.We wait probably 20m+ for the food to arrive. In the mean time the table next to us waive a waiter about their fried chicken, which let to some argument between him, the waiter assigned to the table, and the restaurant manager. Not very professional to argue in front of the customer. The couple that was before us was still waiting for their order when we left: they ordered fried chicken. It looks like the fried chicken is only cooked on order, but hen only when the waiter bring the order to the kitchen and for the kitchen to pick it up. I recommend the manager to have the cashier to trigger the fried chicken right away when it is paid for. This would cut at least 15m to the customer wait. Also since their are always fried chicken orders and that it takes so long, I don't know why they can't have some chickens in the frier at all times. Just to make sure the waits won't be so long.One if the waiters from the front room was throwing dirty dishes in a bucket near us and that was really loud and annoying.Now we did get our food and we cannot complain about our waiter, he was prompt when called and looked professional. I can't say as much from the other waiter, looked like there was some tension between them. Most of what we order only needed playing (gumbo, soup, \u00e9touff\u00e9e, sausages) the only thing done to order was the fried seafood. It should really not take that long.The food was tasty and plentiful, but not outstanding. The staff could be a little more professional in general (keep arguments away from the customers), make less noise when clearing plates, and improve the soft drinks issue (why a line for that).If they can improve the time to plate and serve the turnaround will be faster and the wait lines shorter...

All I can base the review on is what it is now. It's a sandwich shop with a really long line most of the time. We stopped by on a Sunday at 5:30, there was very little traffic, and we got the Ferdi which is the signature sandwich, apparently. They are slow. I'm going to say that up front. If you're in a hurry, I'm sure this will annoy you. If you're on vacation, then there's probably no rush. They take their time either way.We got 1 sandwich and split it. We got it to go and took it over to the little Roman fountain and sat in the sun and ate it. They put the stewed meat on the side so it wouldn't make a mess of the bread & the bag, which was nice. We slapped it all together and almost made a total mess of ourselves but managed not to dump and of the juice on us. It was very good. It wasn't great, it wasn't awful. It wasn't overrated or underrated. It was good. I'm glad I didn't wait 30 minutes in line for this, so I would say to go on off hours and enjoy it then. In reading other people's reviews I wish I had gotten the bread pudding but at this stage I may explode if I keep eating 4-5 meals a day down here. The sandwich itself was tasty, the pickle-based slaw was a good contrast to the meat. The juice of the meat made the sandwich. Without that, it would be ordinary at best. The meat was good, but not seasoned particularly well or anything. I have to think that if there's a long line, it may not be worth the wait. They also do a turtle soup apparently but it was out the day we went. There are surely worse places to go and the guy at Newark airport even said he wished he could go there again.

Get it if you come here. It's flavour is perfect and its served on a bed of rice. Such a nice change to have crawfish that isn't frozen to kingdom come. The gumbo was alright, personally I think I make a better gumbo. They had oysters in it which was kind of different, but otherwise there wasn't anything super special about it. It too is served with rice. The jambalaya had an overwhelming taste of crystal hot sauce. It kind of took away from the rest of the flavours. It's a shame because I think if they used cayenne instead it would have been a pretty good jambalaya. I didn't really like the fergi sandwich. Personally I found it dry and not tender. Then again, I've had my share of melt in your mouth Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, so this was like watching high school football instead of the NFL.

I ordered the famous Ferdi Special (Mother's best baked ham, roast beef, debris and gravy), as well as a small cup of seafood gumbo.

Needless to say, for those of you who have a saltier palate you may not enjoy Mother's as much. Anyhow, the crawfish etouffee is really good. The crawfish is fresh and they give you plenty of it! The red beans and rice is delicious. You can't really mess up grits, so those were good as well. \u00a0My Famous Ferdi Special po'Boy was huge.

Now, I got an earful for picking Mother's because this was supposed to be expensed, and I picked such a dive. But seriously, the rest of our party was pretty lit before we came. If I recall correctly, we all had at least 3 pints of beer and 4 shots of Jager, and already acting goofy (my tolerance is a bit higher than these guys).

In any case, when I visit a new place, I go to Yelp and find the most reviewed restaurant and try to go there. Since one in our party gets nauseous at the sight of Oysters, we couldn't go to Acme Oyster House (#1 in NOLA), so I settled for #2, and here we are.FERDI SPECIAL & MOTHER'S BEST BAKED HAMSo everyone goes nuts over this Ferdi thing I guess. It's their OMG Universe Famous Baked Ham, roast beef, debris (basically roast beef that cooked in its own gravy), gravy, and some mustard, shredded cabbage, etc. Anything with the name \"Famous\" in it means I gotta try it! This Po Boy is monstrous, by the way, Put together, it's probably like a 14 inch sandwich, and it's tall too! So I take this first bite, waiting for the Creole seasoning to make my mouth water, the mustard to heighten my senses, and the oh-so-famous ham to provide even more seasoning and end it with a nice sweet flavor that only baked hams can bring, but......... I waited, and waited. Hm, must be a dud. Took another bite....and waited. Something was wrong here!Normally I blame bread, because bread tends to suck out flavor and inject its own boringness into it, so I removed the bread and tried the oh-so-famous ham by itself. The texture was there, but both the seasoning and flavor were not! Where did they go?! I tried the slice of roast beef, and it too was seasonless and almost flavorless! The mayo and mustards were evident, but even their flavors were getting sort of overwhelmed by the Nothing (Neverending Story anyone?). Seriously, all the meats and the bread were basically acting as flavor suckers, and it really tasted like a water flavored sandwich! Eventually, I had to use some Crystal hot sauce just to get anything out of it. Blah, what a waste! THIS is what everyone craves? I don't get it!SEAFOOD GUMBONow, this was good. The crawfish in it definitely came out (tastes like shrimp). It was a little watery in texture, but the flavors were nice and spicy. The crawfish didn't taste fishy (like my gumbo from the night before), but had a very good shrimpy flavor to it. Seasoning was just ok, it could've been seasoned a little more in my opinion. Solid, though. Believe it or not, I'd still take Heaven on Seven (in Chicago) over this. Maybe it's the fact that Heaven is the traditional chicken/Andouille sausage that adds its own seasoning instead of just crawfish. CRAWFISH ETOUFFEESo, in my mind, this and gumbo seem very similar. I'm sure all of NOLA is about to kick my ass now, but seriously, I think they're similar. They have differences in taste, such as the gumbo being ever so slightly more tangy, maybe because of the tomato base, and etouffee being more...seafoody? I don't know. It had the same great shrimpy flavor as the gumbo, but it was a little thicker and a little spicier, which I liked. Also like the gumbo, I wish it was seasoned a little more. I added some Crystal hot sauce to this, and it gave me my seasoning, but the additional flavors were unwelcome. ANDOUILLE SAUSAGEGot a separate order of some of these, and I was kind of disappointed. The flavors weren't as strong as I would have expected, considering that the Andouille in other dishes I've had was very pronounced. Here it was kind of dull. The texture was also interesting. It felt like it wasn't quite packed as tightly as, say, a polish sausage or even a brat. I was really hoping for more spice and seasoning, but it was lacking. It didn't even really have a pungent flavor either. It seemed very conservative and timid, which was completely unlike our party, since us drunk fools all had a couple more beers at Mothers! LOL!MOTHER PLEASE!I am very disappointed in the #2 most famous joint in NOLA. The bartender at our hotel even told us that Mother's is sort of an overpriced letdown. I couldn't agree more.

I liked the old feel about it, the casual \u00a0no-nonsense vibe, and the simple yet very tasty food[1]. This place is somewhere in between a restaurant, a diner, and a cafeteria.Ordering food here is somewhat cumbersome:- you stay in a line to order the food,- you stay in a line to pay,- you grab a seat wherever you want and- wait until a server comes and gets your receipt and will then bring the food to your table[2].I tried their Ferdi Special with baked ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy ($10.75). This po-boy is large enough to be shared. This is an excellent po-boy: the ham is tasty and tender, and the roast beef juicy. The debris ( i.e. \"the roast beef that falls into the gravy while baking in the oven\") sounded really yummy but was kind of lost in the po-boy. My only complain is the bread: I think this sandwich could definitely use a bread with a crunchy crust rather than this limp, industrial quality French bread[3].The jambalaya ($6.25) was perhaps the best I've had in NOLA: simple, packed with flavor, and yet each ingredient kept its own identity in this dish. Also, the rice was cooked to perfection, with the grains nicely separated.The turnip greens side ($3.25) was decent, and the bread pudding ($4.75) surprising: the consistency was very soft, unlike any of the bread puddings I've tried at any of the West Indian places in Brooklyn. I enjoyed it.Mother's is certainly not cheap for such a no-frills place, but it's worth a visit. This place is very popular: come early, and be prepared to long lines.----------------------------------[1] AND they share their recipes! mothersrestaurant.net/re\u2026[2] This whole ordeal is somewhat reminiscent of Katz's Delicatessen in New York City: yelp.com/biz/katzs-delic\u2026[3] This seems to be a constant for po-boys in NOLA, though.

That's the cherubic \"Man Vs. Food\" guy who keeps getting into those food-eating contests at various dives throughout the country. I don't think he did his Big Easy contest at Mother's, but he must have tried one of the sandwiches here, which immediately labels this place an instant emporium of unhealthy gluttony in my book. Mother's does have a reputation for its $10 Debris Po' Boys, which use the meat that falls off roasts as the basis for the filling. That sounded like pure gristle to me, so we both went for the $10.75 Famous Ferdi Special, which puts their home-baked ham, roast beef, shredded cabbage, and yes, the debris, together into a soft roll that was then doused in a watery gravy (see photo). Our verdict...it was alright, kinda on the ho-hum side for all the meat provided, especially what they proclaim to be \"the world's best baked ham\".I was not feeling it, although the $3.50 plate of French Fries helped (see photo) since it was quite a pile and piping hot to boot. I also had a $5.25 Garden Salad, which they inexplicably put in a bowl way too small to mix any of the ranch dressing in there with ease (see photo). Rather outdated and probably proud of its traditions, Mother's is a surprisingly small place considering how long it's been on this corner of Poydras Street.

The \"institutions\" usually disappoint and Mother's is no different. \u00a0First off, the establishment has a sign that says, \"No tipping.\" Hmmm... sign of an old New Orleans \"institution\" taking advantage of the city's predominantly minority working poor population. I digress. I'll get off my social justice soap box. \u00a0Although That alone sickens my stomach. One of the other repercussions of service industry workers not making tips--- HORRIBLE service. Not all the employees suck, but the one that did suck sucked a whole whole lot. \u00a0She barely spoke any English-- \u00a0 Which is fine, but coupled with rudeness-- she had no redeeming qualities. I sat at the table for twenty minutes before she told me I had to order at the counter. My party arrives after I do, so I wait for them. We all decide what we want from the mediocre selection. We stand in line to order. I had to go outside to feed the parking meter. I come back five minutes later and five to six people are blocking the entrance. I politely say \"excuse me\" and enter the restaurant. The man at the door asks if he could help me with the sound of annoyance in his voice like I'm loitering. \"With what?\" I replied, irked myself because the man looked like a tourist and his tone was sarcastic. I guess he was the manager. \"The line is outside.\"\"Yes, but my party is inside.\"I felt sorry for the five customers \u00a0outside in the cold weather. Especially since there was room inside for them. We sit down at our table and realize we have to get our coffee upfront. It would've been nice if the people gave us our coffee before we walked off.The non-English speaking waitress(?) brings out my pancake. It was not hot or even warm or fluffy. It was so cold that the \u00a0butter (which was cold too) wouldn't melt. I alerted the waitress(?). \u00a0I also asked her for syrup. She picked up the plate and put her hands-- palms and everything on the pancake, flipped it over with her bare hands and said she'll get it warmed up. Vomit. I got up to peek in the kitchen to see if they were really going to warm up the molested flapjack. She brought out a better than worst replacement-- without bringing syrup. I asked for syrup. She said it is coming. No, lady, the phrase should be, \"I'll be right back with the syrup.\" Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Waitress goes to the food window at least five times to bring other people food, but never my syrup. I ask two other waitresses. \"It's coming.\" I'm starting to think the servers expect Mrs. Butterworth to saunter in and help. Finally, I almost lose my cool and say, \"I've asked for syrup ten times! My pancake is going to get cold again.\"When the Holy Grail arrives, I finally get to eat. $4 for a single ala carte pancake that tastes worse than McDonalds. The other breakfast food items are set out cafeteria style. Which definitely makes this a literal \"institution\"-- but, I've had better institution food-- hospitals, school cafeterias, Navy bases. I'm not sure what the operating costs of those institutions versus this \"institution\" are, but where is the revenue for overpriced mediocrity going? It's not for quality ingredients that's for sure. Hopefully, my optimistic aunt is right and they servers get paid a livable hourly wage. If the food was good, \u00a0the trade off for the poor service would be rectified. Heres the deal though-- as a service industry vet, if I am making a low hourly and tipping is verboten-- I'd give lackadaisical service too. If you like long, bitter cold waits outdoors, enjoy low-grade, warmed up pre-packaged food, appreciate bad service and champion for social injustice, by all means, Turista, come eat here. I'd feel guilty about such a scathing review, but there will always be enough Turistas to keep this place going strong. \u00a0And maybe, just maybe the operators of the institution will eliminate the \"no tipping\" rule if we as patrons, visitors and tourists start to question why we can't compensate people for their services.", "Date": "2012-03-11", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "John L.

The restaurant inside is HUGE (self-seating) and the line to order your food inside is basically the only bottle neck.--Famous Fredi's Special ($11.75)--MUST TRY! This is what Mother's is known for! This sandwich is basically a huge pile of meat all placed between a french roll (which is also dipped in meat juice)! SO hearty and satisfying! What kinds of meat you ask? A variety: black ham, thick slices of roast beef, and of course the DEBRIS! When they described it on Man vs. Food - I was a little disturbed. The bits and pieces of left over meat - how can that be good? IT IS! TRUST! Its like a juicier version of pulled pork - soft and slow cooked! Make sure you get a stack of napkins - because this sandwich can get MESSY. With the meat juice, shredded cabbage, globs of mayo + mustard, gravy, and of course the layers of meat, you will have to wipe with each bite.

The omelete was filled with bell pepper, turkey, red onions, and mushrooms. This was the blandest plate of food ever! I had to salt + pepper with each bite! Not only that, the topping to egg proportion was too little and the entire plate was covered in grease! I did enjoy the taste of grits - which I'm not used to! Felt like home in my belly! :) I also got to try Mother's famous jam with my toast.. but all in all, this is a dish to avoid.--Combination Platter ($19)--Yes we're tourists and we want to taste everything. So what better way than to order the combo platter which comes with Jerry's Jambalaya, etouffee, red beans, vegetables, and potato salad!? This plate is a blessing because you do get to try so many dishes - but after tasting these same dishes elsewhere in NOLA, I can tell you this combination platter may not be worth it. A lot of the food @ Mother's just tasted really mushy, goopy, and a little bland. The etouffee was one shining star on the dish - which was very flavorful. I think one downfall of this dish is that all these dishes are plopped onto the same tiny plate and the flavors get lost in the mix!--Mae's Gumbo Cup ($6)--A small little cup of gumbo - which tasted homey and less salty than other places.

It's a cute, homely place, with a mostly pleasant wait staff, and was actually the first taste I ever got of the city (yes, I'm one of the few who came here sober). The problem really is that their signature items just aren't really that impressive, at least not as much as they were when they first became famous for them, so you build this ideal up that will inevitably be shattered.That was certainly the case for me with their famous \"Ralph\" sandwich, consisting of baked ham, roast beef, gravy, cheese, and something they call \"debris\", which is essentially the juicy run-off that you get from the roast beef as it's cooking. In theory this should be an overly indulgent and somewhat hedonistic pleasure-pile of meats with enough wetness to make it go down super easy. It falls short on the meat, and comes up extra on the soggy, to just leave you feeling a little limp.The real problem is that the main components of this legendary sandwich are just all a bit bland in their own individual roles, so combining them together doesn't really bring out the desired effect. I mean, just look at the bread and cheese (flickr.com/photos/wedoit\u2026) ...it doesn't get much more basic than that in the culinary world. The ham (which has become famous in its own right) was the one saving grace, providing a pack of a punch that I wish the roast beef had followed up with. But the biggest disappointment was this debris that is so hailed as the secret ingredient that makes the whole thing worth ordering. It just added very little whatsoever, other than dampening the bread, which I suppose was a good thing since it was so plain.It's a good, filling meal, and if you time it right you won't have to suffer through the touristically torturous long lines. The price is pretty fair for what you get, by New Orleans standards, so if you really must check this one off your list at least it isn't too much of an inconvenience.

The first night I was in New Orleans, I visited Mother's.I tried the Debris with pork sandwich at Mothers. It was good. Was it as amazing as I had heard.... well no. I liken Mother's to Phillipe's French Dip sandwich in LA. It's a place you need to visit when you are in the city, but in terms of a fantastic meal that is beyond anything you have ever tasted, it certainly falls short. Perhaps I lack the sophisticated taste buds of so many fans of Mother's, but the flavors did not seem complicated or exceptional in any way. My memory of the sandwich was that of a fairly salty sandwich with a good amount of meat. Nothing really interesting. I actually did not eat my entire sandwich due to the saltiness of the meat. I gave the large remainder to my colleague to finish. I have had much better sandwiches than this in places that are much more obscure. To say the least I was disappointed.Food: 2/5If it were not for the fact that it is a fairly famous place in NOLA, I would say Mother's is kind of a boring restaurant. The restaurant has brick walls and a cafeteria style counter. The walls have pictures of people and places and reminded me of an Applebee's. Maybe Mother's was different before it became a tourist destination, but it really has no character in my opinion. It looks like a tourist trap. All that's missing is a giftshop counter.... oh wait there is one..... With all criticism aside, the restaurant is clean and the management has worked to make it family friendly and amiable.Atmosphere: 3/5For myself, Mother's was an acceptable value. It was a big sandwich, and I couldn't even finish it. The price was not wallet busting, but it wasn't an everyday meal either. Personally, I think you can get better value at other places, but Mother's is acceptable and hence average.Value: 3/5I had no problem nor exceptions to the service. The servers themselves did not seem too happy, but then again it was fairly late -- and I'm sure they have to deal with plenty of drunk idiots late at night. Aside from that Mother's is a fairly self serve/pay-at-the-counter sort of place. So service may not even be applicable.Service: N/AOverall I was not impressed by Mother's. I'm not a connoisseur of finer Louisiana cuisine, so I don't have the taste buds to distinguish the difference between layers of salt. In my opinion, I think excessive salt use is a sign of poor quality and lazy flavoring, but many true Americans would disagree. I am sure in future visits to NOLA I will be returning to Mother's when other people I am traveling with demand it. I will, however, not expect much because I now know it is almost all hype mixed with a heaping bowl of salt.", "Date": "2012-08-01", "Author_Location": "Tempe, AZ"}, {"Author": "Holly C.", "ReviewID": "F0F8H58JPnt5pE5T21tw7A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "3.5-4 stars for Mother'sConsidering how long the line was (and it was Mardi Gras Eve), the line moved pretty quickly.

It's in NOLA's business district which looks more like the downtown of any other city, yet on a hot Saturday afternoon when the area was pretty desolate, the only people I saw were the ones waiting on line outside of Mother's.We walked in and saw a big line and a cafeteria-style display of Mother's meats, soups, and other foods. However, unlike what we expected, the display was just a tease and the line was only for placing orders with the cashier. Between the time we got on line and the time we had to order, we had about 5 minutes to go through a massive menu that had too many attractive things to choose from. When I got to the cashier, I spent about a minute muttering various words like po'boys, fried chicken, jambalaya and biscuits without making any sense. I could tell from the cashier's unsympathetic expression that I wasn't the first one to be overwhelmed by choices so I ordered the Ferdi Special po'boy and a cup of seafood gumbo. After ordering, we looked for a table in the deceptively wide-open space. There are 3 dining rooms in the restaurant, and the further you go back, the newer and more sparsely decorated they get. We sat way back in a room that looked like an old warehouse and probably gets used for private parties. After about 10 minutes of waiting, a server took our receipts and brought out our food. The Ferdi Special is one of Mother's specialties and is a po-boy filled with the restaurant's amazing ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy...Mother's proudly advertises its ham as \"world's best\" and it is reallly good, thickly sliced country ham. Of course, I was curious about what \"debris\" was and found out it's basically meat drippings from the roast beef slathered in the sandwich..and now I will be putting debris on everything. \u00a0Altogether, the Ferdi was like a hammy french dip sandwich with gravy on the bread. What heightened the sandwich into legendary status for me though was the crunch of cabbage, mayo and mustard. I recently discovered how good cole slaw can be on any meat sandwich, and Mother's cabbage concoction added the texture and creaminess that took this po'boy to another level. The seafood gumbo was flavorful but for $6.25, the portion I got was really small and kind of disappointing. On the other hand, my friends' breakfast food looked amazing, and the biscuits you get are handmade, big, and fluffy. On top of all that, we shared an order of the decadently sweet bread pudding--one bite was enough for me. As we walked out stuffed, shrimp po'boys, fried chicken, and ham from other tables stared at me, tempting me to move to New Orleans to be close to Mother's.

But, and this may sound weird, I recommend that you visit Mother's. Definitely a New Orleans \"institution\" and you will definitely have a \"feel\" for the city's food here. I am not a naysayer or pessimistic and have no hatred of this place. It was just less than what I expected (and I didn't expect too much). Everything is produced in great big batches (e.g. the gumbo and the jambalaya which were both so-so, but had a more than expensive price tag to them) which destroys the authenticity that Mother's (and NOLA folks) preaches. I guess this place is something equivalent of an In-N-Out in terms of local pride. For example, I love In-N-Out and think it's one of the best hamburger places in the world but out-of-towners and those who did not grow up with it think that it is so-so. Well, I think Mother's is so-so and there was nothing special about their food. I expected a lot and I expected authentic debris!! But it's fake =(As you wait in line - I waited about 20-25 minutes for my meal - you will \u00a0love the Line Nazi. That particular day, it was this fat, John Goodman looking guy who was monitoring the line and the door. And every few minutes or so, he would yell something along the line of \u00a0\"everybody keep straight, one single file.\" The crowd and I loved it. But he was somewhat friendly though if you dared strike up a conversation about him. Mass-production is the word (or compound word if you want to grammar Nazi me) that describes Mother's food. For example, the debris isn't authentic due to the sheer volume of people they obviously service. Debris is(are) the little pieces of beef that naturally fall or flake off when making a roast. Since they don't actually have real debris (or at least enough quantity of it), they use the entire roast itself as drippings, destroying the authentic-ness of it. Well, I am assuming that this place was, a long time ago, a small mom-and-pop operation but is now a big, established company. And once companies become established, they lose essentially the traits they had when they first started. For example, the amount of debris you get in one sandwich is the equivalent of all the debris that is produced when roasting a 10-15 lb. roast. Heavily over-priced but that's typical of all the touristy places in New Orleans. You get a good size amount of food - the portions are big for the average person but I was still hungry after the big sandwich. The seafood platter is $18 and wasn't worth it. It did come with a lot of food but it's just fried food but nothing special about the batter nor the frozen shrimp or previously frozen oysters. If they were all fresh, then sure, but not when frozen. The cool thing is that you can go to the bar, order a Bloody Mary, and then enjoy it while passing time waiting in line. Completely legal and actually recommended by Mother's (and your mother as well).The Ferdi Special sandwich which was so-so. It comes with ham, roast beef, gravy, and drippings. I loved how it was huge and messy with au jus dripping everywhere. Just loved it. But then, in terms of taste, it was so-so. The sides were decent as well.Here are some cool facts straight from their website:In a single year, Mother's serves up:No less than 175,000 pounds of ham and roast beefMore than 40,000 pounds of turkeyA staggering 30,000 pounds of homemade sausageQuarter of a million biscuits (and even more eggs!)A whopping 90,000 pounds of jambalayaSome 25,000 soft-shell crabs and even more shrimpNearly 250,000 pounds of cabbageAn incredible 150,000 loaves of French breadAs many pies as there are ships passing through the port of New Orleans (3,500)A spicy 1,500 gallons of Creole mustardAnd an honest ton of hot pepper sauce", "Date": "2007-10-14", "Author_Location": "Costa Mesa, CA"}, {"Author": "Dennis S.", "ReviewID": "G5K1uPzGANoeP_PWcG8sUg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Many institutions are overrated.

It only took about 10 minutes to get our food and I immediately started into the sandwich. It was very messy and unfortunately not as flavorful as I had expected for something consisting of debris, which is the roast beef that falls into the gravy while baking in the oven. One of my sandwich halves had only a small amount of ham and it could have used some salt or other seasoning to bring out the flavors a little more. Overall, I would not be likely to return to try this sandwich, but I would go back to try something else like the jambalaya that looked really tasty. I would give the food 2 stars and the service was very friendly and is the reason that I am giving this place 3 stars instead.", "Date": "2014-01-05", "Author_Location": "Austin, TX"}, {"Author": "Ryan H.", "ReviewID": "rxfm1mEJ-CrpVWDn2ZXzpA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was not impressed with mothers.

The ettoufee was also good, but we made chicken ettoufee after watching Tyler's Ultimate of New Orleans. The ettoufee we made was better than Mother's...believe it or not.

Most have been yummy fried seafood sandwiches in great white French bread with lettuce and mayo and tomato. Mother's was recommended by a friend as a place to stop in New Orleans, and while stopping to get our bearings at Poydras Ave, we realized it was right across the street and stopped in.You do want to have an idea of what you want when you get in, because you grab a menu and a table and then go up to the cashier and order your food and sit back down.We had the Jerry's Jambalaya and a Ferdi's Special po-boy (2/3 size). The sandwich had some pink ham, some black crispy ham, and the very delicious debris, and was \"dressed\" the Ferdi's way. It was very tasty, and quite different from the seafood po-boys I had tried everywhere else. After reading up a bit about po-boys, I think this is a more \"authentic\" take on a sandwich that has now come to mean any large white French roll stuffed and dressed. The 2/3 size was more than enough for this manly eater and still leave enough to share with my girl.My girl shared her Jerry's Jambalya with me as well, and damn, it was delicious. After trying a few bland etouffees, gumbos, and jambalayas in the French Quarter, this one stood out as being rich, spicy, and not too spicy.I liked that they had a sink and soap and paper towels right out in the hallway, if you wanted to rinse your hands without entering the bathroom. It is a nice touch.Some people have complained here about the high prices and the staff's service. I didn't have any problem with the service, I am used to cafeteria style service at extremely popular spots, and each member of the staff usually has specific duties in order to keep things running smoothly and efficiently. The staff all seem to be in good spirits to me, and I felt welcome. The other thing to keep in mind is that you are forbidden to tip the staff there, so take the 15-20% you should have tipped off of your bill, and the prices are now pretty competitive for food that is authentic and unique.", "Date": "2010-10-13", "Author_Location": "East Watertown, MA"}, {"Author": "Myke Y.", "ReviewID": "DIbCTYqsbs150jfQYHOtcw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like to stay in the Central Business District (CBD) when I'm in New Orleans because it's cheaper than actually staying literally across the street into the french quarter. \u00a0Anyway, there are plenty of walking distance spots like this one in and out of the FQ or the CBD. \u00a0FYI, there is a Staybridge, (part of the Intercontinental hotel family) across the street if you want to shell some $ to stay there and beat the crowds.The poboys are all you need to know about here. \u00a0You can start off with a classic cup of gumbo, but I'd recommend going to Emeril's, NOLA or Acme for that. \u00a0You definitely want to save room for Poboys. \u00a0The fried shrimp, fried oyster, and beef are bomb dot com! \u00a0There really isn't anything bad on the menu. \u00a0Make sure you know what you want when you're up because the lines move fast, and if you pause, studder, or ask what's good, you're out!

I guess my expectations were high based on the reviews and recommendations. \u00a0I was most disappointed by the fried oysters, which unlike another reviewer's experience, mine were very small and mushy, and I couldn't really tell that they were fried. \u00a0On the bright side, the best thing I had was the bread pudding which honestly, based on the presentation; I was not rushing to try it. \u00a0It sat in the bowl looking like a mushy unrecognizable mess (so sorry to say that but it did) but OH it was YumOLicious!So, I would definitely run in for a bowl of that delicious mushy bread pudding the next time I am in NOLA \u00a0but that's about it for me, OR maybe I would give them another try just because it HAD to be an off night, based on the fact that so many LOVE this place.", "Date": "2012-01-22", "Author_Location": "Tucson, AZ"}, {"Author": "Brenda D.", "ReviewID": "r5qcw_iuB2oM0Y88V8Ws3w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the reason I love NOLA - go and try anything on the menu and you will not be disappointed. \u00a0But I highly recommend the seafood gumbo!! \u00a0this is always a must at least once while in town.", "Date": "2013-08-01", "Author_Location": "Weston, MO"}, {"Author": "Lily P.", "ReviewID": "B2AlKUJUPn2sEmeQmC0rcQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great place in NOLA you need to go to in order to try the food.

A side of sausage was good, but a little on the small side for $6, but the Jumbalaya was fantastic - well worth the price of admission...or the price of the dish.Overall, the place was good, not great, but worth checking out. The food is expensive for what you're getting, but it's seriously an experience. It's the closest we've been to the \"please sir may I have some more\" line in a long time and is strangely reminiscent of places like Arthur Bryant's in KC where you're not in prison, but you think it might be what having lunch in prison is like sans the jump suits and fights (according to what the movies tell me).You sit where you like, a nice guy or gal grabs your receipt and brings you your food a few minutes later. Quite nice and they're all very friendly! Worth checking out and you may find something you're pretty excited about.

Who has the best Po'Boy? Johnny's, Sammy's, Mahony's, Mother's, or one of the other 25 places in New Orleans that touts to have the best. Well, I suppose that depends on what you get, but I think there's a reason that it has more then 700 reviews now. It's freakin' good! Went there a few weeks ago and had the Debris Po'Boy ($10), a draft domestic beer (~$3.50), and a large side of Jambalaya (~$6.00). The Debris Po'Boy is da BOMB! I haven't been back to New Orleans since sometime in 2006 (pre-Katrina), but it is just as good as I remember it. Basically, you order at the counter, they give you a stand-up number (to identify your order), you seat yourself, and they bring it to you shortly thereafter. Regarding service, this is not fine dining, and I get the feeling that New Orleans is known for their somewhat mouthy service and less then the cleanest environments. However, if you've been to the city before, you know that's just part of their charm. So, if you can get over yourself and focus on the food (as you should), then you'll find there are some really great restaurants in the city. So, surly service and all (okay...I was wearing a Falcons shirt and maybe that kind of brought that on), the food is damn good. The Debris Po'Boy is served on French Bread (slightly toasted) with the Roast Beef that has fallen off the skewer, is then captured from the juices, and put into a sandwich. I got it dressed, which at Mother's is shredded green cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. Now, the Jambalaya was decent, but I think they put a little too much butter in there so that detracted from the flavor of the Andouille Sausage and spicy chicken and rice. However, it's good to cut the flavor of the Debris Po'Boy with something else. Oh....and we happened to go at a more off-peak time, so we didn't have to wait in a giant line or anything, which was great. So, be strategic about going there. If you roll up on a Saturday at 12 noon...wow...fancy that...there's a line! Come at 2pm, there will be way less people. The bathrooms were moderately clean, so that's a plus for this place too.

The crust was so light and not as greasy as you'd think (I hate it when you bite into fried chicken, and instead of getting a mouthful of juicy chicken, you get a mouthful of hot oil. SICK). And it was seasoned perfectly. LOVED it.The other remarkable thing was that the service was really nice and everyone was super cheerful, and seemed happy to be there (even though they were working on a NOLA holiday and there was a line 300 miles long out the door). I loved that when we pointed out that they accidentally brought us seafood gumbo instead of the shrimp creole that we ordered, there was no attitude, no argument, just a simple \"sorry about that!\" a smile, and they just brought the correct order, no questions asked.

I had a cup of crawfish etoufee and jerry's jambalaya which cost me $14. The two cups came with some bread and butter.

The etoufee was rich, buttery spiced goodness. i soaked it up with the bread. Sounds good right?Then why did I give this place 3 stars then? Well two things: price and the fact that I found better places for etoufee and jambalaya later. My friend, Chris K., ordered the fried combo catfish, shrimp and fries plate and he added the a cup of jerry's jambalaya and crawfish etoufee for $2 more. When I found that out, I felt cheated.

He was particularly excited about Mother's! We ended up eating there twice during our four day stay. The first visit was late afternoon, probably around 3:00. No line like other reviews have mentioned. In fact, there were only a few tables with patrons seated inside. I am sure the off hour was why. Husband ordered the Shrimp Po Boy, he said it was good and there was abundant shrimp on the sandwich. I had the Turkey Ferdi, which is turkey, ham and debris (parts and pieces of pot roast/beef and gravy, tastes like a french dip) topped with mustard, pickles and cabbage: excellent! I really enjoyed the sandwich. My only recommendation for the lunch visit would be a better reference on how the patrons are suppose to order. They tell you at the door to grab a menu and order, but it is confusing as to where you are suppose to order. Especially, when no employee is standing where you ARE suppose to order, at the register, but there are A LOT of people standing behind the food area. I saw patron after patron standing or wandering, looking confused. Trying to make eye contact with the ladies standing behind the food, who never acknowledged them or directed them to the correct place to order. This is not a good way to start a meal. \u00a0When it is busy and there is a line of people ordering, obviously this would not be a problem, follow the line. When this ordering referene is not avaibable, they need to make people feel more welcome and not assume they know where to go. Our dinner visit was a few days later and about 6:00ish. Again there was no line. However, the front of the restaurant was full. My husband ordered the Crawfish Etouffe and I ordered the Jambalaya. We both got the greens, I got grits and he got french fries. Husband said his dish was good, as was mine. Average, nothing over the top, which is o.k. The greens were excellent! Being from the south I love some properly seasoned and prepared greens! Mother's greens were great! However, the grits were some of the worse grits I have ever been served! Watery and NO seasoning whatsoever. No salt and no butter! Anyone who knows grits, knows the water must be seasoned while the grits are cooking. You can not season them afterwards, it just doesn't take for some reason. Therefore, they were not eatable. Mother's is very pricey! Lunch meal was over $40.00 for two of us. and the dinner was about the same. Overall, it was a good meal both times. However, I would never pay those prices at home for the same food. Relative to what our hotel was charging it was comparable. All of New Orleans seems to be ridiculously overpriced. Make sure to do your research before assuming it will be an affordable trip! Our food expenses were our biggest expense for the four days. Overall, I would recommend a visit to Mother's. Try and go during the off hours and you most likely will not have to wait.

You then order your food, pay for it, and then find a seat yourself...the server takes your receipt and gets your food. Friend food takes awhile (like 15-20 mins). The services were inconsistent between lunch and dinner for me (meaning things I thought I was going to get quick that I saw at lunch...too more time). Their backroom (closed during dinner) is pretty cool looking (industrial). But it's like walking into a mom/pop deli with the design they have.

The tired, tanned, and soon-to-be sick version of me was ready for reintroduction to real food (sorry, Carnival), and I couldn't imagine a better place to do just that than Cochon, a restaurant with a reputation for inventive, southern cuisine, and one of Bon Appetit's '20 Most Important Restaurants in America'. Well, they were closed. So, we tried Root, a hip new restaurant receiving a lot of press in the port area recommended of fellow food blogger, Megan (I Run For Wine). Also closed... Damn. How about Stanley's extremely popular brunch? Well, my fellow patrons weren't exactly interested in a one-mile walk in the rain.... it was time to consult a concierge. She recommended Mother's Restaurant, just a few blocks away. In hindsight, while we may have missed some opportunities to dine at a few amazing establishments, we did not go wanting for some delicious, home-style NOLA breakfast.My cousin-in-law (one day, fingers-crossed, hint hint, wink wink, GIVE ME A DAMN RING--I'm only kidding, kind of), Jonathan, and his wife, Heather, joined me in this deceivingly large restaurant, tucked inside an unassuming brick building. The line to order had already formed, so we took our place and perused the menu. After ordering our breakfast spoils, we navigated a variety of rooms, already filled with hungry breakfast crowds, and found a table in the large, open air bar room (and yes, your breakfast can come fully-equipped with a mimosa, bloody mary, or beer). We decided to skip alcohol, at least until we made it to the airport, where there really isn't anything better to do.After the quick exchange of smiles and receipts with a waitress, our food was brought to us as it was ready. Mine was the first to come, and despite attempting to show my southern manners, I dug in after a little encouragement from Jonathan. Say hello to the crawfish etouffee omelet: a fluffy omelet, filled and covered with crawfish etouffee, a Louisiana classic filled with green onions, garlic, sweet onions, celery, Cajun spices, and creamy goodness; mixed with the grits alone, it was amazing. Only a side of fluffy biscuits, grape jam, and an extremely generous amount of butter could improve this situation. It was delicious, and it only put me back $14.

We came to the restaurant in the early afternoon and there was a line leading out of its doors, but the wait did not seem that long, about 20 minutes. Once we got inside, the line leads to a counter station where you order your food. (Water is self severed, literally.) The front of the restaurant does not seem large, but there is plenty of space in the back. After we picked a table, one of the waitresses came by to pick up our receipts to check our orders.Most of our group ordered the 1/2 fried chicken, which includes a breast, thigh, drumstick, and a wing, and according the menu, there is a 20 minute frying time. One of the guys received his fried chicken order within 10 minutes, but the rest of us waited for about 20 minutes. Between my bf and I, we shared a regular sized fried shrimp poboy (dressed with mayo and lettuce) and 1/2 fried chicken with fries and potato salad. I thought the shrimp poboy, about 12 inches, was more on the expensive side, and it tasted only okay, no amazing flavor. The shrimp were large, but I'm not a big fan of really soft bread they used. I felt it was missing that chewy, crispy bite. The fried chicken had yummy crispy skin and it was salted just right. The meat was juicy hot, including the breast meat, but there was no additional spices. My friend thought the potato salad side was good, but the grits needed more salt. My sister said the red beans were pretty good for the most part, but it needed more rice.I like how there is a sink outside both bathrooms for quick hand washing because I have a habit of washing my hands before I eat if I'm not using silverware.

After you sit, the \"servers\" (quotes because they don't serve at all.. bring food, MAYBE, but not serve) ask for your receipt and bring your beverages. That is, if you're lucky. Hubby was given two waters while he was waiting in line, and that was all we got until after our food arrived and we asked for our coffees and milk for Thing 1. She looked at our receipt 3 times to make sure we were actually supposed to have coffee! How rude.. it's coffee!They brought our food and didn't so much as acknowledge the fact that we said thank you numerous times. We literally never had a person come to our table after the food was \"served\". Not once. On to the food.. and let me tell you, the food is the only reason there are even two star up there. The biscuits were perfect. I love homemade buttermilk biscuits, and these tasted exactly like Mom's. The grits were very good, the sausage was tasty and the pancakes were worth the $3. The Debris was nothing more than soggy, greasy roast beef, but Hubby liked it on his biscuit. He got the Shrimp Creole omelette and said he would have been happier with the ham and cheese, but he figured, \"When in Rome..\"Overall, while good, our breakfast was not worth $38.

Each of us ordered the Ferdi Special with debris, and then we split a cup of gumbo and an order of bread pudding. First of all, the gumbo was pretty good and in itself was satisfactory, let alone the HUGE sandwich that is the Ferdi special. It is a gastronomic work of art in my opinion. The sandwich is baked ham and roast beef with gravy, mayo, pickles, and mustard, (I think there was cole slaw as well), and the combination of textures and flavors is surprisingly delightful. The crispness of the cole slaw and pickles works to balance the sogginess of the gravy soaked bread and soft meats.

However, the food is very flavorful. We ordered 1) Taste of New Orleans 2) Catfish Po-Boy and 3) Seafood gumbo. All are prepared with \"true ingredients\", rather than MSG.

The lines (one outside and one inside) are long but the ordering process sneaks up on you. Once you're inside you'll have about a minute to scan the menu and make your choice, cafeteria style. For example, my cashier was taking orders three to four people deep, so make sure you know what you want beforehand! I ended up ordering a regular sized \"Jerry's Jambalaya\". The mix of sliced sausage and pulled chicken added a nice texture - the flavors were there. Our breakfast items weren't nearly as successful. Decent sized portions with a similar quality. The eggs, grits and ham were all OK. My brother ordered the \"Famous Fergi Special\" (a baked ham, roast beef, debris(?) and gravy po' boy) that he ended up enjoying. From what I saw, it seemed like the southern specials (red beans and rice, okra, etc.) were the items to get and the general fair, especially breakfast-wise, should be avoided. It's hard not to picture this place as a tourist trap. Slightly overpriced, fast-paced and completely packed with, well, tourists. Also, whenever a business is overly concerned with their own \"tradition\" I tend to get a little nervous. According to their website, \"in 1986, Jerry and John Amato bought Mother's from the Landry's [original owners]\" and they proceeded to expand the menu... But, with that said, the experience was rather fun. Our server did a great job of taking care of the backroom and keeping everyone (mostly everyone) laughing, despite a rather strange 'NO TIPPING' policy. She greeted us with a friendly \"hello, da'lins!\" and a non-stop gold-toothed grin, right before she sat next to me and confirmed our orders. A refreshing personality.

You are standing in queue while outside and given a menu for you to peruse before moving to a second line which must also wait on inside before you get to a table. While looking over the menu outside you have no idea that you better figure out what you're going to have because once inside the procession only draws you closer to the register as you are corralled in like cattle and told to keep against the wall. Want to ask someone for suggestions? Good luck with that plan because this place doesn't have any servers, just linecooks, cashiers, bussers, and foodrunners. Time is running out so you better make your decision by the time you get to the register or you're going to have a lot of angry people behind you and a lot of people that hate you from behind the counter.My wife and I were down in New Orleans with her parents and we were looking for some place to grab some brunch. The problem is that the fryolators aren't on until 11:00am. Our problem was that we were getting closer to the register and it was only 10:45am. \u00a0In fairness, there were posted verbiage on the chalkboard which confirmed the 11:00am kick, but at the point that you notice you may only ha 2 minutes or less to decide. And even then you may not realize the extent of the 86'd menu items until you get shot down at the register. Suffice it to say that I had to rethink my whole game plan when they shot down my dreams of trying their world class Fried Chicken Special. I suppose it goes without saying that I don't do well under pressure as I ended up with the following impromptu menu items:Bloody Mary - Pre-mixed with way too much Worcestershire sauce, I took a few sips and even after trying to doctor it up with more salt and pepper, I gave up finding it unsalvageable and stuck to drinking my water instead.Cup of Seafood Gumbo - Lots of great flavors from the shrimp, crabmeat, and oysters that make up the \"seafood\" of this classic New Orleans dish. No dish would be complete without the \"holy trinity\" so expect there to be plenty of flavor from the bell peppers, onion, and celery and with plenty of okra for some added texture. By the time that I was done, I wish I had ordered a bowl instead.Cup of Jerry's Jambalaya - I don't care if this was the First Place Winner of the1985 La Fete Jambalaya Cook-off as it was good but nothing all that memorable. On the upside it was moist and not dried out like an overcooked box of Zatarain's that you might get from the supermarket.Cup of Turtle Soup - This was billed as having nice chunks of turtle meat, but I found it to be ground up as is done in other mediocre restaurants. The grinding up of the meat rendered it into unrecognizable bits and I would not be the least bit surprised if they slipped in cheaper cuts of beef and veal in order to cut costs. The soup resembled a cup of the previous night's discarded grease that found its way to my table instead of proper Haz-Mat disposal. I was really looking forward to this but instead was met with complete disappointment. Maybe they should have taken some extra time to clean the mud off the turtles prior to throwing them in the pot.Aside from the Gumbo, I found the entire experience to be underwhelming. It's no wonder that there are many signs which discourage you from tipping. At first I thought that this was management's way of avoiding preferential treatment, but I soon realized that this was because there was no service which could be distinguished to be any better than what you might expect when ordering from the McDonald's or Arby's on Canal Street. If I ever do come back it will be in the afternoon when those fryolators are running and I have access to the other half of the menu that I would have liked if only I had arrived 15 minutes later. But I was not about to wait on that line again just so that I could order the dishes that I really wanted. If only they had actual waiters, then I would have gladly sampled some of the other menu items in hopes of learning why so many people had such rave reviews. But there are so many other great restaurants in New Orleans that I doubt that I'll waste my time coming back.Update:Please note that no other than Jerry Amato, Mother's owner and proprietor, has written back to refute my prior comments which suggested that the Turtle Soup contained anything less than 100% Turtle meat. If Jerry Amato says that it's 100% then I cannot take him at anything less than his word. However, my opinion stands on the quality of the rest of the soup. I know that Jerry said that his Turtle Soup is prepared as per \"local custom,\" but good is good and bad is bad no matter where you go. I really wanted to enjoy the soup every bit as much as the Seafood Gumbo, but unfortunately after straining all of the Turtle meat from my soup, I had no desire to drink the broth... or most of the Turtle meat for that matter.", "Date": "2012-08-01", "Author_Location": "Fort Lee, NJ"}, {"Author": "Samson T.", "ReviewID": "10YFQI-SNn82C1-xd45u9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Mother's was so good we went back and took some to go on the way to the airport. \u00a0I recommend the Ferdi Sandwich with Cheese and the BISCUITS!!! \u00a0I think their biscuits are some of the best I have had ever!", "Date": "2013-05-28", "Author_Location": "Miami, FL"}, {"Author": "Justin W.", "ReviewID": "djB_x4tthTOYlnzsHHecDQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had a tasty Ferdi Special sandwich here; it was quite soggy.

This place was recommended by the driver of the hotel shuttle, so we knew it had to be good. I also recalled seeing it mentioned on the Food Network somewhere, and that's always a good sign. We later found out that Mother's Restaurant was more than just good, it was LEGENDARY. I mean, it's been up and running since 1938 and hasn't changed much since then. Places that stay open for that long are definitely doing something right.When we walked in, I immediately noticed the \"old school\" vibe the place had. I could also tell it was diner/cafeteria style dining, which I didn't mind as long as the food was good. The walls were absolutely COVERED with framed photos of people who were important visitors to the restaurant in some way, whether they were famous, local heroes, or just loyal, longtime patrons. It gave the restaurant that \"family-owned-and-run\" feel for sure.My husband and I decided once again to split an entree because they came with lots of side items. It took a while to decide, as usual, but we finally agreed on the Seafood Platter: oysters, shrimp, and catfish (all fried) plus red beans & rice, grits, jamalaya, and shrimp etouffee--a complete cornucopia of classic cajun cuisine! And WOW was it a lot of food! Even between two people we couldn't finish it all. And as you can see in the photo, the server was cool with us splitting--even gave us an extra plate and everything. Now, most of these foods I've had before in one form or another, except for the fried oysters or shrimp etouffee. Both were awesome. What I liked about the fried seafood was that the breading was light and crispy, not greasy. The jambalaya was nice and flavorful, definitely good. The grits were a bit bland though, needed cheese maybe. And the rice and beans could've used more rice and less sauce to my taste. BUT Overall the meal was wonderful and would certainly recommend Mother's Restaurant to anyone who's in New Orleans and is looking for some honest-to-goodness cajun food with great prices and a no-frills atmosphere.Bottom Line: Come hungry, and don't expect classy surroundings...this is REAL Cajun food!Please visit my blog site to see this review, more photos, and other reviews....roscoenala.webs.com/apps\u2026", "Date": "2011-12-02", "Author_Location": "Orlando, FL"}, {"Author": "Greg H.", "ReviewID": "wuRjHDaSmlPO74wt7lzJ6w", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Years ago, I'd walk in Mother's during the dinner hours and be surrounded by local laborers, fire and policemen.

No way, and that's its charm.

Grits were mediocre but you'd think it would be the most appetizing because of its soul food reputation. The biggest let down was the biscuit. As something I always look forward to, it was disappointing to find out it was not flaky, light, or the right consistency. It was quite dry, mealy, and was tough to go down - even with the butter or jelly. The order staff was unfriendly except one lady that was jovial but she didn't help me specifically.

I also got the crawfish ettuffle since that was the only thing I did not get at the Acme Oyster House. OMG ettuffle is delicious. Not too salty, (which was a problem at Acme), it has a broth which probably has a ton of butter and flour (or some sort of thickener), the crawfish cooked delicately with the flavor of the sea from the crawfish influsing into the broth very distinctly. The crawfish was sweet, tender, and fell apart with minimal effort in your mouth. No tough overcooked crawfish here. The ettouffle comes served over white rice, which when you are paying $8.25 for a small cup seems kinda a cheap move. Why cant they give me a whole cup of ettoufle with a side of rice. There's also another meat, most likely a fish in it. Altogether, this is probably the best thing that I had in New Orleans so far. More than anything, this reminds me of a good thick clam chowder, except with crawfish instead of clams. The Ferdi Special was alright. The broth was kinda flavorless, and to be honest, the best part of the sandwich for me was the pickles and mustard, which was a good combination with the lightly salty meat and gravy. Correction, the best part is the free pepper oil on the side. It was absolutely awesome. Sweet, sour and spicy at the same time, I ended up killing my sandwich with it.  Well the chicken and sausage.The jambalaya is a bit less salty than the jambalaya at Acme, it also has a bit more of a spicy kick to it. An interesting note is that the sausage here is sliced and the chicken is pulled. I feel that this is a bit better than the other way at Acme. The chicken stays tender and chewable, and the sausage (which naturally has more fat gives the jambalaya an additional component almost becoming a compliment to the dish rather than depending on the rice as a mediumHe jumbo however is better at Acme. The chicken in my jumbo is dry, and the jumbo just isn't as flavorful as the darker jumbo at Acme. There is also less meat in this jumbo. The soup is just thinner. It's not as salty or as spicy. Again, the sausage is sliced thick, but in this case, I like it better chopped up like at Acme. Overall, I would say that this place makes the Louisiana classics a lot better than Acme.

So my FIRST night in New Orleans, that was where I headed. \u00a0Very simple set up, almost like a cafeteria in which you walk up this line to order your food and pay. \u00a0You go to a table of your choice and they bring the food to you as you take a number. \u00a0What do I order in the South? Um, a salad? Nope! I go for the fried chicken! Come on! I like the dark meat myself, so that's what I got. \u00a0My friend read on the sign that they are known for ham so she ordered that. \u00a0We sat down and casually chatted and planned on where we needed to go and what we had to see in NOLA.The tables around us included people from other conferences too, tables of 10 or so people all enjoying the food. \u00a0No complains really. \u00a0So here comes our food and what did I think? The chicken was nice and tasty, good flavor with a good crunch. \u00a0I asked for potato salad and macaroni and cheese on the side. \u00a0Potato salad, personally I like a little sour kick to it, not really a fan of the sweetness of it that some places opt for. \u00a0Here, it was nice and tasty, enough mayonnaise and not sweet. \u00a0That was good. \u00a0The macaroni and cheese was creamy and the pasta was just right. \u00a0My friend enjoyed her ham and also got a side of raspberry jam with her biscuit just because. \u00a0That jam is AWESOME! Deliciously sweet and tasty. \u00a0A great find. \u00a0We were stuffed from dinner that we skipped dessert.So we wake up the next morning and opt for breakfast but where? We came back less than 24 hours later for breakfast. \u00a0I got a shrimp creole omelet with grits and a biscuit. \u00a0I honestly didn't care for it. \u00a0It was like they put the shrimp creole ingredients into the omelet after it was cooked. \u00a0It just felt like an after thought. \u00a0I only tried it because I was in the South and figured I have tried other types of breakfast combinations elsewhere. \u00a0And I had grits for the first time. \u00a0I'm from the West, so um, just not my thing. \u00a0Just a bland pile of grains. \u00a0I added a little salt alone, it was OK. \u00a0I tried it with butter too and it was OK. \u00a0I think I like a little sugar because it gives it a little flavor, but not a breakfast item I can't live without. \u00a0My friends and I were so loud that we may have embarrassed a small group of elderly people to the point that they changed tables. \u00a0Oh well, I apologize to them, but we were having fun!So all in all, I WILL come back for dinner and lunch, but breakfast was just OK to me. \u00a0I think if I get breakfast, I will go for the standard items, not a shrimp creole omelet. \u00a0Just a standard eggs and bacon and I'm good. \u00a0Enjoy!

The guy outside dealing with the line was nice even though I'm sure people were irritated with the line, our server who brought the food was nice as well. Had no idea how things worked here since we had never been. Stood in line outside, fine by me, it was a nice day! Stood in line inside , was hectic cause we were in between tables and the kitchen with people coming and going. But hey, works for them so I went with the flow! Again, the staff that takes your orders needs a personality check, they were so rude and rushed us. I understand they are busy but you are in the business of dealing with tourists who have never been. Have a little patients. Order came out wrong cause they didn't listen to the order...

The black ham (which is the \"caramelized outside\" of their famous baked ham) was just OK, nothing spectacular.

I think it has been sitting awhile. It did not taste good. I ended up eating the top portion of the bread only and had that as my sandwich, I just the top as my bottom (they cut the sandwich in half, so I used the top from the other half as my bottom and ended up only eating half the sandwich). The flavor wasn't even that good. I hated every minute of it. But I at least tried it. My husband order the shrimp poboy and he really enjoyed his. It was hot and tasted good when I had a bite.

The building is old so is the inside. This is probably the divest, most casual place I have ever eaten but it definitely brings some character and history. After a long line outside and inside the place, it was time to order. So apparently they are famous for their ham/roast beef sandwich but I would kill myself to go to New Orleans for a turkey'like sub. I then ended with the true cajun experience with a shrimp po'boy, jambalaya, etouffe and gumbo. All items were really good, coming from fresh produce and made in front of you (I am not joking, you walk in front of the kitchen lol). While the po'boy hits the spot, it was fairly basic which I was expecting some secret seasoning or magic cajun remoulade to go with it. The trio bowl as I will call it was definitely a major highlight. Every restaurant in Nola will claim to have the best jambayala or gumbo or etouffe but Mother's is truly good at it. I do mean truly which means that it is probably how people have done it since the old days or like your grand'ma used to make it.

Anyway, having already walked numerous blocks through a pretty dead part of town, I decided to brave the line, which was maybe back to the parking lot and therefore not bad as lines for lunch in NoLA seem to go. \u00a0The restaurant is teeny inside and they let people in by batches maybe 30-40 at a time because that's all they can serve and seat at once. \u00a0This explains why I stood there for a half hour watching like 20 people come out but nobody going in to take their place. I really didn't have much beef with the restaurant - it cant help being popular and indeed I'm sure it's happy about that. \u00a0I did start to want to maim the people standing in line around me, none of whom were from the area, and all of whom seemed to be competing in a death match with a group of Vegas tourists for Idiots of the Year Award. \u00a0The girl in back of me was wondering if she would be able to order any vegetarian food in Mothers, a restaurant that is widely publicized for its baked ham and other carnivorous dishes. \u00a0As it turned out she was happy with some eggs, but standing online for Mothers to get vegetarian food is like expecting steak on the buffet at a PETA convention. \u00a0Veggie Gurl and her pals were also fretting constantly about did they come to the restaurant at a bad time, because it was taking too long in their opinion to get in. \u00a0Ahead of me there was Al advising Veggie Gurl to try the \"debris po'boy\", which he had had before, and which he explained as being the pieces of meat that fall off the baked ham and land in the grease, so the sandwich is ham and grease, and the grease gives it the flavor, and you'll like it \"if you like grease\". \u00a0 Although Veggie Gurl was not interested in grease (and in fact thought Al was discussing \"grits\" for 10 minutes till that got straightened out), I thought maybe I would try the \"debris\" as it's supposed to be a specialty of the house.I finally got in there and placed my order. \u00a0It's a nice little funky cafeteria place with a weird no-tipping policy, and all of the staff who took my order and cleaned up the tables and so forth were extremely nice. \u00a0I had read before that Mother's featured \"surly\" New Orleans service and given the crush of people besieging the place all day and how hard the cookers and servers were working, I would not have begrudged them an attitude in the slightest, especially having to deal with the likes of my fellow linestanders, but the help was nice as pie. \u00a0Absolutely no attitude anywhere, just a lot of honeys and babys and man do I wish I had servers that nice in about 10 other cities. \u00a0I ordered the 2/3 debris po'boy and a cup of etoufee. \u00a0Here's where Miss Information No. 2 comes in: \u00a0the \"debris\" is nothing like Al described. \u00a0It is basically hash in some kind of weird vinegary tasting pot likker. \u00a0It is not particularly greasy, nor particularly flavorful either unless you want to drench it with Tabasco or salt (unfortunately the shaker at my table was empty). It is not identifiable as ham but rather tastes like boiled mystery meat with mustard on it and a way soggy bun, like something you'd get at a bad school cafeteria. \u00a0In short, not worth a 40 minute line stand at lunch. \u00a0The etouffee, by contrast, was A+ five star excellent and I wish i'd just bought a big bowl of that instead, which I will do someday when I give Mothers another chance.", "Date": "2009-03-08", "Author_Location": "Baltimore County, MD"}, {"Author": "Chris N.", "ReviewID": "9dILoj6AHRAOFS4jLU7U7A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Waited a looooonnnggg time to get in this place. ordered what everyone who comes to the big easy orders, Po'boy sandwich.

On the list with a chain of asterisks highlighting it was Mother's Restaurant. Our friend noted that when going to Mother's, we should not be in a rush. There will be lines, he warned, very long lines, but don't be dissuaded, this place will be worth your while. Right before leaving for New Orleans, we mentioned the restaurant to another colleague, who when hearing the name exclaimed \"You just HAVE to bring me some black ham biscuits!!\" as he threw us a twenty dollar bill and grinned from ear to ear. We saved Mother's for breakfast on our last day. When pulling up, we noticed not the building, but the lines of people. \u00a0We grabbed a newspaper and sunglasses and eased into what we thought would be one hell of a wait. Thankfully we were handed menus to salivate over while we stood underneath the blistering sun. Much to our surprise however, the line moved rather quickly. Lofting aromas of what would soon be our very own breakfast kept us intrigued. Once we finally got inside, I was momentarily confused about the setup of the place. It looked like counter-service but there were food runners and waiters scurrying around. \u00a0We ordered from the counter and found a table. Our server was a boisterous woman who asked for our drink orders and then said \"You know what, I think you two need some of my special juice\". We smiled and said OK. The waitress served us a juice mixture of I'm guessing every juice they had in house and it was surprisingly delicious. Maybe even more so simply due to the hilarious nature of the situation. The menu was stocked with mouth-watering treats. We went with the biscuits because we felt it was only right after our fanatic friends' recommendations. Sadly enough they were out of the Black Ham biscuits, something that I now know is an extremely wanted item and in turn runs out quickly. So we went with the baked ham biscuits which resulted in happy bellies all around. The meat was obviously slow cooked and simmered, the biscuits crumbled in our mouths. We even took the 20 dollars of biscuits all 12 hours back to North Carolina to our awaiting friend. Overall Mother's was a delightful experience both food-wise and as far as entertainment.

One thing I like about Mother's is that they have 2 huge coolers with water outside for the guests who are standing in line to get in. I ordered the crawfish etouffee', which came with 2 sides so I opted for turnip greens and red beans and rice. My food was delicious; the turnip greens were seasoned so well and had pieces of turkey inside. I wanted to try the peach cobbles because I heard it was the best and they didn't have any more but offered their bread pudding instead... I decided to pass on that.

Classic new orelans style eatery. I went in due to all the reco's I got. The sign out front says its known for baked ham but they have alot of good stuff in addition to that. Don't be scared by the line out front. The line was about 6 deep outside the door and the server said something about 40 minute wait to get our food which scared some people away. We walked in about 5 minutes and once inside we lined up and was able to place our order in about 5 to 10 minutes. Basically you grab a menu and order at the counter, take your receipt and sit at an empty table. Server will take your receipt, see what you ordered and fetch your food once it comes out. Signs clearly state that servers are not to be tipped (we didn't). Food came out in about 10 minutes. Ordered the Ferdie special since everyone on Yelp seemed to mention it. This place is known in addition to their ham (which to me was tasted like, er ham) for their Debris which is a type of roast beef which resembles moist, shredded beef brisket. The Debris sandwich has this and the au jus like a French Dip. It's pretty damn good. I actually got the Ferdie which is turkey/ham/debris. I also got a cup of gumbo for $6. Sandwiches are large, I can eat a whole but can easily be shared with 2 people if you have a small appetite. So my one knock on this place is the price. $11.75 for the ferdie special (sandwich only, no side) and $6 for gumbo and ~$2 for an iced tea. My friend ordered the sandwich, and etouffee and a side of grits. Our bill came out to $50 (!). I find that to be a lot for a sandwich side and a drink...thank goodness they don't charge tip, but perhaps that's why the prices are so inflated? Also you can get more than just sandwiches.

My husband, daughter, and I went in for lunch yesterday and it was great. I had been there before, but they hadn't. We have eaten at every kind of restaurant in NOLA, but Mother's is in a class by itself. We had fried chicken, gumbo, red beans and rice, cabbage, jambalaya, shrimp creole, and bread pudding. Everything was good, except that the gumbo was a tad salty. We shared among ourselves and agreed that the only disappointment was that we were too full to finish it all. Our daughter, very happily, took home the leftovers. The meat in the dishes was tender and smoky tasting. The cabbage is something I'm still dreaming about. The chicken was crispy and moist. I order jambalaya everywhere and this was some of the best. The bread pudding is out of this world, but too rich to eat alone! It was a great finish after the spicy lunch.
