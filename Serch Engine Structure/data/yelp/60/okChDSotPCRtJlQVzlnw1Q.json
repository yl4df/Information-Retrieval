This time, I tried the pesto sauce on my hero. It is so fresh and good. I do prefer the white sauce, though. I keep bringing more and more people to try this place and it's always a hit! If you're in the area, this is a MUST. The food always comes out so quickly, it's delicious and so reasonably priced. It can get a little crowded here, so if you don't like small places where you might get bumped into, this isn't for you.There are communal tables outside, so if you don't mind sharing a table with someone else depending on your group size (we sat at a table with another group of people and it wasn't a problem for us), it's a great place to be.", "Date": "2014-07-05", "Author_Location": "Nassau County, NY"}, {"Author": "Jeesoo L.", "ReviewID": "BXBM81GkrYeOtNLZt-1Jbw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was expecting a huge wait, but we were seated immediately.

The boyfriend and I were walking home and decided to grab some balls to go and decided on the basic beef meatballs with spicy sauce. They were extremely quick with the take out and as soon as we walked outside, we tried them. Not blown away. They tasted like regular meatballs. Nothing special, definitely didn't live up to the hype. There's a good chance these were over hyped so I expected a magical ball, but the other meatballs could also be even better. r I just figured, if you can't make a basic beef meatball amazing, then maybe your other offerings might not be as amazing as I hoped. All in all, they weren't as amazing as I hoped and imagined them to be. However, I haven't completely written them off and one day I will be back for a proper sit in meal and will try out the other balls they have to offer.

Please scroll right on to the next review (or any of the other 1938 reviews), which is surely more legitimate than mine. But when you're serving something called veggie meatballs, I sure as hell am going to order them, and when they're dry and hard, I sure as hell am going to call you out on it.Despite our late start time, we waited for 1 hour and finally got seated at a table 10:40 PM. The server was pretty sweet and came up with recommendations. I got the veggie balls with mushroom gravy (which I hear now is not veggie) with a kale salad that was bland. We also ordered the risotto which was quite tongue tickling, with light flavours of jalapeno and queso fresco. Unfortunately the roasted veggies of the day brought forth no such culinary sensations, despite the cilantro butter in the description (but not on the actual plate). My friends got the spicy pork and chicken balls, and they rated them a 7 on 10.I also got a corpse reviver #2, which was only 10$, and it was lip puckeringly sour and sickly sweet and funnily rather enjoyable, like eating lemon candy. However the root beer float and the whiskey float were severe disappointments. The ice cream sandwich looked amazing when our neighbours got it but it was way way sweet. One tip though - the chocolate chip cookie is better than the brownie walnut.The hostess is rudeThe balls are drythe cookie too sweetbye-bye.", "Date": "2014-06-17", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Ben C.", "ReviewID": "9on13DwbrqX4bdY7RMfVQQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I mean... where do I begin? \u00a0It's definitely always crowded and hard to sometimes get a table within 30 minutes during dinner. \u00a0However, the food is always spot on. \u00a0Opt for the family jewels, always a welcome addition. \u00a0The polenta was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. \u00a0The prices are affordable and the staff always is willing to help. \u00a0Drinks are fine, nothing crazy.

Heck yeahhhh!I met my friend for dinner here and since it was just the two of us we didn't have a problem finding a table. The menus are cool because they are laminated and you get to check off what you want using an erasable pen. Our waiter was really nice, brought us water right away, and pointed out some of the highlights of the menu. I ordered the the kitchen sink salad with the spicy pork balls and the classic tomato sauce. The salad sounded great because they put the meatballs on top of some greens, which helps you avoid carbo-loading (too much pasta...)Service was pretty fast and the food was delicious! The salad came with chickpeas, beets, slaw, and some sort of pickled cucumber. The salad was fresh and peppery and I don't usually like beets but these were really great because they didn't taste as earthy as they usually do. I ate every single bite of veg on my plate. The meatballs were pretty good, they could have used a few more spices, but the tomato sauce was really yummy. I would definitely come back and try some of their other balls!

The way it works is that you choose one ball (classic beef, spicy pork, chicken, veggie), a sauce (tomato, spicy meat sauce, mushroom gravy, Parmesan cream, pesto), and sides. Side selections include polenta, white beans, risotto, salad, roasted veggies, and a few other sustainable items. We went with the classic beef with classic tomato and \"Everything But The Kitchen Sink\" salad; why have one or two sides, when you can have it all? We also had the spicy pork with mushroom gravy and \"Everything But The Kitchen Sink\" salad. The meatballs were so tender, moist, and bursting with flavor. The mushroom gravy was my favorite, but even the classic tomato sauce was delicious. The medley of roasted vegetables were so divine.

Guess I really need to see what's the rave about.Instead of their most famous meatball, I dived right into the kitchen sink plus added a sunny side egg right on top. The sunny egg, cooked perfectly! Chickpeas were tossed in a refreshing dressing, beets were in a vinegary sauce, both salads were outstanding. Buried under the egg were chicken meatballs that were smuthered in a creamy gravy. I did not even bother cutting into them, I just popped one right in my mouth, I just couldn't wait to try it! It's seasoned well, and very moist. There's more in the plate! Cauliflower roasted till al dente on top of a bed of arugula. So amazingly good that I wanted to lick the plate!For dessert, we all agreed on the snickerdoodle icecream sandwich. Snickerdoodle was cinnamony, icecream was vanilla-ee, sooo satisfying.I'm sorry but one less star for very tight seating! Tables are striaght through and you're side by side with strangers.

They're all generally failed attempts at the traditional comfort foods they're attempting to emulate... but here at Meatball Shop, they've nailed the art of mock meatballs.With what I gather to be lentils, walnuts, breadcrumbs, various seeds, etc... making up this veggie meatball, it has a mouthfeel that stands toe-to-toe with their pork and beef based meatballs varieties, but this version will be a lot more friendly to your cholesterol levels. And best of all - it tastes great! As mentioned earlier, most other veggie knock offs of meat-based products suck. These do not, and I challenge any carnivore to eat a few and not sing their praises. They're not vegan, so if don't consume any animal stuffs at all, you'll sadly have to settle for a salad.

Okay.We both go in for the bite. \u00a0I seriously bit and instantly crinkled my nose. \u00a0What the hell?! \u00a0The owner must've seen my stank face because he came over. \u00a0I asked for differentiation on our sliders (something I think the server should have explained in the first place...). \u00a0So I ended up with two beef and the veg on my plate. \u00a0Joolz has my chicken and pork (which is what she bit into...)Now, my problem here is, what if Joolz was allergic to pork? \u00a0Or it was against her religion (ok, she's Korean. We all know pork is not against her religion. \u00a0C'mon, they're all about ssam gyup ssal, for chrissakes!)?As for me, I'm not much of a bean or lentil fan, which is what these veg balls were made of. \u00a0*barf* So grossed out. Even worse when you're not expecting it.Moving on... the spicy pork meatball - mildly spicy. \u00a0The spicy sauce, not a hint of spicy at all. \u00a0The textures of the meatball are a bit too much filler for me. \u00a0I like a more solid meaty ball. \u00a0All the sliders had sopping wet bottom buns from the sauce, yet I didn't really taste any sauce.All the food, barely warm. \u00a0My broccoli was mushy. \u00a0I thought the risotto was decent, but Joolz thought it was too al dente for her.Owner comes back as we're finishing with a veg and pork slider to replace the ones we ate of each others. \u00a0At this rate, i was just meh over the whole thing. \u00a0Cut a third of it and ate it to be polite and made Joolz eat the rest of it.So, as we found out for ourselves, the way to tell your slider apart - the toothpick frills are color coded:red - beefyellow - chickenblue - porkgreen - vegThe special and salmon balls, you'll have to figure out on your own, since we didn't order any. \u00a0I'd say orange for salmon...Anyhoo, Joolz seemed to enjoy her ice cream sandwich.Bathroom was huge. \u00a0Maybe they could've made a smaller bathroom and then had seating that wasn't so close together. \u00a0I think I might as well have been sitting in the lap of the guy next to me...So not that great of an experience, but I'd be willing to come back after the kinks have been worked out. \u00a0The service - both kitchen and dining room - will probably improve in time.Next time, I'm getting the plain meatballs and no sliders. \u00a0They looked better. \u00a0Oh, and the hero looked tiny! \u00a0Might as well have been a finger sandwich. \u00a0It was only slightly larger than a slider...\"I had takeout from them after this in 2/10 and it wasn't that much better. Yet to go back, but maybe when I run out of other choices or if someone else really wants to go.

For our late night foodie run (this place closes at 2am-4am), we hopped on in, sat at the bar and decided to share an order of the Spicy Pork Meatballs w/Mushroom Gravy. We ordered just the balls by themselves which comes with four normal sized meatballs and a slice of foccacia bread. \u00a0The meatballs have a mild kick to them. They're pretty good as far as meatballs go... juicy and full of flavor. \u00a0I unfortunately didn't find anything too special about the mushroom gravy. It was just any ol' gravy to me. The downside... our one dish was about $8 which is expensive for what it is! Our food came out in less than 5 minutes which must mean everything was already cooked and all they had to do was scoop... right??

The meatball options are beef, pork, veal, chicken, etc. Sauce options range from marinara to spicy meat to pesto.

We arrived at 7:45 (an hour and 15 minutes later) to find out that the table was not ready and that it would take 20 more minutes. \u00a0A little annoyed at this point but we grabbed another quick drink at Arlene's and headed over yet again. Well, the table was STILL not ready and we waited another 15 minutes outside because it was too full inside. Since it was cold, we tried waiting inside and grabbing a drink, but we were told no, its too crowded and we need to wait outside. Ok...? While waiting, our friend had to use the restroom so went inside to wait in line. Well, we saw him quickly exiting and heading next door. Apparently, he was by the one of the servers that he needed to use the restroom at another establishment because he was blocking the servers. Now, 2 hours later when we finally got seated, the server came over to ask if we had any questions about the menu. We did not, but needed time to look over the specials and decide. He came back again, and when we weren't ready to order yet, rolled his eyes.... When our food finally came, it was cold. Overall, a huge disappointment. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the other 5+ times deserve something...right?", "Date": "2013-10-21", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Robby K.", "ReviewID": "-WGWn6ZEcRuT8E1y2ZO__w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went here last night with a friend.

Once we sat down, it felt like a small community of people who enjoy meatballs since we all sat on one long table with other guests. My friends and I ordered a pitcher of the Bitches Brew which was super delicious and refreshing. Hit the spot before I even started eating. I personally ordered their sub (comes with 3 meatballs- I forget the name). The sub was amazing- the meatballs were juicy, the sauce was full of flavor, and the cheese was super fresh. Honestly the cheese was my favorite part because I am such a snob when it comes to mozzarella and this was the best I've ever tasted. The sub came with a side salad, which for my tastes was a little bland, but my two friends LOVED it.If you are ever in town, I highly suggest checking this place out.

I had every single drop of that sauce and It was very very filling. - and one market salad side: refreshing greens topped with vinegar and some goat cheese. Good to offset the heavy stickiness of the meatballs. Believe it or not, 4 meatballs with its hefty sauce and a bit of salad is filled us up to the brim! So there was no space for their decadent-looking ice-cream sandwiches. We sat at the bar and the bar server was quite good at explaining the menu to us. The place is cute and fun to sit in. We would not come back here because meatballs aren't really our \"thing.\" But if you are craving meatballs, you cannot go wrong hitting this spot! Not coming back is usually a 3-star for me but it's unfair for The Meatball Shop because they taste so yummy!

There are three locations throughout the city: West Village, Lower East Side, and Williamsburg-- all open late on the weekends till either 2 or 4AM. While I can't say I've been for a late night post-bar snack, I'm positive it would be a good choice. I've been to the The Meatball Shop on many occasions with different friends who I've wanted to share the experience with, and numerous times with Kyle. If you are ever craving meatballs, or a killer, cheap lunch or dinner, this is the place to go. The staff is friendly and quirky, and the service consistently good. There is usually a wait (ranging anywhere between 10 minutes and an hour depending on when you go) but it's worth it. What I love about The Meatball Shop is how you order. You are given a menu and a black marker, in which you customize your order and hand the menu back to your waitress. You can choose from four options of meatballs: classic beef, spicy pork, chicken, or veggie, and five sauces: classic tomato, spicy meat, mushroom gravy, parmesan cream, or \u00a0pesto. They offer two cheeses: \u00a0mozzarella or provolone cheese (mozzarella, obviously). You can also choose if you'd like your meatballs \"Naked\" (served alone with a slice of focaccia) , \"Smash\" (on a brioche bun), the classic \"Hero\", OR! as sliders. The Hero is my personal favorite and comes on an II forno baguette. My choice is always the classic beef or spicy pork meatballs and spicy meat sauce (the mushroom gravy is also really good but more rich and creamy). The hero is served with a side salad, with crispy sliced apples and a light vinaigrette. Lots of choices and options at The Meatball Shop, but any choice is bound to be a good one. \u00a0The meatballs are made with quality meat and are incredibly flavorful-- slow cooked so they are perfectly tender and juicy. They also offer a variety of sides, including risotto, mashed potatoes, and spaghetti-- all of which were delicious. The ice cream sandwiches are also amazing and not be skipped! They offer a variety of homemade cookies and ice creams in which you can mix and match. They are $5 and worth every penny. They are also great for sharing! Note: I'd recommend going to the one in Williamsburg.

I think I ate the best carrot in my life at the Meatball Shop. I came here on a friday night, but I was early so I didn't have to wait like 2 hours like some fellow yelpers. The waitresses were nice and let us sit wherever we wanted, but the double seats were taken so we just shared the big table with other customers. The place is not big, but it could still fit about 20 something people comfortably. In my opinion, it's not good for groups. They might move some customers for you, but the wait will still be long. Like a lot of people mentioned, they have the check off menu and markers on the tables so you could have some fun and personalize your meal. I wanted to try the different meatballs so I decided to order three sliders: spicy pork with parm cheese, chicken with marinara, and classic beef with pesto. Mmm they were very good. I really liked the pesto and the parm cheese sauces because they were unique for meatballs and blended very well with whatever meat you paired it with. The cheese was warm and melted and the pesto wasn't too oily or anything. The classic beef was juicy and the spicy pork was a right amount of spice. I wasn't too crazy about the chicken and marinara, but there was nothing wrong with it. I just wanted something different at that moment. My friend and I also ordered two sides to share: risotto and the daily roasted vegetables. They were expensive for what they were ($5 for a small side dish) and I didn't think I would pay $5 for a few carrots, but I'M SO GLAD I DID. I didn't know I was eating carrots at first, but when I found out, I was just like \"wow, this is the best carrot I have ever had.\" They were soft, but not mushy and were caramelized or something. Perfect sweetness and blended so well with the nuts it came with (the vegetables come with nuts so be careful of allergies). The lady beside me overheard me by the way and asked me what I ordered. She then ordered the same thing and proceeded to say \"wow, this is the best carrot. Thank you.\" Hahaha I hope they keep these carrots on the menu because they were so refreshing and a good balance for all the meatballs you will be eating. For dessert, i decided to get the cookie sandwich that everyone was raving about. You get to choose two kinds of cookies and an ice cream flavor in the middle. I went with snickerdoodle and oatmeal with mint ice cream in between. Mmm, there is no way someone can eat this as an actual ice cream sandwich cause the ice cream scoop in the middle was gigantic. It would totally break apart and be a mess if you do. Use the tiny spoon they give you and eat it slowly, even though you'd want to just devour it. The cookies were soft and delicious and the mint ice cream was fresh. Dessert was really cheap for what it was also. Service in the Meatball Shop was pretty good. They were good with coming around and asking if everything was okay and whether we needed anything else. I didn't feel rushed when I was there and food came out really fast. The waitress was not annoyed when I asked what the specials were and she was clear and knowledgeable about them too. Overall, good experience here. I would come back and try the other stuff and order the vegetables again.

This place offers ice cream, and my personal favorite desert here, their ice cream sandwiches. \u00a0Now these ice cream sandwiches are not puny by any means, and they are nicely sized, and have the ice cream in between a delicious type of cookie of your choosing. \u00a0All-in-all, I seem to always have a good meal here, and it helps that they rotate spacial flavored meatballs, as I can always go for something a little different. \u00a0They also offer a decent drink and wine selection, in addition to also offering sangria, which you can never go wrong with.Take note though, especially at late night on a weekend, it tends to be very busy. \u00a0Your best bet would be ordering to-go and eating outside, as there are some areas to site near the place, and even across the main street on some benches, so hopefully it is a good night outside.Oh and randomly, the last time I went here was during the day and I told my friend while we were walking around in the city trying to get a taxi and said, \"We should just eat first. let's go to The Meatball Shop, this area looks familiar and it's nearby\". \u00a0My friend then side \"Seriously?

I like to call it a meatball orgy and everyone was invited. The more the merrier I always say! My BF's favorite was the spicy pork meatball with spicy sauce. It had a really nice zip to it and I appreciated that even if you don't like spicy, you'd stil enjoy the kick. My favorite was the plain meatball with tomato sauce. I'm a simple girl and I think a meatball establishment should be able to win your over with the basics! They succeeded! Everything was SO DELICIOUS!!! All the balls were moist, covered in freshly grated parmesan, smothered in wonderful sauces, and served with a slice of focaccia bread.(Photo of our meatball orgy: yelp.com/biz_photos/P4hm\u2026)This location is very small but it's the intimate feel of the restaurant that makes it truly special.

The Meatball Shop has been sitting on my Yelp bookmarks for a couple of months now. It was definitely time to make the trip.It's conveniently located on the Lower East Side, right off Houston.The meatballs are amazing! I was short on time so I opted for the Take Out window. Very satisfied with my choice, although when I have more time I'll come back and have a beer with my sandwich to make the experience that much better. Ordering from their menu is super simple, much appreciated.I ordered the Meatball Smash ($9.75) with the Classic Beef Meatball, spicy meat sauce, and fresh mozzarella on a baguette. As takeout the sandwich served in a cardboard box accompanied by the Simple Salad (Arugula & Apples). It was sooo good. The meatball was nicely seasoned and the sauce had some nice spice. Probably could have been even hotter for my liking. I really enjoyed the fresh mozzarella on top, which was a nice touch. Portion size was spot on, didn't leave hungry or too full.Since I ordered takeout I placed my order with the bartender. It almost seemed as if I was bothering him because I interrupted his conversation with one of the waitresses. This was probably the only downside to my experience at The Meatball Shop. The food came out very fast from the kitchen, which worked out well because I was starving.I enjoyed the meal in a nearby park, perfect on a sunny afternoon. Plenty of parks around if you choose to do the Take Out.

The menu has four different sections. Each with a different number of meatballs, served in a different way: on a hero, in a bowl with focaccia bread on the side, or in a bun. Basically at The Meatball Shop, you can have anything your way. They have fresh daily specials everyday. The market salad that they had that day was fresh arugula topped with toasted pumpkin seeds and ripe persimmons. I ordered a smash which was two meatballs served in a toasted brioche bun. The beef meatballs are delicious! If you're lactose intolerant or just watching your calories, be advised, the ground beef is mixed with a hint of ricotta cheese.

I would end this meal by taking a picture for the dancing people in the back.Instead.....REALITYMy cousins and I are inebriated beyond belief, which prompts us to join the people dancing in the back. After drunkercising for a few minutes, we finally get our rowdy group to sit.Like I said before, there was nothing traditional about the order of our food. We ordered two pitchers coupled with...... ice cream sandwiches. (Yes, we went with the delightful ice cream sandwiches first.) Luckily, one of my cousins had enough remaining brain cells to order some hearty meatballs.The service seemed quick. (I say seem because there is no sense of time in a state of inebriation.) We got our ice cream sandwiches and started to munch away on the cookies filled with creamy ice cream. After we were done, we all had silly smiles, more beer in our system, and ice cream all over ourselves. They were delicious.To complete our reverse dinner meal, we finished my cousin's meatballs since he was out for the count. (My recollection of this moment is fuzzy. I think I liked it since I ate a couple of meatballs, but the beer taste buds were in full affect by this time.)(Maybe, next time I will go with conventional meatball and beer instead of an ice cream sandwich with my beer.)", "Date": "2012-08-07", "Author_Location": "Fort Lauderdale, FL"}, {"Author": "Mona A.", "ReviewID": "ygExD4qR9RcjKq8ghOrqzA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Who would have thought that a vegetarian would fall in love with a place called The Meatball Shop?!?

Now, everyone knows that each person has different taste in balls, but I will offer you mine, in case you care about how my balls taste...er...my taste in balls, I mean. In the order of the balls I most enjoyed having in my mouth to the least: beef balls, spicy pork balls, chicken balls, lamb balls, vegetarian balls. And here I thought vegetarians didn't have balls.**This was not to say that any of the balls were bad; even the vegetarian balls were surprisingly delicious. However, we did not try the salmon balls, because I don't think balls should ever taste fishy.The ball options don't end there; if you order the small ball sandwiches (sliders), they allow you to mix and match the different types of balls with all sorts of ballsauce. Unsurprisingly, she enjoyed the creamy ballsauce the most, whereas I preferred licking the spicy meat sauce off of the balls before stuffing them whole into my mouth. The classic tomato and mushroom ball gravy were both stellar as well.If you're the sort of person who only trusts a girl's opinion of balls, let me just say that my girlfriend swore these are the best-tasting balls she has ever put in her mouth.

All perfect for a fun night out, in this temple of meatballs. It's actually a very sexy wine bar, undercover. The staff handled this crazy pitchfork-in-hand meatball mob like magic. Everyone was bustling around, working hard- and they truly weren't afraid to laugh. It was opening night, after all. Wine list is extremely reasonable.. I enjoyed my Sauvignon Blanc, as my order was prepared. My boyfriend loved his spicy pork meatball hero- which comes on phenomenal Il Forno bread (Crunchy and toasted- yet soft and chewy inside). Such amazing flavors of the nutty provolone, the warm spicy pork, the delicious bread. The salad, which accompanies the hero, is of arugula- with shaved apple slices and a simple vinaigrette. My chicken meatballs with mushroom sauce were DELICIOUS! So tender- I even tasted a hint of truffle oil in the sauce. We split a platter of beef meatballs- atop amazing risotto .. with a side of golden, buttery polenta (which had a little spice). Sauce spilling out over the entire platter... with fresh basil and succulent chunks of tomato.. garlic love. The sauces here are phenomenal- and I truly urge you to try the Classic T and the Mushroom sauces... Especially with a nice slice of focaccia on the side, as a wonderful sauce delivery vehicle.This giant meatball feast was around $30.

Owner #1: \u00a0Yeah. \u00a0Once they come in out of curiosity, they will be hooked. \u00a0Then they will all go on Yelp and make stupid juvenile ball jokes on the reviews which will catch even more people's attention. \u00a0We will be rich. \u00a0Bwah ha ha ha ha.At least that is how I imagined the Meatball Shop's owners conversation went when they decided to make the restaurant's actual logo and name so small (and have it slightly blend into the glass door) while the word Ball is so big and bright red in the windows. \u00a0If so, luckily for them, they also have the ability to cook some darn good food to keep their customers coming back for more. \u00a0 Our waitress was all bright, bouncy, and cheerfully helped my dining partner and I through our initial confusion of how to order using their laminated menus and their erasable marker (which actually wouldn't write no matter how hard we tried). \u00a0She was also a great help with answering our questions about the different types of meatballs/sauces combination and the available sides.Based on her advice I had:SPICY PORK WITH SPICY MEAT SAUCE SLIDER: \u00a0Very large, very tender soft pork meat with a very mild kick of heat between a small soft bun. \u00a0I would have loved a bit more of the spicy meat sauce on it but otherwise it was delicious.CLASSIC BEEF MEATBALLS WITH MUSHROOM GRAVY ON TOP OF MARKET GREENS: \u00a0I had the pork for the slider so I wanted to try a different kind of meat. \u00a0How could you have a meat ball with out trying the classic ingredient of beef? \u00a0Again this was very tender, and soft and the mushroom gravy was mildly creamy with thick chunks of mushrooms. \u00a0The market greens consists of steamed broccoli, leafy greens, soft beets, and slices of sweet apples all mixed with a very nice, mild vinaigrette that doesn't overpower the taste of the fresh veggies. For the side we had the Rigatoni: \u00a0The pasta was very al dente. \u00a0The tomato sauce used here disappointingly reminded me a bit of the canned Ragu sauce. \u00a0Everything was topped by freshly grated Parmesan. \u00a0The dish didn't wow me but it was passable.The dessert. \u00a0You basically build your own ice cream sandwich. Choose your type of cookie from their selection and then do the same with the ice cream to make your own combination. \u00a0We had brownie with mint. \u00a0The brownie portion was buttery soft. \u00a0I love my cookies that way. The mint ice cream. \u00a0Really refreshing and nice. \u00a0It tasted like they had actual fresh mint leaves blended right into the ice cream. Now for the bad portion of the review. \u00a0I ordered the sangria. \u00a0There was more ice in my glass then there was sangria. \u00a0It wasn't very fruity and with so much ice, it tasted very watered down. \u00a0I wouldn't recommend getting this. \u00a0 It was pretty cheap at $6. \u00a0Then again, ice cubes aren't that expensive.The strong point of the food here comes from it being made with simple high quality ingredients. Everything tastes very familiar, almost like home cooked meals. \u00a0No fancy cooking or exotic ingredients from the dishes that we tried. \u00a0Just simple food done right...... but with lots of \u00a0balls.**************************************************\u00ad*****************Photo of the window with the giant word BALL: \u00a0yelp.com/biz_photos/P4hm\u2026", "Date": "2010-07-24", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Matteo R.", "ReviewID": "CLTfiDh_7MjNu164DgzyKA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "\"How long is the wait for a table?\"\"One hour and a half\"No matter what day or time of the day (or night) you come here, the answer is always the same: the wait for a table is one hour and a half.But is it worth it?For a one-trick-pony that serves food that is better appreciated when drunk, the Meatball Shop does pretty well.

I've been talking with friends about going here for months and finally made it with Jade N. Friday night. Yep! I've had the balls.  Arriving at 5:45 this place was PACKED. I put my name down for two and stepped outside. By the time Jade arrived they were ready to seat us in minutes. There's usually a wait, and they originally told us it would be 30. We were seated in less than 5. Awesome.This was my first time at The Meatball Shop and I found the way the menu works interesting. Laminated, you take one of their nifty makers (check the pics) and mark what you want front and back. Be sure not to miss the desserts! Luscious ice cream paired with chocolate chip, brownie, gingersnap, peanut butter or macaroon cookies. Mmm Yum! - don't forget to check the specials menu. Ball of the day ::licks lips:: salad, sides and ice cream. Our waitress approached us after a few minutes and since Jade had already been there, we were ready to order pretty fast (especially me being a rookie). I opted for sliders and a side of mashed potatoes. Jade opted for the Balls Al A Carte. After about 45 minutes of waiting and making idle chit chat with our Italian neighbors, our waitress apologetically told us our food would be out shortly. Embarrassed by the amount of time it took to serve us, a very attractive server/ maybe restaurant manager came over to us to apologize for taking so long and put dessert on the house and offered us drinks gratis. We passed on the sangria since Jade doesn't drink and I don't really either (except for a nice wine or some shots) and opted for their Summer Berry Lemonade. Yum! Jade and I were both very impressed. We hadn't even complained that our food was taking so long. Out loud anyway. Each meatball slider was quite delicious but my favorite was the spicy pork. Don't let the word spicy deter you. It's more of a pleasant kick that makes you go \"Ooo!\" The mashed potatoes were heavenly. Coming from me, that's an uber compliment considering my Aunt makes the best mashed potatoes on earth. Southern style recipe passed down from my Uncle's relatives who were slaves. These were comparably delicious. Creamy/buttery, topped with chives, small pieces of scalloped potatoes I practically licked my plate clean.Next up, our free dessert. Delicious homemade ice cream packed between two delectable cookies I opted for vanilla with chocolate chip and Jade for strawberry with ginger snap. Both were drool worthy and we finished them up loving every bite.Now, since I had been really excited to go to this place, my boyfriend wanted me to bring him a treat to try. Meatball sammie he asked for so when our dessert came our waitress put in my order for a meatball smash with provolone for my man. This time our order was ready quickly and she neatly placed the bag on the back of my chair to take when we left. An FYI, if you want to do takeout too, they don't do sliders. Everything else is fair game. Now for my signature part of the review, the bathroom. Hidden behind a thick dark wooden door with just a simple rooster plate on the front, the bathroom is actually really nice. Decorated with an old time summer countryside feel the bathroom smells fresh. Accessorized with a large wooden table, large pedestal sink and a Toto toiled (info courtesy of Jade N.)

Hero? Smash? Salad? Naked Balls?), and what kind of sauce you'd like to lick off your balls. LOVE the lamb balls they frequently have as a special, probably my favorite. After that, the spicy pork is where it's at (especially with the meat, mushroom or parmesan cream sauces).The balls will be served to you piping hot and very quickly after you order. You will probably want more balls. Or you can restrain yourself and create your own Ice Cream Sandwiches out of a variety of freshly baked cookies and ice cream flavors.

Also had a side house salad and mint lemonade. To me the meatballs had little taste and the sauce was bland. There was no \"oomph\" in this plate or anything that made it stand out. Sure, it has a nice presentation in the bowl topped with a thin bread slice, but I did not experience the flavor explosion that so many here have raved about. Plus, the portion is on the small side.The salad was covered in a guacamole type dressing and also had kernels of corn in it. The greens were fresh and crispy, but were overpowered by an overabundance of dressing poured all over it. The dressing was tasty, and had chunks of guacamole in it, but it was too much overkill. The mint lemonade was a nice cool refreshing drink on a humid day. Cost for all this came out to $14 before tax and tip, so it is not too pricey. Again, I just feel that this place is a bit over hyped. It's not bad, but definitely not all that fantastic either. Maybe I have to come back here again and try something else. I don't know. Maybe I am just one of the lucky ones who know what fantastic meatballs should taste like since I grew up eating them. 3.5 stars is what I would give this place if I could.", "Date": "2011-07-30", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Kevin L.", "ReviewID": "dmx0owHw5pxlPqA1KZcTPw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "How is it that one food item could possibly be so compelling to warrant the hour-long waits some eager diners are willing to endure for a seat at a table?

These three words come to mind as I think of The Meatball Shop. That, even on a cold wintry, late night in December, you will witness throngs of people trying to get in - not leave this place - just for a taste of their delectable balls. (Ha, get your head out of the gutter, you naughty little boy/girl!) The wait time was 1 hour and 15 minutes for us, but with all the recent hysteria surrounding this place, we figured dinner at 10pm wouldn't be that much of a hassle. That said, it proved to be worth the wait. My overall opinion was that I really enjoyed this place for it's atmosphere, service and novelty menu. Our generation is all about customization, and being able to choose the meat (vegetarians fret not b/c they have herbivorous \"meat\"-balls for you as well!), the accompanying sauce and sides, hits all the right notes. On this front, very well played Meatball shop proprietors; you guys have tapped into the weaknesses of the \"me\"-generation and have done a tremendous thing playing into our hands. The food here is solid. We had the classic beef meatballs with the spicy sauce, as well as two small, spicy pork sliders with pesto, a chicken hero on brioche with the Parmesan sauce, and a side of sauteed broccoli. Wait, I didn't even get to the dessert yet. So all this food felt like a great big splurge because it sure felt as though we feasted like kings (and the fact that the bill was well under $50 was surprising). My favorite was the pork sliders. The meat was juicy and succulent, and the nice balance between the spiciness of the pork along with the sweet and tangyness of the pesto was marvelous. The sides may not get too much play here in the reviews, so I have to profess my love for the sauteed broccoli. It was tender and fresh, not overcooked or rubbery, and nicely flavored. Not to mention also, that these lil green stubs made me feel a tiny bit better about eating so much meat! Double hooray for the broccoli! Lastly, as stuffed as we were, what would a special occasion be without some dessert?! Thus, we had the brownie cookie and mint ice cream sandwich. The cookie appeared to have been too hard, maybe not fresh at first, but actually it was fantastic and paired very nicely with the homemade mint ice cream. This was stellar. I am certainly on board the Meatball Shop train, but I have to say there is a place in Brooklyn with meatballs that I think surpass anything I have eaten here. I am from Queens, and am unable to do anything else but keep it real, sorry, don't be outraged. But, in all honesty, there are raisins and pine nuts in Frankie 457's Meatballs and they are ridiculously phenomenal (5 stars phenomenal!!). Take a trip to Carroll Gardens and see for yourself. One small gripe. You know what would really be fantastic though, Meatball Shop? Markers that actually work. I get that they are worn out by constant usage, but it reminds me of my underfunded public elementary school when teachers never had enough chalk for their boards.

I'd pass on it in lieu of some greens next time.To round out the meal, my dining partner and I split an ice cream sandwich - you select what kind of cookie and ice cream you want to mix. We went with one of the more popular options of a brownie cookie and mint ice cream. Yum! The mint ice cream alone was a little reminiscent of toothpaste, but paired with the soft brownie cookie, it was the perfect ending to a fun dinner.I should mention that you're supposed to mark off the menu with the pens on the table. Mine simply refused to work. I swear it had nothing to do with the alcohol I had just downed before getting there. I swear!!!!

If you come any time other than a weekday lunch be prepared to wait at least a half hour.This place has great balls, especially the naked ones. I love how they taste in my mouth. But seriously, they're moist, flavorful and have both the right size and density (m to the / to the V). However, at the end of the day a meatball is a meatball. I've had some bad meatballs in my day - even outside of the Jersey Shore - but usually they turn out good, even without a lot of effort (ground meat + bread + eggs + spice = win). Meatball Shop's are better than the norm but not super-awesomely better - I'd give them 3.5 stars. The sauces are also tasty. I tried the classic tomato and parmesan cream, both of which were rich and possessed a chord or two of complexity that elevated them above your standard red/white sauce fare.At this point I was wavering between giving Meatball Shop 3 or 4 stars, but the sides really brought the experience down. I had the risotto of the day, chanterelle and prosciutto, and the market salad, saut\u00e9ed escarole with raisins and a couple other items. The risotto was creamy, but the flavor was lacking - it tasted like it needed more chicken stock and I couldn't detect the prosciutto. The salad was likewise limp and not that good - the escarole was too bitter.From reading the other reviews it sounds like I should come back, get the balls in a sandwich and follow that up with an ice cream sandwich. I'd be down with that.This is just me thinking aloud, but how well would this work with pasta, like spaghetti with meatballs? I almost feel like it would be meatballs with spaghetti. Not good or bad, just thinking about it is all.+1 to Meatball Shop for sharing its secrets.

Even the lemonade was great - and maybe I'm only saying this cause the bartender was sweet enough to make us lemonade bellinis, which weren't on the menu, but were a special treat cause we kind of wanted one. \u00a0The decor here is super cute and it's a really affordable fun and delicious lunch or dinner. \u00a0You probably don't need to hear me say any of this though since The Meatball Shop is so \"HOT ON YELP\" right now. \u00a0I figured I'd through in a penny into our community pool of thoughts. \u00a0Enjoy!", "Date": "2010-07-09", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Lawrence C.", "ReviewID": "z6Csrv1qdg9iSfn_5v0TAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had some lucky food convives. The girl who accompanied me to Zenkichi, Megu, and the New Amsterdam Market is one. Doing her better is someone I've taken to places as far and wide as Pulino's, Barney Greengrass, and 15 East.But I think everyone else is trumped by the lady who's been with me to Balthazar, DBGB, and friggin' Momofuku Ko. For our next act, I wanted to shift a bit downscale, and when plan A (Lucali) decided to go and have an electrical failure that night, we had to trudge back onto the F train and settle for something on the LES instead. What place could do in a pinch, could follow up the likes of Keith McNally, Daniel Boulud, David Chang...?Would you believe a restaurant from Daniel Holzman?Well, that's the current culinary zeitgeist: take a chef who's worked in Le Bernadin and San Francisco's highly-regarded SPQR. Let him move into a tiny space on the LES. Make it loud, and light it with energy-wasting dim bulbs. Then find an appropriately homey foodstuff -- make sure it appeals to the drunken crowd -- gussy it up with snazzily-sourced ingredients, devote the menu monomaniacally to said foodstuff... Voila! The Meatball Shop is born.It's a fun spot, to be sure. Doing bustling business, it is loud indeed. Did I miss the memo to remain in recession mode? Because dinner here is cheap enough to have made it onto Time Out NY's list of, well, cheap restaurants for dates. I wasn't with a date; personally, I think the place is just too deafening for romancing.But okay, okay, you don't care about any of that stuff. You just want to know about the meatballs. Well, they come via a slew of delivery vehicles, of which I chose the slider route for maximal variety. Choose any meatball meat, choose any sauce, $3 a pop. For the portion size (each meatball is about the size of a golf ball), it's not as crazy cheap as I'd been led to believe, but certainly not unreasonable.I got the beef in tomato sauce, the spicy pork in spicy meat sauce, and the chicken in parmesan cream sauce. Improbably, the chicken was the best of the bunch, succulent and winningly seasoned. The spicy pork wasn't too spicy-hot, but it hid a surprising amount of juice under its bumpy exterior. The beef was a little lackluster on its own, but I imagine it would have been perfect tossed with some spaghetti (also an option). Each meatball was loosely packed, just the way I like my, uh, balls.Though I did not taste it, my convive's meatball hero, all baguetted and with cheese melted sexily on top, also looked appealing. We shared a roasted beet salad, which was good, but who are we kidding, when was the last time you saw someone really mess up roasted beets?But it was the meal's finisher, ice cream sandwiches, that delivered the knockout punch for me. There are a lot of options, but simplicity usually wins for me where ice cream in concerned: I got a generous scoop of vanilla sandwiched in between two \"peanut butter cookies\". They really turned out to be more like frozen discs of peanut butter cookie dough -- a messy but brilliant flourish, since they decay along with the ice cream, melting and melding their essence with the creamy vanilla. A perfect dessert for a casual joint like the Meatball Shop.So what could've seemed like a pretty gimmicky place a la K! Pizzacone actually ended up being much closer to Rice to Riches in its pure execution of a simple concept. And it clearly has Rice to Riches-caliber staying power.

How sad is that? Well the time has come to share my expertise on this place. This wonderful and delicious place that I can't help craving. I found this place on yelp of course. It was one of the top hot yelp picks or whatever it's called. It wasn't at the top of my list to try, but since Clinton St. Baking Co had an hour plus wait, me and my boyfriend decided to try meatballs for lunch instead of pancakes. It was the best choice we ever made.The first time we came here, it was packed. I think it was around 1pm or so and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. There isn't anywhere to wait inside so we sat outside and waited. No one was seated outside because it was freezing. Once we were seated, it was a little cramped. The back of my chair was touching the back of someone's chair. But it was okay. The restaurant was a decent size and also had a bar filled with so many types of wines. Anyway, we were greeted by our waitress right away and was brought iced water. She asked if we ever came there to eat and we said no. So she explained to else everything on the menu and recommended some of her favorites. We have our own markers and we mark what we want on the menu and she takes it for our orders. It's pretty cool. So there are the naked balls which are 4 meatballs with a sauce. You can choose from spicy pork, beef classic, chicken, veggie, salmon? I believe and also the special ball of the day. Usually it changes daily. And then you choose a sauce: mushroom gravy, spicy meat, classic tomato, Parmesan cream or pesto. That is $7. You can also choose a side dish which is an extra $4 and you can choose to have it under your naked balls or on the side. My boyfriend got the spicy pork with the spicy meat sauce over spaghetti. I quote \"it is the best spaghetti ever.\" He loved it. I thought it was pretty good as well.Now we move on to the sandwiches. There are the \"heroes\" which comes with 3 meatballs with the same choices above as well as a sauce which are the same above as well. Then you choose between provolone or mozzarella. I recommend the mozzarella, it is absolutely fresh and you can believe that they make it in-house. So good. \u00a0Then you choose a wheat or white baguette. The second time I came here I got the classic beef with pesto, mozzarella on wheat. It was absolute heaven! It comes with a side salad as well. That was good too! The third time I came here I got another hero with the special ball of the day which was bolognese. I got it with spicy meat sauce and mozzarella on wheat. That was NOT a disappoint. SO good. OMG you have no idea...(hero = $9)The other sandwiches they offer is the \"smash\" which is two meatballs with a sauce and cheese. It's on a regular burger bun. It was my least favorite. The bun became soggy and it was hard to eat. I ended up having it dissect it and eat with a fork. I tried the smash with classic beef balls with mushroom gravy and mozzarella. The mushroom gravy was FANTASTIC. One of my favorite sauces. The \"smash\" is 8 dollars and it comes with a side which you could substitute with another if you do not prefer salad. i got the mashed potatoes and it was really buttery. Too buttery for me. I would pass on trying that as a side.Lastly, the other items on the menu I never tried. The sliders. One meatball, one sauce. Best way to try all the meatballs. Three dollars each. Then there is the 8 dollar \"salad\" that comes with 3? 4? meatballs atop a salad. That seems pretty good. I would have to try that next time when I'm not tempted to get the hero, which would be really hard. For dessert, me and my boyfriend tried the ice cream cookie sandwich. It was raved all over yelp so we HAD to try it. I didn't see what the big whoop was about. It wasn't good. I mean, it tasted fine, but it was hard to eat and the cookies were really hard. The ice cream was fantastic though. Homemade and delicious. I tried vanilla and their special for that day, cinnamon. It is worth it to get a side of ice cream for two dollars if you have room for dessert.In the end, this place is really awesome. I'm a regular and I discovered this place less than a month ago. Me and my boyfriend came back two days later after trying this place for the first time. The second time around my boyfriend on classic beef with mushroom gravy over rigatoni. It was really good. I love this place. It is literally a New York MUST. It's located on the lower east side which sucks to get to, but it's not that bad compared to Clinton St. Baking Co. Anyway, ENJOY!

A challenge.And so it begins. The small meatballs and the ice cream that was just ok along with the dusty wine bottles at the bottom of the bar put this place low on my scale.Trust me, I've been Italian for over 45 years now. I know good Italian, red and white checkered table cloths, red sauce and meatballs in some good restaurants.

This meatball shop, The Meatball Shop, contained the cure to my wrinkle-filled blues. What better way to re-discover one's inner child then with menus that you actually write on with magic marker? What fun!We didn't have any wait at this time, which I understand is rare for this place, so I recommend for parties of 2 people: Mondays at 9pm! My friend and I sampled a potpourri of different meatball varieties and sauce pairings: the veggie and the chicken fennel were my personal favorites. The classic beef has pancetta mixed in, this results in curiously chewy bites. The spicy pork was a bit dry. And the special for the day was a take on buffalo chicken wings. The main issue with doing this flavor in meatball form is that it inherently lacks the crunchy fried chicken outside - a major part of the pleasure of fried chicken. In terms of the sauces I sampled: the pesto was my favorite. So green, so fresh, so fragrant. They were pretty skimpy on the classic tomato and I wish this wasn't the case, because that might have been good too. I just can't tell! Maybe ask for extra sauce (If you like things a bit saucy like I do...) The same can actually be said for all of the sauces I sampled: Just not enough! Dessert really takes the cake though! They give you huge and I mean HUGE balls of iced cream. PLUS you can design your own iced cream sandwiches - I've basically forgotten how old I am at this point. We did chocolate chip + mint + brownie and gingersnap + caramel + snicker-doodle. Both were amazing, the mint was better.

Communal seating, low lighting, and a rambunctious crowd is great for an easy night out with friends.

Several friends have raved about this place and now I see why. It's a cute little place in the LES. The space is small and very tight. They have about 5 tables for 2 and one long table where they seat larger groups and some couples. At this long table, you are literally elbow to elbow with the person next to you. They also had a few tables outside, but even those are cramped. As you're opening the door to go inside, you can't even open it all the way otherwise you'll hit the back of the chair of someone at those tables outdoors. Despite the tight space, the staff is very friendly and helpful, the music is awesome - Doo Wop era I believe, and food is delicious!My bf & I came here on an early Sunday afternoon and we were told that it would be a 20-25 min wait, but we had a table ready in about 10. They even took my number so we didn't have to wait there, which I love, because who wants to be tied to a place while they're waiting. Once seated, we got our menus and noticed the markers on the table. You mark down what you want on the plastic menus. Since it was our first time, there was a lot of marking and erasing. Luckily a waitress came over to explain the menu before we wasted any more ink. She was friendly and helpful. With any of the sandwiches or meals, you're unable to mix and match meatballs so we both decided to order their Sliders ($3 each) so we would be able to try a few of the different meatballs. There are 5 Meatballs to choose from: 1.) Classic Beef (All Natural Beef ground w/ Prosciutto, Herbs, & Fresh Ricotta)2.) Spicy Pork (Pork Shoulder & Hot Pickled Cherry Peppers)3.) Chicken (Chicken Thighs, White Wine, Black Pepper, Fennel Seed, & Herbs)4.) Vegetable (Mustrooms & Green Lentils)5.) Special - Reuben Ball (Corned Beef, Swiss Cheese, Saurkraut w/ Thousand Island Dressing)Along with your Meatballs, you also have 5 Sauces to choose from:1.) Classic Tomato2.) Spicy Meat Sauce (Pork braised w/ Chiles & Tomatoes)3.) Mushroom Gravy (Mushrooms & Onions stewed w/ Chicken Stock)4.) Parmesan Cream (similar to Alfredo sauce)5.) Pesto (Spinach, Basil, Walnut, Olive Oil, & Parmesan Cheese)I had the 1.) Classic Beef w/ Classic Tomato, 2.) Chicken w/Mushroom Gravy, and 3.) Special (Reuben) which didn't require any additional sauce since it already had the Thousand Island Dressing. My bf had the same except for the fact that he got the Spicy Pork instead of the Chicken. The sliders arrived and they looked so cute all lined up on our platters. The tiny buns were warm and toasted while the meatballs were juicy and delicious.

The bread took away flavor from both the sauce and the meatballs. The greenmarket vegetables that I've had at the Meatball Shop have been superior--particularly, the brussel sprouts with toasted nuts.

The intimate setting, unpretentious, laid back decor, loud 80's/alternative/indie background music gives off a cool vibe that makes dining here feel hip. Even ordering food is pretty cool. For first timers, the server or bartender effortlessly explains the entire menu in a matter of a minute! Customers use an erasable sharpie to select their orders from a laminated menu and then voila!-- it's reused again for later customers. What's great about this place is that the menu accommodates anyone's taste including vegans and those who wish to dine with an alcoholic beverage. Options for beverages include single serving, carafe or bottle/pitcher sizes for wine and sangria. Dizzy from the extensive selection, I got the meatball burger with brioche bread. My meatball (traditional beef) was tasty but thought my brioche bread could have been more crispy--twas more on the soggy side. The biggest surprise was the dessert. My friend and I loved the ice cream sandwich. Not only is it inexpensive ($4.50) but you have your choice of the ice cream (mint chocolate, chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, etc.) and even better, the two layers of cookies- you can get the cookie in the same flavor or different flavor (e.g., brownie and chocolate chip vs. peanut butter only)! All in all, we had a fun dining experience. I would give this place five stars if they have HH specials but that won't stop me from coming back here again and again.

One person took care of drinks, someone else noticed that I might need a little once-over on how the menu/ordering works (it's a little off the beaten path but very cool) and he came over and explained it and was full of suggestions, another guy was on top of table maintenance like it was...well...his job.

You'll definitely find something good and suitable by the glass, carafe or bottle and the prices are shockingly good. The food was 9 out of 10. There's a ton of cream and pork. There's pork in all their meatballs and it's not specified anywhere. I had a meatball sandwich with spicy sauce and parm sauce on the side for dipping as suggested by the very friendly guy who helped me get into their shtick. The parm sauce was goddam amazing but the spicy sauce wasn't spicy and it had that stewed tomato flavor that happens when you overcook them. The sandwich was served with an arugula and apple salad that was just freakin incredible. Some of the freshest arugula I've had. Like it was picked that day. The polenta is creamy and dusted with extremely fine-shaved parmesian.

Back story: Me and my good friend Di tried to go to this place about a month earlier on a random Wednesday night, only to be confronted with a 2 hour wait. Seeing as I had run 4 miles before (STUPID IDEA--Do not come here hungry as frack because you are assured an hour wait even in a blizzard or deluge), I could not wait to eat and we just grubbed in the east village instead. However, due to the hype, we decided that we had to try the Meatball Shop one more time. This time we came on a cold Monday. Fortunately for us, there was on a 45 minute wait. The only crappy thing is that the front of the resto is Calista Flockhart tiny so there was no place to 'wait' per se. We were hit left and right by purses and elbows. If you are remotely claustrophobic, you would have a full on seizure here. Finally our names were called for 2 seats at the bar. Although we preferred to catch up proper in a real seat, both of us were too hungry to care. Diana, not a glutard, got a meatball hero featuring regular beef and mushroom cream sauce. I elected for the balls over fresh vegetables platter (the healthiest way to eat balls, heh). I was feeling adventurous and went for the special 'ball' of the day-- lamb and mint. I also got mushroom cream sauce. 30 minutes later and many 6 dollar glasses of Montpulciano later... THE FOOD WAS AWESOME!!! For 10 dollars, I got: 3 HUGE BALLS (like elephantitis sized here) over an array of fresh veggies including: asparagus, cabbage, green beans, kale, and beets (which I really hate, but I was able to push them aside). Diana got a HUUUGE sandwich. We shared balls (we usually share more than that, ooh la la) and both decided that hers were slightly better. The mushroom cream sauce in both of our balls was FABU.

What you are gonna get are meatballs, not gourmet meatballs, not fall-off-your-chair life-changing better-than-your-grandma meatballs. They are just balls of meat of your choice. I personally didn't like these meatballs that I had. We ordered the classic beef with mushroom gravy over spaghetti and spicy pork with classic tomato sauce and all I can say is that it tasted like airplane food to me, especially the dish with the classic tomato sauce. It tasted like a pasta dish that you'd get on a long-haul international flight and I couldn't shake the thought off throughout the whole meal. (Maybe this is my mind telling me that I should go on vacation?)Dissecting the meatball, I'd say that it tasted as if there was too much filler and not enough meat. Even though the meatballs held together well, the texture was moosh which made me come to the conclusion that they use a lot of soaked fresh breadcrumbs mixed into their meatballs (I don't know this for a fact). The mushroom gravy tasted like it came out of a can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup. If this place is meant to fill some kind of yearning to relive childhood memories, perhaps the Campbell's Cream of Mushroom taste is a good thing. Otherwise, never order the mushroom gravy. It was a fail on my part for ordering it.Surprisingly, the highlights of the meal were not the meatballs but the sides. We ordered the market salad of the day and and also the roasted vegetables which were a relief to my palate as I was forcing myself to finish my meatballs.We ended the meal with the ice-cream sandwiches. Like the meatballs, they are a nostalgic gimmick. They are too sweet for my taste. I'm not sure if I already had a sore throat brewing that night but immediately right after I ate mine, my throat was burning from the extreme sweetness of the ice-cream sandwich.I know my review doesn't really sound like a four star review but if you are really craving meatballs, I think that the meatball shop is a good spot for you.

We had to wait about a half hour so we ordered a bottle of wine, and found a small corner to drink it in (there isn't much room to stand while waiting for a table, brief con). The wait was worth it.

We waited a bit but it was worth it. The beef meatballs in spicy meat sauce (see above - I like meat) were amazing. The sauce was perfect.

We ended our meal with home-made ice cream sandwiches. A plus, you can pick two different cookies! I picked a brownie cookie and a chocolate chip cookie (the chocolate chip was better in my opinion) and the caramel ice cream. At first I was worried the caramel ice cream would make the whole concoction too sweet, but it was fantastic! If you are a fan of caramel at all you must get it!

I had seen \"The Meatball Shop\" listed in \"What's Hot,\" but had never given much thought into actually trying it out.

Thankfully, there was a take out window, which was situated right next to the kitchen. Although quite busy, I was surprised at how great the service was. We were those people who not only had trouble deciding what to order, but also impeded the wait staff from carrying out their duties. Despite this, the menu was explained to use politely and our orders taken patiently.The kitchen can be easily viewed from the take out window. The spectacle was impressive. The speed at which orders were taken and prepared, as well as the quality of preparation, would elicit a silent head nod from the sternest of folk.The food itself was of high quality.

I was dying to ask our waitress \"what if we don't have any balls?\" but I wasn't ballsy enough to ask and didn't want to embarrass my friends who had, without a doubt, cleaner minds than I did :)Okay, I got that out of my system. Time for my review.We waited around 20 minutes for a table outside, which I didn't mind since we weren't the only ones loitering on the sidewalk, and the Meatball Shop was predictably packed. Once we were seated, our waitress passed the menus, which were laminated in order for us to mark our selections right on them. Markers were provided at the table. Extra points for creativity! I ordered the Smash, which is two balls smashed (eek!) on a toasted bun with sauce, cheese, and a side salad. I chose spicy pork balls, mushroom sauce, and provolone cheese, and that was the winning combination for me. The spicy pork balls, well, I don't know if I would call them spicy, they had a bit of a kick to them, but not enough for me to down my glass of water. However, they were delicious with the provolone cheese, but where's the sauce? The smash had just enough to be flavorful, but I love my meatballs drowned in sauce so it was slightly disappointing, but only slightly. The salad was crisp and delish with another winning combo: apple and arugula.Even though the balls were the stars of the show, it was actually the ice cream sandwich that upstaged them and blew me away. I ordered the special of the day, brown sugar ice cream, after my friend asked for a little to taste and raved about it with a look of pure ecstasy on her face... so I got that sandwiched between a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie cookie. Then it was my turn to have a look of pure ecstasy on my face. One thing that irked me: as we started eating our desserts, the waitress thanked us and placed the check on the table. I know that it's crowded and people are waiting for tables but there's something called good manners- and I ain't rushing for no one!Thank you, The Meatball Shop, for some damn good balls :P and damn good ice cream.", "Date": "2012-08-12", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Jonathan C.", "ReviewID": "1QawnkADDK-fB_V2pFjYtQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Preface/background: I am now more focused on quality and am always looking for a great deal (read: value).

I contemplated ordering the spicy pork balls along with the spicy meat sauce but later decided that was too much spicy and I really wanted to get a taste of how the food is here before I go all out with spicy.The classic beef balls were juicy, I can't wait to go back to try some other balls. The spicy meat sauce was just the right amount of spicy. It wasn't too spicy that you can't tste other flavors and mixed well with the balls and risotto. The risotto I had was under the balls, so it had soaked in some of the sauce and that gave it a new level of flavor. it was cooked just right and the perfect compliment to the balls. The piece of focaccia \u00a0bread that came with the balls was totally soaked in sauce by the time I had walked my meal home.

I didn't read all the reviews before I went which I should have, but I agree with what a few yelpers have said. The spicy is NOT spicy, very disappointing.

The waitress was very helpful in explaining the various specials that were available for the week, and the menu itself is very easy to order on - just grab a marker and circle what you want!In the end, we ended up going with two platters of meatballs (4 large meatballs for $7 is a deal that is hard to beat), along with a platter of grilled vegetables as an appetizer. I'm partial to meatballs to begin with, but these were simply divine. We got the special meatballs (lamb with walnuts and mint) in the basil pesto sauce, which was delectable. I'd never had nuts in a meatball before, much less mint, and the pairing worked really well with the sauce as well. In addition, we got the classic beef meatballs in mushroom gravy. Wow. Very standard meat, but the gravy was intensely savory and worked really, really well as a complement to the beef. The vegetable platter was a nice light appetizer that worked well alongside the heaviness of the main dishes.The entire meal, post-tax and pre-tip, came in under $20 was phenomenal. I don't know if there's a better value proposition for a lunchtime meal, but you can't beat the price for the quality of the meatballs here.

TimeOut NY's 100 Best Foods to Eat in NY2. 400+ reviews on Yelp with an aggregate score of 4 stars3. My friend wanting to eat this TWICE in 24 hours.I think that it was certain I NEEDED to know what was so great about the meatballs at the Meatball Shop. Fortunately, it wasn't just the meatballs that really got this place to 5 stars, it was the decor, service and other offerings on the menu.First, I'll start off with the namesake dish, the meatballs. My friends and I shared three different types: spicy pork, beef and chicken and all with different sauces: spicy meat, pesto and parmesan. We got them prepared naked, which means in a bowl topped with cheese shavings. There's really no way to describe a quality meatball. You just know when you bite into heaven. One bite into the spicy pork and you can taste the complexity within each carefully crafted ball. The sauce is what takes the dish to another level. Each sauce has its own unique characteristic that just makes you want to lick the bowl clean and you pretty much can with the side of focaccia that comes with every dish.Next is the decor. Quaint little restaurant that reminds me of Italy for some reason (even though I've never been there).The kitchen is pretty much open and the lion's share of the dining floor is occupied by a cafeteria like bench. Fortunately, this is one of the places that actually works with a cafeteria bench. Everyone is laughing and talking like a family at a reasonable noise level. The cafeteria bench is surrounded by individual two-person tables and a bar, which was complete occupied. What I liked most about the whole presentation was the details down to the silverware, which was literally silver-ware.Then the service is impeccable. While waiting for a third friend, the bartender served us water, even though we were just standing to the side. The hostess is very accommodating; even though our third friend wasn't here and we couldn't be seated, she directed newer patrons to other tables and sat them outside of our reserved square in the middle of the cafeteria bench. Of course if the restaurant reached full capacity, we would expect her to seat customers where ever there was space, but in this case, she kept us in mind as we waited for our tardy friend. Lastly, the wait staff was fast and eager to weigh in with their opinion, which is always a plus at a new restaurant.Finally, we have the other offerings. We paired our meatballs with roasted veggies (brussel sprouts with sugar-coasted walnuts in this case), rigatoni and risotto. The veggies were a good break from all the meat we were consuming and the rigatoni (al dente) was a nice pasta to pair with the main course. What was the star of the night was the risotto, which was rich and creamy and overall probably the best side we had. I would highly recommend the risotto on the side, but not 'under' as its cooked with a parmesan sauce.We ended our night with three different ice cream sandwiches, which was all heavenly. The had a mix of brownie, coconut macaroon and ginger snap cookies with vanilla and mint ice cream. Great portions with soft cookies, except the coconut macaroon. The flavor in everything was incredible strong, which is expected from a Italian restaurant. The mint ice cream felt like I was drinking the bottom of a mojito. The Coconut macaroon was laced with coconut shavings and the ginger snap had a heavy dosage of ginger. All in all, expect each ingredient to be fully recognizable in the final dish.All in all, this is a great place and well worth the money, which isn't even that much. A quick glance at the wine list and no bottle goes for more than $60. I would highly recommend this for a date as its an unrivaled experience in NY.

So you walk into this cool mid-size Lower East Side establishment thats a mix of trendy and vintage. It's not like crate and barrell or restoration hardware in its looks because it feels like someone actually loves and lives in this environment versus a product of a catalog or some trendy hipster. This care is a resounding and consistent theme for the entirety of my experience... as you will see.The truly vintage tables and chairs are close enough to encourage conversation and community but not so close that the you'll be tasting the elbow sweat of the person next to you. they're also old, but not ragged or haphazard... you're comfortable in a chair without a cushion... which is pretty fraking hard to do.I was especially impressed with the menu for multiple reasons. not only a visual feast of fonts and creative typography it was also very easy to understand and very playful at times that encouraged funny conversation. For instance buying meatballs alone is called \"naked Balls\" while you can have your side dish served \"under your balls\". It was also SUSTAINABLE with being laminated and using a marker to check off what you want they can be reused literally FOREVER. kudos for thatThe food was... magnificent. I ordered a Chicken Pesto Naked Balls with spinach under and a fried egg on top. the first bite was, quite frankly and embarrassingly, orgasmic. The balls flavor alone literally exploded in my mouth mixed with (but not overpowered by) the pesto coating. i created about 5 combinations of meat, veggie, foccacia, sauce, and egg to the point that my mouth literally was in pure awe of how soft yet firm everything was. the dishes individually could stand on their own but when combined... it was like eating Voltron, perfection. I wanted to kiss the chef but i settled for leaving a healthy tipDessert was a homemade Ice Cream Sandwich... strangely enough I had no idea you could make those from scratch. They use freshly baked in house cookies mixed with freshly made in house ice cream for give you an ending to a meal thats fraking awesome. the Mind ice cream REALLY TASTED LIKE MINT. not overpowering the cookies but, like the dishes design, served as a medium between the cookies.

We got there just before the rush of after-work people and it became a bustling and lively afterwards. The waitress was very helpful and friendly. Great service.I had the classic beef naked balls with tomato sauce. They tasted fresh and delicious. I underestimated the size of the meatballs, thinking that 4 wouldn't be enough as my dinner. But it was actually just right. I had an order of mashed potatoes which were also great. They were creamy , buttery and captured the fluffiness and light taste of mashed potatoes that I like. Overall the whole meal was very well worth the price. I left there full but not the \"I feel fat and disgusting\" type of full.

It's homey, it has a friendly bar, and the staff seem so down to earth. I was nervous about communal seating, but it wasn't packed so we didn't have to worry about other diners. It does get packed later into the day, so expect to wait if you're coming for dinner.The menu design is unique - it's laid out at the table before you even come in, and you take a dry erase marker to check off what you want: the type of meatball, what kind of sandwich, if you even want a sandwich, (they have heroes, focaccia, and sliders) , etc. I ordered a hero with pork meatballs with spicy meat sauce and mozzarella cheese. Must say, pretty amazing. It comes with an arugula salad tossed in a light vinaigrette dressing and sliced apples. But I digress. The meatball sub, which is what it was essentially, was juicy and full of meat. However, I expected more flavor from the meatballs; maybe the spicy meat sauce, which wasn't spicy at all, smothered the taste of the pork. The meat sauce was basically a tomato sauce possibly mixed with dried chili that added no heat whatsoever.I love arugula, so the salad could not go wrong. The thinly sliced apples added a subtle sweetness to it which lessened the bitter greenness of the arugula. Interesting combination; SUKMON LIKES.Lastly, we each tried an ice cream cookie sandwich. You pick the cookie and the type of ice cream. I had the chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream - typical I know, but classics never die out. The chocolate chip cookie was not your usual CCC though. The chips were chipped into smaller pieces so they were dispersed throughout the entire cookie. Bits of chocolate in every bite.

I also got to try the other dishes and everything was excellent. The risotto was fantastic was well, not overcooked, not too creamy, just right. Personal preference: order the side as a side, because you can order the side and have it be placed beneath the meatball, but I'm not a fan of mixing flavors. Ordering a side as a side dish allows you to taste the meatballs in its original flavor and the side by itself.For dessert, we ordered and shared two ice cream sandwiches. 1) brownie and banana chocolate walnut cookie with espresso ice cream 2) brownie and chocolate chip ice cream with brown sugar ice cream. My favorite ice cream had to be the espresso, which tasted like coffee but not too strong. The brownie cookies along with the espresso ice cream made an excellent pairing. The brown sugar ice cream was good too, but the chocolate chip cookie was too hard and crunchy for my preference.. soft and chewy is the way to go.

I had to try a few sliders; Classic Beef ball with mushroom sauce and a Spicy Pork ball with Parmesan sauce. The Spicy Pork was my fav of the two. I had the creamy Polenta as a side.

The veggie meatballs here are a-mazing, and the classic marinara sauce is both meat-free AND delicious [beware: the mushroom gravy is NOT vegetarian...it's made with chicken stock]!You know why I love this place so much?* Because there are so many options. First off, you have the option of type of meatball(s). Then, the type of sauce [or no sauce, if you're into naked balls**]. But, it doesn't stop there. There are practically unlimited ways in which you can order your 'balls. You want your meatballs served on bread? You got it. Over a bed of vegetables? Alright! On top of pasta? Done. FYI, all of the sides are delicious. Get the white beans. They will change your liiiiiife.I'm ALL about options. But having the whole world in the palm of your hands can sometimes turn making a decision into a shitshow. To solve this little conundrum, I usually order the \"Everything but the kitchen sink\" Three balls covered in your choice of sauce, underneath the chef's selection of fresh vegetables and greens. OMG. SO. GOOD.The prices are totally reasonable. I definitely prefer the location in Williamsburg to this location. The food is the same, the beer is the same, and the friendliness of the staff is the same, but there is MUCH more space in Brooklyn. The extra seating is key --- not having to wait for a table is a big plus. The one and only time that I had to wait for a table at the Williamsburg location, my wait wasn't much of a wait at all.The Meatball Shop has since become one of my favorite places to grab a bite in the entire city.

I tasted mint and rose.-Risotto was amazing.-Meatballs are small but good but they should be more \"meaty\".-Endless amount of sauces to dip your balls in!-Best Ice Cream Sandwich EVER...fresh cookies and fresh ice cream...oh so good.-Root Beer Floats!!!", "Date": "2011-01-11", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Ming L.", "ReviewID": "ZZvKFn_rK-ZxS6B5SEIbFA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So they might have something here. \u00a0A Communal table in the middle of a compact dining room. \u00a0An innovative mix and match menu featuring meatballs that are definitely above average. \u00a0Rotating special ingredients in their vegetable of the day, risotto, and other items. \u00a0A visible kitchen filled with hipster looking staff in a hipster looking neighborhood. \u00a0All in all, a good vibe.We went there at 4pm hoping that we'd avoid the rush. \u00a0Based on the number of people waiting at such an odd hour, I'm assuming there is no avoiding...or at least not at the moment. \u00a0We wiggled our way near the bar area and opportunistically pounced on a couple of stools that were being vacated. \u00a0This was a big score, and I would advise this strategy for anyone coming here in the near future. \u00a0I ordered the Spicy Pork meatballs (which were better than the beef, if you ask me), with classic tomato sauce, \"under\" spaghetti. \u00a0\"Under\" just means that meatballs were served over the pasta rather than on the side. \u00a0We ordered the vegetable of the day, which was collard greens and a side of the risotto, which happened to be mushroom. \u00a0The food was delicious but not spectacular. \u00a0But the prices were incredibly low. \u00a0I think it hit the right mix of price, quality, and vibe: \u00a0it was a pleasant meal.In summary, if you want to enjoy tasty balls served by tattooed and pierced hipsters for a reasonable price and you don't mind a wee bit of a wait, then go to Meatball Shop. \u00a0You'll enjoy it.", "Date": "2011-02-02", "Author_Location": "NY, NY"}, {"Author": "Olaf K.", "ReviewID": "3TA6wXm2jU9toSsEKB2afw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great place! \u00a0Heard a little hype about this place and spontaneously decided to go there with a friend for lunch. \u00a0It took us a while to find because we were looking for some hole-in-the wall take-out place (the name kinda gives off that impression). \u00a0Boy were we surprised when we finally found it. \u00a0Fancy. \u00a0Hip.

The sliders were totally satisfying and adorable. Full of flavor. If we'd been a little more hungry, we would have gotten the big portion but for our purposes the portions were perfect. I had a mini-peroni (they do shorty beers on tap for $3, great if you don't want to drink too much or already have been) and BF had 2 PBRs (also $3 each).

So my first time at Meatball was when the LES location opened and I was \"eh\" about it. Recently a friend came into town and said he felt like Italian food, personally I'm not the biggest Italian fan unless its something fried but I decided to take him to Meatball Shop.Friday night, busy, crowded, Bedford, yup you know the deal. We give the hostess our info (table for 2) and she says they will call me on my phone when the table opens up, should be about 20-30 mins. We go to the bar next door and grab a couple drinks. Waiting, chatting and more waiting. We were in the bar for 40 minutes until we closed out our tab and walked back.I over heard the hostess tell someone in front of me that she wasnt sure how much longer it would be but probably around 30 minutes, they got mad and left. I talked to her and she didnt even want to tell me how much longer it would be but offered the front window bar for 2 to me, which we accepted. Five minutes later she comes over and asks if we wanted to eat there so she could get us a waitress, uhhh obviously......Now the good part starts. I ordered the chicken meatballs with parmesan cream sauce over kale risotto.. WOW!.. It was amazing, so amazing that 2 people came up to me that were waiting for a table to ask what I had ordered. Perfectly tender and juicy meatballs paired with the rich cream sauce and cheesy risotto. Damn near perfect and satisfied me without over stuffing.My friend started out with 4 meatball sliders, the one that stood out to me was the special which was a turkey and stuffing meatball, paired with gravy and cranberry sauce.. Again, WOW!... The flavors were wonderful and tasted like my perfect Thanksgiving bite.. He finished the 4 sliders and then ordered 3 more.. He's a growing boy.All in all this second trip insured that I would be eating here more. Only gripe is the service to get seated, seemed like she wasn't trained properly or has not been a hostess for too long, not rude or brash, just didnt know what was going on..

When I asked the server about the disclaimer she said \"Weeeeeeell- they are all cooked in pork. But it's just pork fat.\" Yeah- last time I checked that was called LARD. So if you are ok with your food being \"Just cooked in lard\", then this is the place for you. The server spoke highly of the veggie meatball. I was ready to opt out and leave the place but she swore the veggie was amazing. She lied. I should have known better than to trust a veggie item from an establishment that thinks they can't cook a dish without putting pork in everything. I if expected a Boca or Morning Star quality of meat. The veggie meatball is made from nuts and it tastes just like nuts. As a matter of fact, they don't even grind all the nuts and lentils up. There were hard crunchy lentils and nut chunks in every bite. It was very unpleasant. In addition, it seems that the kitchen didnt even attempt to season the veggie balls. They were so bland and tasteless that after asking for extra sauce to try to get some hint of flavor- I simply knocked them off my sandwich and ate a mozzarella marinera sandwich. It was terrible.We went here on a Wed night. We had 3 people suggest the place and trusted their opinion. There was a 1 hour wait at 8:00 pm. We put our name down and had a drink elsewhere.

It would be better to actually have customers order at the to go counter and then take a seat: CHIPOTLE-style. Then I could save on the totally undeserved tip.

I ordered them served with the marinara sauce, but had to ask for another side of pesto to liven it up. What's cool about this place is the menu and the experience. The menu is a laminated sheet of paper where you check off what you want. What kind of balls do you prefer? Do you want your balls \"naked\" (not in bread), do you want them as a salad? Would you like your balls in a slider? How do you want to top them? The meaty marinara was recommended, but I stuck with regular marinara to keep to my veggie ways. The group of famished guys I went with devoured their first plates in about 30 seconds, and went to order seconds. The dishes run around $8 if I remember correctly, so it doesn't break the bank to order 2. According to them- the pork meatballs with the spicy meat sauce was \"the bomb\", and I'm pretty sure they would have ordered thirds if we weren't itching to move on.End of the meal ice cream sandwiches are definitely worth trying. We had the chocolate brownie with homemade mint ice cream, pretty damn good. One bit of warning with the mint though, it's really.... minty. As in fresh mint plucked from your garden, not the sweet cream mint that most of us are used to eating. It's a \u00a0strong mint, not very sweet at all. It does, however, pair rather well with the chocolate cookie.

They should be The Ice Cream Sandwich Shop... lol lame I know, but I really enjoyed their ice cream sandwich. They used two cookies and a scoop of ice cream in between. I ordered the Walnut Meringue with vanilla and although it was a bit difficult to eat I found my way around it. You can't eat it like a normal ice cream sandwich... at least not mine... my cookies were hard but in a good way. So I broke my cookie into smaller pieces and scooped some ice cream on top of it ... it was YUMMM.", "Date": "2010-07-22", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Moxie L.", "ReviewID": "a-TtlDWlSqYMVIHTutI-9A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This place is so clean and welcoming.Tried the classic beef with classic tomato and the veggie with mushroom gravy.

We were a group of 5 so we had to wait a little while (we were quoted an hour) for seats because the place is on the small side even though it was a Tuesday night. We arrived there around 9:30. We had done some research before so we knew they didn't take reservations.The friendly hostess took our phone number and we waited at Epstein's Bar next door. (terrible name for a bar btw) She kept us informed the whole time and even got us seated 20 minutes earlier than the time she quoted so that was nice.The ambiance is casual and rustic with a long communal table running down the center of the restaurant. We sat at the corner table which seats 6. So the menu is a little confusing/overwhelming if you've never been there before. They are laminated with all kinds of choices for meatballs, sauces,sides and various meatball sandwiches. You're given a dry erase marker to check off what you want. One of the helpful servers suggested ,since we were a larger group, to do the bowls of 4 meatballs for each type of meatball and suggested what sauces went well with what type of meat. There are a lot of different types of sauces like classic marinara, meat, spicy, pesto, creamy parmesan, mushroom, etc.We ordered classic meat with classic sauce, spicy pork with spicy sauce (this was a big hit!),chicken with pesto, veggie with mushroom sauce, and their special meatball that night was bolognese (beef and mortadella) with meat sauce and one with marinara sauce. By the way, the bowls come with a strip of focaccia bread but I had no time or belly space to waste on bread.For sides we ordered the risotto, polenta (sooo creamy and delicious!!), their featured greens--kale, and their grilled veggies for the night--brussell sprouts with pecans which was also fantastic. Everything we had was sumptuous. The balls that went the fastest were the spicy pork, the classic and the special.Now for dessert, their ice cream sandwiches are not to be missed! Same sort of deal with a lot of choices which you can mix and match with ice cream and cookies. We chose to share mint with chocolate cookies, vanilla with choco chip cookies, and the special oatmeal ice cream with one ginger and one oatmeal cookie. The fave was the special.We were sooo stuffed! and after all that food and drink (we had 2 pitchers of Peroni) the bill was only around 100$ for five of us!

Perhaps a red sauce instead of the white cream sauce that I ate it with would've helped.Pasta here is served al dente and I'm sad I didn't get to try the risotto.

I wonder now if it would have been possible to get a little extra on the side for dipping... I had a glass of sangria which was surprisingly tasty (i find sangria is usually hit or miss at restaurants that don't really specialize in making the beverage, but it was delightful here).

You would think the sides would be an afterthought- and although I only tried mine - it was insanely good - roasted fennel with raisins and cashews - texturally right-on, and the sweetness of the fennel was akin to a caramelized onion.Smooshie sandwiches are also on the menu- smooshed on a brioche bun with cheese and with a side of arugula.

This review is primarily for the 2nd time I went there! Boyfriend and I were famished as we were exploring and walking around on a be-a-utiful June day int he Lower East Side... it was perfect weather, clearly, for a meatball shop meal. We waited for about an hour or so (went and got a beer at a nearby bar and watched Miami crush the Celtics, le sad!), and then had a small table given to us near the WC, so we were happy with the location.The special ball that night was Steak, Cheddar, and Bacon balls, which were MARVELOUS. They were paired really well with the mushroom sauce that my man also got, along with the delicious risotto of the night. If Meatball Shop does ANYTHING well, it's their risotto - I can't remember the flavor of this week's, but it was creamy, silken, and cooked just enough to be tender and not starchy like some risotto can be. It was, and I will stand by this throwback phrase for forever, da bomb diggity. However, I had the chicken balls in a parmesan cream sauce.... and it left a lot to be desired in taste and in texture. The balls were way dry (heh. heh.), and the sauce just could NOT get it to work for the balls - it made it a little creamy, but dry on the outside. Weird combo man. I had also the grilled carrots with walnuts, cardammon and raisens, and that was good! The wine wasn't all that great, it was too dry for my taste (I hate dry rose's), and it made us more thirsty than anything.

I heard amazing things about their meatballs and icecream sandwiches, but what the jack...it was NOT good. It's so unfortunate because I was looking foward to this experience so much. I ordered the beef meatballs with pesto sauce and my goodness was it salty! I actually really like salty things and always salt my food when I can. The pesto sauce I got with it didnt' help either, because it was beyond sodium overload! My friend had the beef meatballs as well in the classic tomato sauce. Hers were not as salty because of the different sauce, but the meatballs were still just as salty as mine. I had to try the ice cream sandwich, so we got the vanilla icecream sandwiched between a chocolate chip cookie and a snickdoodle cookie. I am so dissappointed because if I'm going to potentially get fat off something, it better be worth it! The cookies were as hard as a rock. The table next to me couldn't even break their cookies either. You would think the cookie would be soft and chewy! There was no way of breaking the cookie except for removing it off the ice cream (defeating the whole point of having a icecream sandwich) and breaking it in half with your hands because a fork and knife were useless in this case. As for the ice cream, it was just okay. The texture and taste was very similar to Breyer's vanilla ice cream. The only good thing about this place was the decent friendly service we experienced.

The fact is, I've visited both the Brooklyn & Manhattan locations several times since they opened and the food has always been really good. But unfortunately, the last experience I had there, will be the last experience I ever have at The Meatball Shop. I'm usually more forgiving, unlike my girlfriend who does many things well, but nothing better than holding a grudge. I've decided I'll hold this grudge. I reached out to the owner and GM about the issue on Facebook. He saw the kindly worded letter I wrote him on Jan 22nd \u00a0and then just ignored it. Here's what happened:I had some friends in town at the end of December and decided to take them to one of my favorite spots, The Meatball Shop, before we went to see a film. The place was nearly filled but there was no line and I was happy to be seated quickly. We usually have to wait 30-60 minutes. There were two open 2-tops - the last two in a grouping of three 2-tops in the corner. . Since there were three of us, I assumed they were going to push the two 2-tops together. No, they decided they would push the middle two top over to the left, nearly connecting with the third occupied two top and have one of us sitting in the middle. We were fine with that at first until we realized that it was not possible for the 3 of us to put our legs under the table at the same time. One of us would have to sit side saddle in our chair for the entire meal. Then we also realized that once the meals came out, it would be impossible for them to fit on the table together. I decided the best thing to do would be to talk to the server about the possibility of pushing the two tops together. After all, a few minutes had passed and it was still not occupied. I walked up to the front of the restaurant, a woman, who identified herself as the general manager, approached me and I told her that the table was not working for us. I asked if she would push the two 2-tops together for the three of us. She said, \"We don't do that. If I did then other people coming in would have to wait for a table.\"I explained to her that, either way, someone has to wait; We will have to wait for three random spots at the communal table or the next people to walk in would have to wait and in all honestly, that between me and my friends boyfriend, we'd make up that 4th cover with no problem. I then added, that it is totally fine if you want us to wait for a 3-top...but pressed again, that she should just give us the 4-top. The logic seemed to be lost on her.I said all of this really respectfully and I'd not have pushed the issue if there had already been a wait and they were slammed - We would have waited. It was like 5pm.The GM responded with, \"You know what, you are being really rude right now and I really don't like your attitude, I'll give you the 4-top but you can stop being an asshole\"It took me a good 10 seconds to register what she'd just said, I was almost OK with it until I realized that she just went well beyond what I will tolerate as a customer. I was furious but continued to remain calm pointing out that \"I wasn't trying to be rude and I wasn't the one calling someone an asshole.\" I said the last part with more emphasis and quite loud. It seemed to have startled her, but I was pissed.She said, \"I didn't call you an asshole. I can't believe you'd say that about me, you know what, you can just leave. Just get out right now.\" At this point, I didn't wish to continue this dialog. I motioned to my guests, who were still sitting down (rather comfy, the two of them, in a two top) that we were going to leave. I then hear the woman ask two other guests standing close to us, \"Did you hear me call him an asshole?\". Uncomfortably, they said, \"I don't know, we weren't listening to your conversation.\"I was shocked that she wanted to involve other people into this ugly altercation between the two of us. Even more shocking with this level of pretentiousness - they sell meatballs! I give them two stars for having a decent product. But honestly, I can make meatballs, just as good, if not better, at home and I don't have to put up with that kind of attitude. But hey, at least my guests got to see a real NYC moment, as stereotypical as it might be. At some point, these establishments need to realize that you have to sacrifice the occasional loss of a cover for the comfort of it's customers. This 10 minute issue lost them 3 covers for the day, and additional covers down the road as I'll never go back. The server lost a tip, an especially large tip that I would have given her for accommodating us better than she did.; And of course, there is the damage done by a bad review...", "Date": "2013-03-05", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "R M.", "ReviewID": "KMJitLqEC3zcCyHyvdc7EA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love it here.

A group of five of us decided to go to the Meatball Shop around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. We waited about ten minutes before space was made and the center table. Our waitress was really nice and explained how to order our 'balls. The special meatball was a steak, bacon, and cheddar meatball. The waitress recommended the mushroom gravy on top. I ordered this the \"naked\" way, with rigatoni under and the special salad (arugula and apples) on the side. I was glad I went with the waitress's suggestion! I won't go into everyone else's orders (because I don't remember!) but everyone enjoyed their meal. There was another waitress that pissed me off, though. Since our group was split among both sides of the center table (a bench, really), our food came out as two separate orders. My boyfriend's and my food came out first, but there were two salads; we had ordered one with the intention of sharing. My friend across the table had also ordered a salad and asked the waitress if that was hers, but the waitress got unnecessarily bitchy and said, \"There are TWO orders, and these salads are on THIS order. This is THEIRS.\" Whoa. No worries, I told my friend, we would wait for the remaining orders to come out and see if a salad was left out. Sure enough, her salad didn't come. Also, I saw the waitress refilling the entire rest of the table's waters repeatedly but my group's were never refilled. I was terrified to even mention a refill after the salad fiasco. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt because it was packed and pretty loud. Overall it was okay.

They stand out for being packed with flavor, freshness, and mouth watering tenderness.My go-to meal is The Smash. What is it? 3 large meatballs literally smashed down a little bit and put on a brioche bun as a sandwich. It comes with a great side salad of arugula and baby spinach, oily vinaigrette, and thinly sliced apples. Awesome, refreshing, tasty. The brioche bun is warmed slightly, always fresh, and soft as hell. It can actually be a bit of a problem because I've had it fall apart on me while I was trying to eat it.What's awesome about this place is that you can choose the meat the ball is made of (beef, pork, chicken, etc.), cheese, and the sauce it's in. Just to keep things exciting, they have a special meatball of the day which is always an interesting and creative combination. It's usually paired with a complementing sauce. I do not suggest getting the sliders mainly because they're tiny and $2. Not very good value-wise.I'm actually not a big fan of the ice cream cookie sandwich here either.

The atmosphere of the place was a tad bit small; however I came alone, (I know sad right), and because of that, I was able to be seated quicker at the bar than groups waiting at the door. I know for a fact I'll be paying The Meatball Shop another visit in the future!", "Date": "2012-12-09", "Author_Location": "Queens, NY"}, {"Author": "William D.", "ReviewID": "8X7AD9s6_l15iyWtrCIFHg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Scrumptious meatballs? Certainly. Let me note now that the food here deserves no less than three and a half stars (four stars if you're in a good mood).The measly two stars I've blessed The Meatball Shop at this location with stems from their horrific waiting service and my experience with their uncleanliness. My girlfriend and I first heard only good things about this place; plus, the JP Morgan Chase credit card commercials likely (and subconsciously) led us here around 1 a.m. for some late night grub. I went with the classic beef meatballs and Parmesan cream sauce with a side of their risotto (skip this, meh). While my meatballs were decent, chunky, and had real beef flavor (I've had overly breaded meatballs at some Italian restaurants that should have been re-branded as Matzo balls), the Parmesan cream sauce was king. Each bite was orgasmic. Pair my Parmesan cream sauce with the spicy pork meatballs I snagged from my girlfriend (she ordered it with a forgettable mushroom gravy--mind you, I'm admittedly no expert on mushroom gravy) and you've got yourself a feel-good, comfort food moment. I licked my bowl clean--that was, until I found what looked like a strand of black pubic hair. It smiled at me, bare, curly and grotesque.There was no reason for me to cause a scene, as I've had my fair share of dingy hole-in-the-walls throughout New York. But at The Meatball Shop? I patiently flagged down one of the employees (the guy with the iPand reservation system), told him I thought the food was delicious but that I had found a strand of black hair at the bottom of my bowl. \"Please tell the kitchen to be more careful next time\", I quote.That I received a long, skeptical stare and only a cold, terse, \"uh, sorry to hear that...\" left me wondering whether the restaurant's managers had trained their waitstaff about proper customer service. Why do I say this? The guy I spoke with hid in the kitchen for the rest of the evening and kept looking over at our table. Yeah, don't think I didn't notice, buddy. He never came back. About five minutes later, another waitstaff came by our table and gave us our check for $20.69--to which I gave her $30 and asked for change. She returned with $8, then sped away. Really? $8? What happened to the rest of my change? By now my patience had turned sour and I didn't want to deal with this establishment anymore. I debated leaving a tip. Girlfriend said no, but I was a pushover and left a couple bucks (after deducting what the waitress owed me). I left without looking back.It's upsetting that I won't be returning to The Meatball Shop at the Stanton location. I really wanted to like this place, yet the service was downright shit. They've lost a customer plus many future ones. Yes, friends, strangers, relatives, Aunt Suzie and Uncle Ben will all know.

I had to fight the urge not to order more than I did, there's something about checking off what you want and handing that to your waitress instead of speaking your order that encourages you to just mark off everything that looks good. Right away I noticed that they separate their beef and pork meatballs and they don't let you mix and match. I thought this meant their classic beef balls contained only beef, and was ready to write off their bland flavor to that major omission (a good meatball needs both in my opinion). But I re-read some of the reviews and it turns out ALL their meatballs contain some pork, so maybe the problem is with the lack of other ingredients and spices. I ordered the beef and my friend ordered the pork and neither wowed me. I ordered mine with tomato sauce on top of rigatoni, the sauce tasted pretty generic. I also ordered the green beans with paprika, saffron and onion, couldn't see or taste any onion, but there were some chickpeas thrown in. I agree with Nikko's review that these aren't traditional meatballs, and I guess that's what I was expecting, traditional meatballs that happen to be really really good. The upside was the prices were very reasonable, so I didn't feel so bad about not being thrilled with the food. For two people: 8 meatballs, greens, salad and pasta the bill was $25. Also, hearing Johnny Cash and Queen anywhere makes me happy. Nice cozy decor.

The order to wait time was about 10 minutes or so, not too bad on a busy night.We ordered to go, a chicken meatball hero with parmesan cream and provolone, and a classic naked beef ball with tomato on a bed of steamed spinach. The chicken meatball had good flavor but the parmesan cream was too overwhelming. I do not recommend anyone getting the parmesan cream because it was way too much and overpowering the hero. The beef meatball with classic tomato was delicious and just had to add the spinach to get some greens in. We also got the chocolate chip with vanilla ice cream sandwich which we promptly ate in the car in case it melted before we got home. The cookie was hard but still okay because it had a good crunchy type chewiness but ice cream did not even taste like \u00a0ice cream at all. It was not creamy or milky at all, but more of a frozen texture and lacked complete vanilla flavor. All in all, I thought the food was ok. I had really high expectations based on the number of reviews this place had as well as the ratings. Many friends have also recommended this place previously to me.

They were really nice about letting me stay there for two hours (lol) while I waited. (Disclaimer: Neither of us knew that he was going to be that late). I really liked the ambiance - soft (but not dim) lighting, that blend of trendy and classy characteristic of the LES, and no music. By 7pm, however, the restaurant suddenly filled up and the server kindly came over to tell me that they may have to move me to the bar if I were to just sit there (in nicer words, obviously). I ordered our food and hope that it wouldn't get cold. It came out pretty quickly (within 10 minutes), which was nice. Thankfully, Dawei came pretty soon after that. At that point, they had decided to turn up the music, which made it a bit louder than I had expected. The menu concept is great - I love that they're laminated with dry-erase markers to check off the exact combination you want. We split the spicy pork balls on the everything but the kitchen sink salad (on the recommendation of Yelpers) and naked chicken balls (yuck why that does sound so gross??) with mushroom gravy. My judgment may have been clouded by the fact that I was ravenous at this point, but I loved the salad. No dressing necessary - just marinated, good options as a bed for the meatballs.

The meat ball was very well flavored nonetheless. Nothing was too strong. nothing was too weak and the tartness of the tomato sauce tasted very genuine and homemade.

The food was amazing, as most people have noted. We split the polenta which I HIGHLY recommend, as well as the mixed veggies, which was roasted squash covered with salt, pepper, maple syrup, and walnuts- to DIE for. Super soft and luscious. And as predicted, the meatballs were scrumptious. Mouthwatering little balls of meat. My friend ordered the veal meatballs in the 'special sauce' which she said was amazing. I was less adventurous and ordered the traditional beef meatballs with tomato sauce, and it was still amazing. The wheat bread was perfectly toasted, the meatballs were a great size, and the tomato sauce didn't soak the bread and make it soggy like some meatball subs do.

I came in at about 9pm on a Monday night and this place was PACKED. I could have sworn the lady told me the wait was 1hr and a half! I said no thank you. I went to the takeout counter, if you could call it that. There is NO space in this place, not even to stand to order takeout. I was pushed around at least 10 times while waiting to order. I dont know how the waiters put up with that. This place should be less formal, after all they serve meatballs! The waiter thing is overkill, and causes the wait to be longer. Especially considering how small the place is, you should be able to order and sit as it becomes available. The most spacious place was the 1 bathroom, which actually had walking space and had cute vintage decor. Also they should have beepers for takeout so you can wait outside since it is sooo crowded.NOw to the meatballs themselves.....I ordered the beef meatball smash with classic tomato and provolone cheese. It came with a small arugula side salad with apples for $7. The arugula was BITTER, which eating the sweet crunchy apple helped. I would prefer spring greens, thank you. The actual meatballs were tasty but...THEY WERE JUST MEATBALLS! While the \"brioche\" bun they were placed on was toasted, it just became a soggy mess. The meatball was tender but needed more spices. I had the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich with vanilla. What a DISAPPOINTMENT! The cookie did not have chunks of chocolate like I like, instead was blended into the cookie. Then it was thin and could not hold up the thick layer of ice cream. Blah! The ice cream itself was flavorful and had specks of vanilla in it.

The spicy pork and mushroom gravy was fantastic, it was truly delish. However I can't say the same thing with the special, I think the bread and balls combination they made is blah. The bread itself was hard to chew, the spices in the special meatballs were too strong. I felt I was smoking cumin.

It was nice and juicy, I liked that it wasn't \u00a0rolled too tight so the juices absorbed all the wonderful Italian seasoning. I wasn't too impressed with the pork meatball it was okay, a little dry for my taste. My third slider was the special of the day. It was a lamb meatball, greek-style, very flavorful. It was a little heavy on the yogurt sauce though, which drowned out that lamb flavor that I always look for. I also had the arugula and apple salad. It was very simple with a nice light vinaigrette- a good pallet cleanser as you go through the different sliders. Dessert: Truly the best part of the entire meal. I was like a kid in a candy store. \" You pick\" your choice of a homemade cookie to go with your choice of homemade ice cream to create your own ice cream sandwich. Genius. I went with the chocolate brownie cookie with mint ice cream and the chocolate chip cookie with the espresso ice cream. They were both really good, the espresso ice cream was amazing. Atmosphere: I love the family oriented atmosphere. The selection of music is great. Its loud enough that you can hear it but not so loud that you have to talk over it. The menus are these fun laminated sheets that you check off your order on. Service: The service was a little sparse at times. In their defense it was a Saturday and it was extremely busy.

Yet we (ummm, I) seem to make the same mistake every time: we show up at 8pm on a Saturday night and I sheepishly ask the hostess, \"how long for a party of 8? Oh, shit, 2 and a half hours!? (as if I am somehow surprised after getting the same answer the previous 4 times....) Alright, fine, put my name down.\" But the wait system is a thing of beauty. They text you a link that updates you with the remaining wait time and the hostess calls you a few minutes before the table is ready. And, just like that, the burden of hanging out on a sidewalk or crammed bar so you can hear your name is lifted! It gives you an unfettered opportunity to bomb around LES and drink shitty beer and play pin ball at Motor City just around the corner...or toss back a few appetizers elsewhere during the long wait. Upstairs at Stanton Social, no matter how old and played out that place is, usually does the trick. \u00a0 This is all part of the experience, though. Getting to explore the neighborhood without worrying about missing your name being called is awesome.

Meatballs bring back many childhood memories and haven't had any since then. While browsing the menu, I had my eyes set on the meatball sliders as you can sample different flavors without busting a gut. I was opting to do takeout as I'm located within LES. Once I arrived, I was told that they don't offer sliders for takeout! The girl behind the counter said sliders do not travel well and therefore not offered. She told me the Meatball Mash sandwich was available for takeout and that's what I ordered (beef meatball with tomato sauce & mozzarella). So here it goes:Pros: The meat was very tender and it tastes very home made. I was glad that the food was locally sourced and the freshness of the ingredients definitely showed. Also, I liked how the meat was not salty, greasy and heavy which I fear.Cons: Although the ingredients were high quality and fresh, I thought it would've used more herbal flavoring. Also, I am deducting one star because I think its ridiculous that sliders are not offered since \"they do not sit well\". My Meatball Mash came with sauced meatballs in a brioche bun which became a bit soggy by the time I got home. However, it wasn't soggy to the point where it was gross and mushy. \u00a0Therefore I don't understand how sliders \"do not sit well\" since you're basically putting the same meatballs on a smaller bun. Even if they \"do not sit well\" you can always separate the buns from the meatball if someone gets takeout. I just think its an excuse for them to make more money by forcing someone to order the other things on the menu.", "Date": "2010-07-25", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Emily T.", "ReviewID": "HB4pokehql4ekCwvBtfWkA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was SO excited to try this place...having just moved back from LA and loving all things food in NY I knew that a place dedicated to meatballs would not disappoint...well this was not the case.I went last night with 3 friends who had previously eaten at the Meatball shop and had enjoyed it. \u00a0I got there and was told the wait would be 30 minutes, which is reasonable. \u00a0An HOUR rolls around, and we still haven't been seated. \u00a0We were enjoying the sangria which is delicious but all of us were starving. \u00a0My friends approached the hostesses at various times to check in and see what was going on, but we never got a solid answer. \u00a0If we knew the wait was going to be over an hour when we got there, we never would've stayed and that would be fine. \u00a0However, the hostess was extremely off with her time estimation which was the largest problem.We then watched as the hostess seated another table (after telling us we were the next 4-top) outside, and claimed we told her we didnt want to sit outside (which was not true, in fact we told her specifically we wanted to sit outside). \u00a0Well by the time we were seated and given some free sliders (thanks), we ordered more sangria and a soda that never came (so we cancelled it) and received our food which I must say was just alright. \u00a0Cold side of rigatoni, parmesan cream was way too heavy, sliders had maybe a tiny drop of sauce on them. \u00a0The best part was the ice cream sandwich, perhaps they should specialize in that?", "Date": "2010-11-24", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Rachela m.", "ReviewID": "4MbrSIQKCs-MuF_VK4EyPg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "You can't be disappointed eating there.

You can also order them as Heroes, sandwiched between French bread, or as mini sliders.

It was essentially a huge plate of cooked cold greens topped with three meatballs and sauce. We also had a side of risotto. The meatballs were all extremely tender yet had a slightly toothsome bite which made them pretty perfect. The spicy meat sauce wasn't particularly spicy but had a good tang of tomato and added some juiciness to the meat. I loved the kitchen sink dish as the cooked cold greened provided a good textural contrast and was refreshing on that hot summer day. I ordered a drink which I remember being a lavender lemonade or something similar which was very very good. Our dessert of strawberry ice cream sandwiched between a chocolate chip cookie and a macaroon was also good though I thought the macaroon was a little too chewy.Comfort food at its best and gussied up adorably, the Meatball Shop was a good first meal to kick off our whirlwind food weekend and we left sated and happy..", "Date": "2010-09-15", "Author_Location": "Long Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Billy P.", "ReviewID": "VgwB4P729H3qqJHPeBqpDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "They said it would be a 2 hour wait, but was about an hour and a half. \u00a0They gave us a pager and we walked around the neighborhood. \u00a0Totally worth the wait. \u00a0Meatballs were absolutely delicious. \u00a0I ordered sliders with 3 different types of meat including the buffalo special which was outstanding. \u00a0Ice cream sandwiches (I chose chocolate chip cookies with mint ice cream - it's build your own!) were also delicious as was salad I had with sliders. \u00a0Place is small and loud and typical for New York in that regard. \u00a0Great beer also on tap also. \u00a0Would definitely come back. \u00a0Just keep in mind they don't take reservations and there will be a long wait. \u00a0Loved it!", "Date": "2012-10-31", "Author_Location": "Lyndhurst, NJ"}, {"Author": "Lizz K.", "ReviewID": "DU5emS3KDkAtk6alOtd2LA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Worst Sangria ..

Apparently The Meatball Shop doesn't feel the need to mention that, along with the black pepper and fennel, the \"chicken\" meatballs are also seasoned with PORK.I've since been told that hidden at the bottom of the menu, in tiny, easy-to-miss font, are the words: \"Many of our meatballs contain pork.\" \"Many\"?! They only have four kinds! So let's go through them one by one, shall we?One kind is pork, so we can be pretty sure that anyone who orders those expects to eat pork. \u00a0And although I can't say for sure, I really f*cking hope that the \"veggie\" meatballs don't contain pork. That leaves the final two: beef and chicken. In the description of the beef meatballs, it lists \"prosciutto\" among the ingredients. That's pork, so anyone who orders the beef meatballs fully expects to get something with pork as an ingredient. So basically, \"many of our meatballs contain pork\" is just a sneaky, underhanded, deceitful way to say \"our chicken meatballs contain pork\" instead of just listing pork among the other ingredients in the description.Look, I don't care that they make chicken and pork meatballs. My problem is that they are obviously trying to deceive their customers. I mean, come on: the presence of pork fat in those meatballs is at least as relevant as the presence of BLACK PEPPER.

Meatballs come in a few varieties: beef, spicy pork, chicken and veggie. You can pair them with an array of sauces (tomato, spicy tomato, mushroom, parmesan, etc). You can order meatballs in a sandwich form, or you can order them as \"naked balls\" which is a set of 4 identical meatballs (you can't mix and match the meat varieties) that you can pair with sauces and a starch (like pasta, risotto, mashed potatoes, chickpeas). We had no reference point, so we started out with sliders so we could try a variety of the meatballs. I loved the sliders. We decided we loved the spicy pork meatballs the most (really tender and flavorful), and then we proceeded to order the naked spicy pork balls with spicy meat sauce. It was the ultimate comfort food, love at first bite. The prices are reasonable, as a matter of fact, the meatball orders will cost less than a glass of wine there. Save room for dessert!

Rather, the menus are laminated and dry erase markers are provided at the tables in order for customers to mark up their menus with their selections - very \"green!\" The waitress was really helpful in explaining the different facets of Shop offerings. She was patient and kind throughout our meal, and she was even calm and collected when the table of pyromaniacs two tables over thought setting napkins on fire was a good idea. \u00a0Kudos to her! I was lucky enough to go to The Meatball Shop with someone who was down for trying a little bit of everything, and everything was good! We split 5 sliders, being sure to get one with each sauce and with each meat. Combos were as follows - in descending order of awesomeness: Chicken Ball/Pesto Sauce, Special (Greek lamb-feta mint kalamata olive) Ball/Mushroom, Classic Beef Ball/Tomato, Spicy Pork Ball/Parmesan cream, and Vegetable Ball/Spicy Meat. As far as the Balls were concerned, the standout slider was definitely the Chicken Ball with Pesto sauce. In general, I'm usually not really a huge chicken fan, but this was really unlike any chicken I've ever had before! It was so well seasoned; it was practically like sausage or something. I know it doesn't sound appetizing to describe it that way, but trust me, it was lovely! Everything else was great, good, or at least above average. My least favorite was the Veggie Ball, probably because I hate it when vegetables parade around pretending to be something they are not, i.e. meat. However, if I didn't know it was a veggie \"meatball\" I probably would have enjoyed it more. A general note about the sliders, one thing we had not considered was that the sauce kind of gets lost, so it's hard to really critique the sauces since they were accompanied by both balls and buns. If you really want to have saucy balls, go for the \"naked balls\" (that sounds like an oxymoron). The \"naked balls\" come with 4 balls covered in sauce, but the downer is that you can only pick one flavor of Balls and one flavor of sauce. For our sides, we decided to hit up two of the specials and both were scrumptious! We split the Beat & Ricotta Salata Risotto along with the Collard Greens with Garlic Confit. The risotto came to the table a shocking redish color, thanks to the beats, but was actually fairly mild and the feta added a nice twist. As for the collard greens, I was nervous about them since I was a first-timer, but they were really well prepared and very flavorful - not like eating grass at all! Overall, our trip couldn't have been better. We split a reasonably priced small carafe of wine ($13, about 2 glasses each) and thoroughly enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and the service.

My sandwich... my dear, dear sandwich... was two succulent, moist, almost sweet meatballs smashed down with their signature spicy meat sauce, with the perfect amount of warm, oozing provolone, wedged between what may have been the best part of the meal -- two halves of what they call a \"brioche bun\" but I call a more buttery croissant. It was as if the heavens opened up and smiled down on me on this blissful warm Sunday. I can't believe I had almost left after I had gotten pushed around multiple times just waiting in the small restaurant to order take out. What a moron -- I am so incredibly glad I stayed. I was excited that my \"angel lunch\" as I have taken to calling it, also came with a little side salad... good to get some greens in with the grease. Well the salad was basically dressed heavily in straight oil but by gum if it wasn't the best oil I've ever had. All washed down with a Abita root beer that was ON TAP.

It was very juicy and with the Tomato sauce it definitely gave the dish a very balanced flavor... with the sweet and acidity from the meat and the sauce. Although it was a little different than I expected... but surely a great dish.Spicy Pork Meatballs with Mushroom Gravy... this was the winner of the night. I think this meatball had a very nice depth of flavor. You got the meaty spiciness from the meatball yet accompanied with the Mushroom Gravy... it was just mouthwatering... Juicy, savory.... just delicious. We were so stuffed yet we wanted to munch more on that meatball.Special (Pork, Ham) Meatball with Parmesan Gravy... this was probably the worst out of the three that we ordered. A lot had to deal with the Parmesan Gravy that we had on it. Maybe it would've tasted better with another type of gravy... but the Parmesan one really overpowered the meatball. It ended up that we tasted just the cheese gravy instead of the meat... So definitely were not impressed. PRICES: The meatballs (comes with 4 and a breadstick) costs $7.00. You are able to choose from the Classic Beef, Chicken, Spicy Pork, and their Special of the day. (No mix and match ... sorry) But price wise... its not that bad.DECOR/ SERVICE:Inside it's cramped.. .like SOOO MANY PEOPLE and LOUD.

I suggest take-out, unless you really want to eat in. You cut your wait time from 2 hours to be seated to only 10 minutes being served your food to go. Try the Classic Beef Meatball with the Classic Tomato Sauce. If you never went there before, like me, you should know how the original tastes like in this place. after that DEFINITELY get the spicy pork meatball with mushroom gravy... those would get you coming back for more.

I've been here twice and loved it both times. First time Melvin W. and I were lucky and got seated at the bar after only a 5 minute wait (it was around 6 so the place was busy). I had the chicken meatballs in mushroom gravy and he had the classic beef in parmesan cream. Our verdict was the beef balls in mushroom gravy probably would have been the better choice. Their arugula and apple salad is a light and excellent companion to the heavier meatballs. For desert we had the daily special blueberry ice cream sandwiched in ginger snap cookies. The cookies were oh so delicious but the ice cream might as well have been vanilla----so weak sauce on flavor. The second time we went we got their early and beat the crowd, so we got a table this time. Melvin W. went with the special meatball: lamb with pesto on a hero or a smash? It was sandwiched between some sort of bread and that was a great choice. The pesto can get kinda messy but we're talking spheres of meat covered in sauce...kind of a given. I got the beef balls with mushroom gravy on an Everything But the Kitchen Sink Salad which was that yummy arugula & apple salad, steamed broccoli and artichoke. We decided to give the ice cream another chance, opting for espresso ice cream with a peanut butter cookie and the special honey graham cookie. Again the ice cream was weak sauce, and the pb cookie was soft and could be overwhelming without bland ice cream to even it out. The honey graham however was crunchy and so very tasty.

Let's face it, ball jokes never get old. But since I'm a mature individual, I'll spare you from the jokes about balls and oozing cheese and double-fisting long, crusty rolls into my mouth, and instead, I'll talk about my dining experience in less erotic terms.So I came to The Meatball Shop on a Thursday night after a night of drinking and bar hopping with my friends. The restaurant's late hours are fantastic for drunken derelicts like us, as nothing seems better than a fresh meatball sandwich to help soak up all of the ethanol in our bellies. You can pick the type of ball that you want (pork? beef? chicken?) and the type of sauce as well. I went with the classic beef meatballs and the spicy meat sauce (MOAR MEAT). You can also order your balls sans bread, but I went with the traditional hero (MOAR CARBS). Then, you can top it all off with your choice of mozzarella or provolone (MOAR FAT). Protein + carbs + fat = balanced meal; my parents would be so proud, even if this is coming at 3:30 am after a night of drinking stupid amounts of alcohol. The hero came out piping hot and was superb. The balls were plump and juicy, and the sauce and mozzarella complemented the meatballs well. All of this came loaded on a delightfully crusty Italian roll. A side salad accompanied the hero, and while it was pretty tasty, it was playing second-fiddle to the balls. If you're ever in the mood for some tasty meatballs, whether it's for a quick lunch, a casual dinner, or a late-night munchies stop, the Meatball Shop is a great place to check out. Because when you're blissfully cramming that foot-long into your mouth, licking up those tasty and bouncy balls, and smacking your lips from the delicious smattering of sauce that dribbled out onto your face, you'll be thanking me.**okay, so did you REALLY think that I'd be mature enough to write a whole review without adding commentary like that?

I make them at home, but I love a a good meatball that I DON'T have to make, so I had to check this place out after reading many good reviews. We made our way after visiting the Hester Street Fair, a short walk on the LES. It was a Saturday and I heard there could be lines, but we were seated right away (we were sat at a table with another couple at a outside seat). You use a grease pen to mark the menu's with your choice of meatballs in a slider or mashup or on top of greens.We went for a couple of sliders (wanting to save room for those ice cream sammies we heard that were awesome). I had the chicken slider with mushroom sauce, it's the size of a large golfball and was moist and a perfect size. I could maybe have gone for a second but I also had ordered a green salad (trying to eat some healthy food on this trip) so stuck with my one. My husband on the other hand had three different ones, he enjoyed all three. One vegetarian, one Buffalo Chicken, spicy pork....the vegetarian was an \"oops, I marked the wrong one\" but he said it was actually pretty good. He went for the tomato sauce on his, except the Buffalo Chicken one had some spicy blue cheese sauce? I don't remember he gobbled it down so quick. (must have been good eh?)But then comes the ice cream sammies...oh yeah....I had two chocolate chips with mint ice cream and that mint was fresh mint...wow! And the cookies were crisp and it was melty but so goooood!My husband got brownie cookies with strawberry ice cream, now that ice cream was amazing, I usually don't order strawberry but next time I go I'm getting that flavor! I tasted his and it was so fresh and well trust me it was the best strawberry Ice cream I've ever tried! Off the hook!So it was a fun meal and everything was really good, my salad was the only disappointing thing I know it did say \"rustic\". It really was a bit boring, could have a bit more to it.

And indeed they were right. Certainly, Holzman's culinary pedigree combined with Chernov's loyal following from his years at Frank's helped make The Meatball Shop's opening a highly anticipated event. The food critics and bloggers followed and lines were out the door soon after opening. One visit to The Meatball Shop and it is obvious that not only was the attention merited, but that the lines will not fade in the foreseeable future. \u00a0Actually managing to have a meal at The Meatball Shop's LES flagship can be quite an experience if attempted without strategy. Reservations are not taken so lines are to be expected from 6pm onwards and the wait can be anywhere from half an hour or over an hour. Try to get there before 6pm or make it a late meal destination if you don't have the patience. Then there is the matter of ordering. For a restaurant with such simple fare the menu can be dizzying for a newbie. How do you want your balls? Naked? In sliders? Or in a sub perhaps? But first what kind of balls do you want? What sauce to pair it with? Then there's a selection of sides to choose from. Oh, and don't forget the specials! Really, a math geek can have fun figuring out all the possible permutations from their menu. Have fun with it. Ask your server questions. When you figure out what you want you mark it on the menu card and hand it over to your server. The specials change often but on a recent visit it was spicy Mexican meatballs with tomatillo sauce. Think stuffed poblano chilies in meatball form. Delicious! For sides try the polenta or the risotto. And the market salad with seasonal ingredients makes for a lighter accompaniment. And make sure you leave room for dessert. Their ice cream sandwiches merit special mention. And again, you get to choose the kind of cookie and ice cream you want. You're even free to choose two different kinds of cookie if you're feeling extra playful.

I dragged my friend from work with me as I didn't want to go alone lol.This place is located in the village a block a way from e Houston street. Tucked in a nice side street call stanton. When you enter you walk through this very heavy curtain. I think its only up during the winter months. \u00a0The hostess told us we could sit anywhere we wanted. It was quite empty inside @530pm. My friend and I had a nice 15sec squabble as to who was sitting at the window.she won the window seat! Lol she's a brat !  It is very small inside. But I loved the atmosphere. \u00a0Each table has a flower in the center and as if got dark we had a little tea candle.As you know for those who have been here. And if you haven't, the tables all have a laminated menu and dry erase markers. You mark off what kind of meatballs you want and the sauce. You then have your choice of sides, drinks and dessert. I like that you can order \u00a0your entire meal from start to finish. My initial choice was going to be the classic beef. But then I wanted the spicy pork. no clue which sauce I wanted. So Then I was undecided! \u00a0My friend had settled on the classic beef in the spicy meat sauce with spaghetti. I was still making up my mind when our waitress came over. She totally saved me from myself. She was very friendly! she mentioned the special meatballs. The meatballs of the day or week lol don't remember ... was jumbalaya meatballs. Made from ardouille sausage,chicken,shrimp and rice. She recommended the spicy meat sauce or the parmesan. Damn did that sound tastey and it complety solved my decision making dilemma. For drinks we had the pomergante lemonade (special lemonade of the day ) and I had a cream soda. (my Fave) the lemonade was tastey lol I'm sure it would blend nicely with some grey goose! While awaiting our order I was thinking if the mix of \u00a0jumbalaya ingredients into a meatballs would be a disaster! Boy was I wrong! We must have waited about 15 mins or less for our food. The meatballs were executed in a great way! \u00a0Served with a side of bread and generous heap of shredded cheese! The spaghetti was a little bit over done for my taste. I contemplated if I should have settled on rigatoni instead.Absolutely not! After I got over this tiny detail, I really enjoyed my food. All conversation between me and my friend ceased to exist. After we took pictures of our food to showcase; we really dug in. The only sounds were our forks chinking and mouths chewing. Occasionally she would break and say how good it tasted. This happened at 5-10 min intervals during the meal! But she was right it was a really good meal. I began to wonder if I would have enough room for my dessert!. I had chosen the ice cream sandwich. This consisted of \u00a0chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream. She chose the brownie cookie. I did enjoy my sandwich. But I wished the cookies were warm from the oven. They were hard, I do wonder if that was because of the ice cream. I was expecting an oooey gooey cookie hot from the oven.  If they can make hot fresh cookies ,I'd gladly \u00a0up my rating!...other than this I really enjoyed myself. My next thing is to of course try each of the meatballs and sauces!.... \u00a0plus the ice cream sandwich combos.I shall return with friends! We will have different combinations of balls and sauce.

For some reason, meatball hero makers think that bigger is better. You would think these creators were all closeted Michael Bay fans. Plus, they don't seem to realize how much of a difference some chopped \u00a0fresh basil, high grade yet affordable Spanish olive oil or some Heirlooms from the Farmers Market or San Marazano tomatoes make. The Meatball Shop understands this concept, and is all about the small, easy, additions that make a meatball sandwich shop shine above the rest. They get funky with their meatball selections yet I strongly recommend the spicy pork meatball sandwich on a toasted baguette with provolone. Now, provolone in the Subway sense doesn't add much flavor at all, all it does is not overpower the sandwich, its presence is barley detectable, but at the Meatball Shop, you taste the creamy, melted goodness that maintains a fairly decent kick that holds up well against the perfectly molded, not too big balls of spicy pork that were rolled with care and soaked in a sweet, well salted, ripe marina sauce that had luscious chunks of Roma Tomato in it last time I checked. I'd also get a side of their daily roasted veggies, roasting fresh, locally picked veggies always brings out that ultra sweet caramelized flavor that most hard core carnivores are foreign to all together. I also ordered this homemade lemonade drink that was loaded with fresh mint and it kicked the shit out of any overpriced moijito I ever had, the one at Sea in Williamsburg included. \u00a0The ambiance is chill yet projects more of a dressed up, \u00a0professional feel than you'd expect from a specialty meatball sandwich shop in the heart of the East Village that also offers meatballs in a parmesan cream and mushroom gravy sauce, I'd still go with the spicy pork in a classic marinara though. \u00a0The best part of this meatball experience is that \u00a0you walk out of the Meatball Shop with a renewed vigor and renewed hope in there being such a thing as the perfect meatball hero that makes you feel sophisticated and airy on your feet as opposed to sleepy and predictable whose a step too slow that has a hard enough time standing up on two feet.", "Date": "2010-10-01", "Author_Location": "Scarsdale, NY"}, {"Author": "Michael N.", "ReviewID": "bnH8W6nzCMS7_81cChWXGA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After being a member for so long, and reading so many reviews, I feel an obligation to begin recognizing some of the dining experiences I've had, yet at the same time, reveal the flaws of those that fall short.

After bragging several times by my friend Ben, that his relative, Michael Chernow, was on Jay Leno....yes Jay Leno....and that he was some kind of a wunderkind new, young (31) restauranteur who was in J.Crew catalogues, blah, blah blah...I thought well at least he must be hooked up, so good for him! Now I'm not necessarily a \"meatball\" kinda' guy, so I begrudgingly acquiesced to going to Mr. Chernow's Perry & Greenwich Street MeatBall Shop in the West Village of Manhattan.....and I have to admit I'm so glad that I did!From the minute that we walked into this charming, \"country kitchen-meets Grandma Magda''s kitchen from the old world\" environment, I felt RIGHT AT HOME!We walked into the packed eatery and were greeted by a pretty young hostess who walked us over to the young, dashingly handsome Michael Chernow, who as I mentioned is my friend Ben's cousin, who was actually chatting with his customers. When he saw his great cousin Ben, he beamed with delight and was incredibly nice and welcoming to me too!

Now mind you, my friend Ben doesn't eat meat, so Michael ordered him some vegetarian meatballs and for me (who'll eat anything that's dead) he ordered some pork meatballs (to die for and oh so juicy in a delectably flavorful sauce), some good ole' polenta (which reminded me of Southern grits), a delicious egg plant ratatouille-esque vegetable dish and a crisp green salad with 2 carafes of Malbec..and the fete-de complet dessert was a homemade mint ice cream sandwich in between chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies....SINFUL! \u00a0 NOT A MORSEL WAS LEFT ON EITHER OF OUR PLATES...AND BOY WAS I WRONG ABOUT NOT WANTING TO EXPERIENCE MEATBALLS! Plus, the bathroom was super quaint and cozy with white wainscotting and old photos of unknown people's relatives from the turn of the 20th century. \u00a0I could have lived in that bathroom!

I knew I would be sitting inches away from complete strangers and that was fine, but man oh man, there's only about 2.5 aisles of walking space for costumers so be forewarned, especially if there's a wait at the front of the door. Speaking of wait, we had a 45 minute wait on a Saturday around 4/5pm. They ask for your number to call back and we missed our seating because we decided to stop by that damned Economy Candy store up the street lol. The candy was not worth missing our damn seating, but the hostess was totally accommodating and made sure we got the next available table (only had to wait like 5 more mins, but it was still crowded). So yeah, if you get a 20+ minute wait, I would not walk more than 10 mins away. But seriously, to reiterate the rave reviews, let me just put it this way.... this was the most satisfying meal I have ever had in the city EVER. Yeah, I don't live there, but this was seriously phenomenal and completely simple enough to please anyone. I was a little put off by our server (posh, older lady) when I asked her if xyz tasted like \"swedish meatballs.\" She had the nerve to say, \"I don't know what those are.\" BITCH. How you gonna work at 'The Meatball Shop' and not know what swedish meatballs are!? You think you're too good for swedish meatballs?! Ikea serves swedish meatballs okay?! They're a legitimate meal and not tacky at all! Anyways, after that whole misunderstanding I decided to be adventurous and go for the mushroom gravy (even though I hate mushrooms) and classic beef meatball...I was trying to mimic the swedish meatball taste and I succeeded. That sauce is what Satan serves his Thanksgiving Turkey with. SOOOOOO flavorful! Mushrooms weren't even that bad...totally my go-to when I go there. I also tried the spicy pork and I think my friend had the meat sauce on it; anyways, it tasted like buffalo chicken meat lol. Didn't get to do the desserts because the balls and the simple side salad (arugula and apple slices) were SO FILLING. Very affordable and satisfying meal. You seriously can't go wrong. Not overrated at all, apparently. Look the balls were so good we went back for more like six hours later! (Funny sidebar: Got take out later and reheated my sandwich in the oven. Oven made the bread too hard, so as I was eating all these dangerous breadcrumbs were falling and somehow in some evil world, a breadcrumb stabbed my thumb. No joke.

However, my third visit encountered such an egregious breach of professionalism on behalf of the hostess that it has soured my fond memories of this restaurant. Gather round:Upon arriving at the Meatball Shop around 9pm, the hostess informed my party of four that the wait would be half an hour. That was fine; after having been to the restaurant a couple times before, I knew how the space could get packed. My friends and I genially went to work on a bottle of wine. After about 40 minutes, our hostess sheepishly came over and informed us that the seating delay was the result of a party of four who were dawdling at the table after their meal. And here's where things got a bit weird: she insisted that we \"go over to the table and stare at them until [the party of four] left.\" A few of us laughed at the idea, thinking she was joking. The hostess then went over to the table in question and lingered against a nearby wall, giving the customers the eye. After a few minutes, she glanced back at us, pointedly looking at us across the room and then nodding towards the dawdling party of four. We nervously chuckled, thinking she was joking again. My friend muttered, \"Getting customers to leave isn't our job. It's her job.\" We drank more wine; we were flummoxed, but otherwise fine.10 more minutes passed. The hostess came over again and exasperatedly threw up her hands at us. \"You guys are doing a terrible job of staring at the table to get them to leave!\" she accused. That's when we realized that she wasn't kidding. My friend sputtered, \"But that's not our job! That's your job!\" At which point the hostess escalated her response in a stream of words that I admit I missed, as I cowered out of awkwardness and embarrassment in the corner. That's when my fianc\u00e9 turned to me and said, \"This is outrageous. We're leaving.\" And we filed out, after an hour of waiting for a table.I can appreciate that a hostess's hands are tied when it comes to making a dawdling party leave the restaurant after their meal is over, but asking customers to breathe down other customers' necks in order to get them to leave is out of line. Moreover, escalating a confrontation with a customer who's upset about being asked to be intentionally rude is unprofessional. I do hope someone spoke to the hostess about her immature and amateur behavior, because the meatballs at this restaurant are too good for me to boycott!

I'm spotting a distinct trend in our activities: we will go to the ends of the earth on foot for a delicious meal!!! Everyone's been raving about Meatball Shop, so naturally, we had to try it.. when we got there, there was a 2-hour wait for a table inside. But having trekked all the way across the city for a mouthful of meat, we were not prepared to wait and opted to sit at one of the tables outside. Despite the chillier temperatures. To mitigate the cold, I ordered some tea. I was determined to have my meatballs right away. Anyway... we ordered two heroes -- one with spicy pork meatballs and spicy meat sauce and the other with beef meatballs and the mushroom sauce. At $9 apiece, I would definitely bulk The Meatball Shop in with the city's best food deals. The food arrived fairly quickly, and we promptly proceeded to stuff our faces. I started with the beef meatballs/mushroom sauce. Something was just NOT right about this hero... instead of mushroom, the sauce tasted like some sort of candy? My boyfriend had the same reaction! Vaguely reminiscent of Good & Plenty...? I was wholly confused... and not in a good way. On the other hand, the spicy pork/spicy meat sauce combo hit the spot! Very satisfying, pretty large (although not as big as a foot-long at Subway, as my man felt the need to point out), and great soft texture. Long story short... was this place life-changing? No. Would I trek across the city to fill my mouth at Meatball Shop? Probably not. But would I grab a hero on my way back from Fat Baby at 1am?

No one is getting engaged there, you don't need initimacy.A friend and I went on a weeknight around 9 and waited for about 15 minutes, and then ended up eating at the bar because well, we were hungry and didn't mind. There's a place to sit, a place to put your food, what's unacceptable about this? \u00a0Newcastles are 4 bucks, which is great, and the wines were moderately priced. I'm a sucker for risotto and beets, so my plan was to incorporate those into my meal, no matter what. \u00a0I skipped the sandwiches and went for spicy pork balls with red sauce over risotto. \u00a0I wasn't sure that it would work in a way other than \"I like all this stuff so no matter what I will eat it\", but it totally did. \u00a0DELICIOUS. The risotto was with corn and chaterelle mushrooms, and was perfectly done. I got a side of the daily vegetable, BEETS, with some fresh ricotta, and just went to town on those. Perfectly roasted.

My friend and I went here last night for dinner and arrived around 6:45PM. We got seated promptly because the place wasn't 100% packed. However, we got seated in a tight corner, and it was very very tight for the both of us. I couldn't even tuck my legs in underneath the table all the way. We got a bunch of sliders since that's the best way to try all types of meatballs. I got the classic beef with spicy meat sauce, spicy pork with tomato sauce, i shared a chicken with the special sauce (pesto), and I also shared a special meatball (bolognese) with the mushroom sauce. The classic beef with spicy meat sauce was okay. I thought it was soft and tender, but i tasted no spice from the sauce. However, when i tried the Spicy pork with tomato sauce, i definitely tasted the spice. It was also more flavorful. The chicken with pesto was also flavorful and juicy. I told my friend that I thought the beef one was somewhat soft and juicy but then she told me to try the bolognese, and wowwww it was really tender. It was probably the softest of all the meatballs. It was also seasoned well and flavorful. I definitely recommend the Spicy pork, chicken, and the bolognese special. I'd pass on the classic beef since it's nothign special.For dessert, my friend and i shared the ginger snap cookie sandwich with vanilla ice cream. The vanilla had vanilla bean specks, and it tasted very fresh. It seems like they make the ice cream in house because you can see some ice crystals in the ice cream. The gingersnap cookie was very flavorful as well. It tasted fresh and it was somewhat soft, although the ice cream hardened it. The ginger taste was very apparent but it was not overbearingly spicy. Overall, i enjoyed the food here. The atmosphere is subpar since the place is small and the seating can get very cramped. The music they play was random 80s hits. In addition, because of the small venue, it was a bit loud. A few times, i had to ask my friend to repeat what she said because I couldn't hear her. I'd give 4 stars on the taste of the food but 2 stars on the venue, and the size of meatballs. The ice cream sandwich was actually bigger than i expected so that was a plus. Will i come back here?

Definitely the best meatballs in the city, but NOT the best service in the city!Hands-down the meatball shop has a great selection of meatballs to choose from, as well as how you like them served. What I also looked forward to when I came here were the ice cream sandwiches. You can choose your ice cream flavor (known for their espresso ice cream) and two different types of cookies (I only got the Snickerdoodle, but didn't realize I could order two different types of cookies). I came here on a late Monday afternoon with my cousin (around 3 or 4), and we ordered two meatball entrees, the polenta, a lemonade, 2 ice cream sandwiches, and a bottle of Prosecco. There was no wait whatsoever, practically empty around this hour. So, we took our time enjoying our meal and our bottle of sparkling wine. Everything was fine until towards the end of the meal. I would have given this place a much higher rating if it weren't for the pushy waitress who kept insisting on closing our meal tab. We had just ordered our first dessert, and we were also only a half-a-bottle into our Prosecco, when she kept insisting on closing our bill before our first dessert even got to the table. Moreover, my cousin still wasn't sure if she wanted to also order herself a dessert. We figured that she wanted to get her tip before she switched shifts, but it was very rude of her to have pushed our meal the way she did. And, you could tell she was noticeably fake towards the end when she was pushing us to pay. Not only would I have given this place more stars, but we would have probably tipped her double had she not done what she did. We ended up ordering another dessert (which we had to pay in cash separately), while our last waitress got her tips tabbed up. It was just unnerving that she had closed up our tab so quickly; and yet, she was in no rush to leave because she was lounging around at the bar for the next hour. \u00a0 The food is amazing, but I would most likely choose a different location to dine at the next time.", "Date": "2012-07-23", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Christine J.", "ReviewID": "HQJK5rASlj_6f2r-fx65MQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Came to The Meatball Shop on a Saturday night and it was completely packed, not even room by the bar to wait. \u00a0We left our number and were told about an hour wait. \u00a0We decided to grab a drink at a nearby bar. \u00a0Once we got the call to come back we were seated right away. \u00a0There are tables for two around the perimeter there is a long cafeteria style table in middle. \u00a0We were seated at the long table face to face. \u00a0(You are literally elbow to elbow with strangers.) \u00a0You are given a dry erase marker board style menu. \u00a0There is a large selection of meatballs, sauces and styles to mix and match. \u00a0You can have the meatballs naked, over pasta, as sliders or mashed on a hero. \u00a0There are also sides which we had a nice salad and risotto. \u00a0That night the special was the Cordon Bleu Meatball that we really enjoyed. \u00a0We usually don't order dessert but the ice cream sandwiches were amazing! \u00a0If it wasn't for the cramped quarters I would have given this place 5 stars.", "Date": "2013-03-21", "Author_Location": "Port Richmond, Staten Island, NY"}, {"Author": "Peter K.", "ReviewID": "f_y1-SUnzLlh4El3jaba1A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Been here a few times, tried different combos of their meatball entrees.

Aside from Momofuku Noodle Bar, I'm not a big fan of no reservation restaurants. 1) I'm 300 points from my $50 OpenTable gift card 2) I don't have the patience to wait around. I really had a feeling this was going to be worth the wait. We arrived at 6:30 and were told it was going to be a one and a half hour wait and they took my cell # and told me they'd call me. Interesting concept - I don't have to stand on top of people waiting and I can go grab a drink down the block. So that's exactly what we did. One and a half hours later and two rounds of drinks at The Living Room, I called The Meatball Shop and was told another half hour. We slowly strolled back over and stood on top of the table that was clearly going to be ours. So yes, at 9pm we were seated after two and a half hours of waiting. This food better be worth it, is all I could think.Our waitress came over, gave us the rundown of how the menu and ordering works and we ooh-ed and aah-ed over the many options. I was a bit nervous about the veggie meatballs - she said they were bean based and had mushrooms and I was not feeling that. I just really hate mushrooms and am so particular about my veggie burgers I wasn't sure this was the right move but I was reminded that I was at The Meatball Shop and I had to try the meatballs. Their market vegetable special of the day was brussel sprouts (let the salivating begin...) with onions, apples and candied walnuts. Yes, please. Unreal. I asked the hostess (who I went from hating to loving) what she recommended I ordered and the snappy waitress jumped in and said \"I'm your waitress, I can help you\"...so she gave her recommendation and I didn't take it.Filled out the dry erase menu with my dry erase pen (um, love) and decided on meatballs over rigatoni with marinara sauce and obviously the side of brussel guys. Food came out fairly quickly and we all stopped talking and focused on food. I enjoyed the meatballs but can't say I'd get them again - I'm just so not thrilled with the consistency when it contains beans and mushrooms. The rigatoni was el-dente and had extra delicious sauce. But really, the highlight of the meal were the brussel sprouts. SO flavorful and perfectly cooked and just an amazing combo of ingredients mixed with it. I could have had a larger portion of that instead. My friends loved the risotto with prosciutto and all of their (actual) meatballs. They barely ate the spinach and were quite disappointed in that. I tried their mashed potatoes which were tasty as well.Oh gosh, we had to save room for dessert? We decided we all needed to try different things. I had the brownie cookie with the mint ice cream sandwich. It wasn't your typical mint, it was like a mojito. I'm not even an ice cream fan and I was really impressed by the deliciousness of this dessert.The meal was $80 for 4 of us which considering the long wait and the totally worth-wile food was completely worth it. If and when I go back, I will probably steer clear from the (veggie)meatballs and will stick to the pastas, veggies, sides and such.

I knew the line would get outrageously long on a Friday night at this tiny restaurant so bf and I arrived early, well relatively early at 6:30pm. The place was packed, no surprise, and we were told the wait would be 30 minutes. I was almost tempted to leave and go elsewhere since it was so cold and windy out, but decided to stick it out and just ducked into nearby D-Espresso and enjoyed a macchiato while we waited. We returned to The Meatball Shop 30 minutes and were seated in another 10 minutes. 40 minutes total, not too bad I suppose...I like their ordering system. You're basically given laminated menus that allow you to mark the type of balls, sauce, cheese, greens and sides, and everything else that you want yourself with a dry erase marker. It's pretty interactive and efficient for the servers who don't have to spend much time jotting down orders since this place is constantly busy. A for operational efficiency. I do, however, wish that the waitstaff were more attentive, but I guess you can't expect much from a high-traffic place so jam packed that waiters can barely navigate through the narrow paths in between tables and chairs. The noise level here also gets pretty overwhelming, especially with the music blasting... I found myself having to basically shout across the not-so-long table just so bf can hear me.As for the food, I guess I was not by any means blown away. I ordered the daily soup, vegetable lentil with vegetable balls and \"family jewels\"- a fried egg on top. Bf got the classic beef balls smothered in the mushroom gravy atop mashed potatoes. We also split the daily greens which was labeled as collard greens with garlic confit. I was surprised by how meaty my vegetable balls were, hearty and definitely filling. While I love lentil soup, the variation here was extremely thick almost like a stew. The thickness wasn't the problem though, the problem lied in that it was oversalted... Actually, the balls along with the soup was just a little too salty for my taste altogether. The fried egg on top definitely helped, with the runny yolk breaking up the saltiness just a little. But then again, what doesn't taste good with a nice runny yolk? Bf thought his meatballs tasted good, but nothing to write home about. His biggest complaint was the tiny slice of \"focaccia\" the meatballs were served with, which was definitely too thin and hard and chewy to be considered good focaccia. I had high hopes for the collard greens, mainly because the garlic confit sounded amazing, but was unfortunately pretty let down. The collards were braised well, pretty tender but still tasted fresh, but there was really no trace of any garlic confit to be found. Because of the lack of garlic or ham or any other flavors, the collards tasted quite bitter. I personally don't mind bitterness, but bf had a difficult time eating it and gave up after a few bites. The desserts on their menu looked good (self selection of ice cream sandwiches) but we just decided to go to nearby il laboratorio del gelato for dessert because the restaurant was so loud and cramped.Overall, The Meatball Shop is a bit overhyped to say the least. I'm not sure if meatballs are the next \"big thing,\" but honestly balls of meat, heroes, sliders, and vegetables just are not worth up to 2 hours of wait if you ask me.

And when I speak of meatballs, I speak of those not served with spaghetti and tomato sauce, rather I speak of those served yonder from the land of platinum blonds and yodelers.But sadly, I haven't came across any restaurant in San Fran that specializes in meatballs, let alone even serves a dish of specifically Swedish meatballs. And no I'm not going to count IKEA because I am merely speaking of a restaurant, as in I have to wait 40 minutes to be seated by a pretentious uppity hoot for some mediocre food that costs more than my last week's paycheck. Boo. But back to the story. I never found that meatball restaurant in San Fran, but thank the world for good ol' television. I came across The Meatball Shop during Andrew Zimmerman's NYC: Will Work for Food episode where he played the obnoxious creepy waiter at The Meatball Shop. Amidst his whacky antics, I was intrigued by the restaurant. Meatball Shop? I just knew this restaurant was what I was looking for... ALL. MY. LIFE.Now I would say that I flew 3,000 miles just to get my hands on these babies just to add to the dramatics of this story, but that is a lie. Fortunately Andrew Zimmerman aired that episode a couple weeks prior to my already booked trip to NYC, so I added the Meatball Shop to my list of things to visit while out in NYC. (Screw you Statue of Liberty, I'm here to get some balls!)And The Meatball Shop was just almost, yes almost, everything I dreamt of. Not IKEA? Check.One hour wait? Check.Pretentious hostess? Not really.$$$? Not really.Swedish Meatballs? Kinda.Meatballs? Check!Yeah, like I said, it was ALMOST everything I dreamt of. I ordered the classic beef with parmesan cream sauce on top of roasted vegetables. Ugh, can somebody please remind me to listen carefully when being overly excited? Despite the server announcing what the roasted vegetables were of the day all that registered in my meatball induced brain was \"blah blah blah. MEATBALLS! blah blah blah.\" Gross, the roasted vegetables of the day were arugula and beets. Like really? That's the worst of all worst combos. Bitter arugula and [indescribable horrendous description] beets. I wanted to die. My meatballs were so delicious, but every bite of roasted vegetables made me regurgitate slightly a portion of my delightful meatballs. So I quit the roasted vegetables, but realized the meatballs were too salty without a side. *sigh. Don't you hate when there's some uncontrollable force that just ruins a perfection. Luckily the lover ordered mash potatoes for his side and weighs like negative 100 pounds so I had a backup to that beet disaster. I would say I'd like to come back here the next time I visit NY, but who knows how soon that will be or who knows how forgiving of a person I am when it comes to bitter arugula and nasty beets.

You walk into a nice little place with one communal table and a few two person tables with a bar on one side of the building. When you sit down, the waitresses come over and hand you a menu and a marker to check off what you want. You can get sliders, a dish, etc with a choice of a couple of meatballs and a couple of sauces and a couple of sides (lots of choices to make!) and that's before you factor in the desserts! It's fun to do and the three people I've been there with, who had never been there before either, loved it for being different(a 13 year old girl and a 17 year old girl) than what they were used to, as I did.Went the first with 2 others and we got there about 10-15 minutes before opening and there was a line of a few people in front of us, but we got in right away. I had the vegetarian meatballs(I was a vegetarian at the time) in the red sauce(on a dish). Best veggie balls i've ever had. Actually, best meatballs I've ever had. And I grew up in a 99% Italian neighborhood where every mother served me meatballs when I visited! Even their potatoes were delicious(butter.. yummmmm...) The waitress was lovely and helped my baby sister out with the menu and let her change her order a bit (picky eater) and, due to the place being rather tiny, was always around in case you needed something, not that you really will since this is a rather quick eat(don't count on staying here for an hour)The second time I went, I went with a friend of mine who had been living in Switzerland for a year and we got there a bit after opening and put in the two seaters. It was much emptier than the first time I went, maybe 6 other people in the entire place, so we could hear each other's conversation much better. This time I got the lamb-mint meatballs and.. wow. I never knew I liked lamb(this being about a month after I started eating meat for the first time in 6 years) until I tried this meatball but once I tried it, I was on a lamb frenzy(food carts and gyro places were eaten at aplenty) for 2 weeks. Again, waitress was lovely. Great feeling and she thought it was awesome, told her friends that they had to go later and has made me promise to bring her next time she visits. Potatoes weren't as buttery this time but still good and the ice cream sandwich was delicious, though a bit messy. My friend ended up getting two ice cream sandwiches and was about to buy herself some more meatballs before I remembered my wallet would be emptied for dinner later.It's fine to bring the kids here, people next to us had 3 kids under 6 and the kids were having a blast with the menu until they were even more excited at having meatballs in a restaurant(weird to me, everybody I knew got meatballs(on a hero) whenever they went to a restaurant!) but it's great for a casual date as well.

My bf ordered mashed potatoes with his sliders, and it was also delicious. He also had a soda float with vanilla ice cream.

I may have to pose that question again to any naysayer who thinks meatballs are nothing more than little tasteless balls of mystery meat slopped on top of spaghetti sauced with Chef Boyardee...because let me tell you, the Meatball Shop knows their sh*t. On a crisp afternoon last weekend, I made my over to the Meatball Shop and was met with a light and airy room perfectly complimented with a simple, yet chic bar complete with a board displaying a well-stocked, if short, list of wines and beers and long tables perfect for widening ones arm stance to take a big bite out of a sub. I ordered the famed chicken meatballs in classic marinara, the veggie balls in the spicy, as well as that week's special which happened to be lamb. Holy crap, they were amazing. The five stars come not only from their aroma but from the fact that I actually was not eating them there and then but had to take them to go. Thus, I had to reheat them and even with that minor hiccup, they were sensational. Any food that you can reheat that is able to maintain its full-on amazingness is noteworthy, With 4 meatballs an order, I'd honestly say one person can put down two to three orders...they're THAT good. (And yes, that may be a fat girl comment but i love my meatballs)The chicken were superb as they were not too heavy at all--they leave you wanting more. The veggie I'd have to skip next time. While it's a great option for vegetarians, I found them a bit mealy and dry--the spicy sauce was impeccable however. And finally, the lamb. Mmmmmm. If you are ever there for 'lamb week' you must indulge. While they are definitely heavier than the chicken (um duh...and you can taste the lil extra buttery/heavy goodness in there) they call out to you. I toasted some of my own bread and dipped it in the extra sauce, made my own lil sandwiches, etc...and that, again is the beauty of the meatball from the Meatball Shop...no matter which way you choose to indulge, (they offer sides such as rice, white beans (a nice touch), salads...) they are 110% phenomenal and well-worth the price, Can't wait to try the salmon.Well done.", "Date": "2010-03-09", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "John X.", "ReviewID": "AlqXNm8o0o7Qf0lJSSverQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent place!

If any area can make eating meatballs trendy and worth an hour wait, it's this downtown district on the gentrification fast track while cautiously maintaining is gritty edge. A brilliant concept in my eyes: specialize in one thing and serve it a million different ways. \u00a0Chef Daniel Holzman struck gold, keeping it simple and straightforward, and doing it well. It's all about choices here; have it your way. Pick your ball: beef, spicy pork, chicken, vegetable, or the special; Pick your sauce: classic tomato, pesto, mushroom, spicy meat, or the special (non-existent the day we patroned); and decide how you want it (which is probably the hardest part): naked, on a hero, mix-n-match sliders, smashed on a brioche bun with cheese, on an \"everything but the kitchen sink\" poo poo platter - you name it! Plus, you can get a variety of sides that can accompany your balls separately or integrated into your dish pick! They even have you fill out your own order on a laminated menu aplenty with empty check-boxes (keeping it pointedly casual) as you sip on your carafe of wine (keeping it a dining experience). Rustic wooden tables- and even a communal one- spot the folky \u00a0upscale delicatessen-esque diner, equipped with a full bar flanked by a high-stooled counter and a Take-Out cubby at the back.Our lengthy wait for an outdoor table was worth it, as the breeze carried the aroma of fragrant sauces from the kitchen and the sun kissed our faces. I was feeling particularly spicy on this warm day, ordering the pork balls with the pesto sauce a la \"everything but the kitchen sink,\" which meant atop a platter of almost all the sides I would have loved to order a la carte anyways (but are not allowed to): the daily vegetables, market salad, white beans and greens. Perfection, with one minor flaw: the pesto sauce was unbearably oily. I actually had to mop up the excess shimmer with a few napkins, the puddles at the bottom of my plate a little off-putting. But certainly not enough to mask the delicious rich, mildly spicy flavor of the pork and the garlicky-nutty tang of the vibrant green sauce.I thought at first that my plate may have been free-handedly doused with extra oil because it was presented as a salad, but our chicken meatballs atop the spaghetti \"side\" was also swimming in a pool of oil, thanks to that accompanying pesto sauce. This one was a bit much to handle, so we ate from the top and let those bottom-dwelling noodles enjoy their glistening bath. The three sliders allowed us to try different ball and sauce combos, being the only mix and match order option. After thoughtful consideration of optimal flavor couplings, we wound up with the following pairings (in descending preferential order): the veggie ball with spicy meat sauce, the chicken with the pesto, and the beef with the classic tomato. (The special ball of the day wasn't compelling enough to order in the form of beef Bolognese, and wasn't exactly encouraged by our server either.) Surprisingly I found the classic combo to be the most boring of the three - the beef quite plain and the tomato sauce reminded me too much of the paste from a can. Conversely, I would have never expected the vegeta-ball to be so satisfying texturally and so flavor forward, no doubt, promoted by the savory meat sauce. \u00a0The chicken and the pesto went well together - hence its repeat pairing on top of spaghetti - but that flavor-packed pesto could have made rubber taste good, excess oil or not. But in my opinion, the best ball award \u00a0still goes to the spicy pork! And lucky me, I had three.Sliders and their Sauces: Veg/Spicy Meat, Chicken/Pesto, Beef/TomatoBut luck is hardly the driving force behind this lil' shop. When you visit, know that you can't go wrong in personalizing your meaty dish because the quality of ingredients bursts out of every component.

And there are few dishes as comforting as a nice tasty meat-a-ball (Italian accent, you get it).

Walk up to the counter where they hand you a very basic and easy to read menu.

There is a special meatball everyday, of which I have seen a steak, bacon, and cheddar meatball as well as a buffalo chicken and blue cheese meatball, both outstanding.

We went to the Meatball Shop on Friday, July 5th and only had to wait 25 minutes! Upon arrival the host asked for my phone number and sent us a text message with our approximate wait time. The text had a cool link that allowed you to track your place in line so you could wander around the lower east side while you waited. Within 25 minutes I received a text saying my table was ready. We ordered 2 sliders (a special one w/ special sauce, and a chicken one with parmesan cheese). They were both fantastic. Then we had a spicy pork hero w/ pesto sauce, and a classic beef smash with classic tomato sauce. These were also both delicious. Finally we had an ice cream sandwich (chocolate cookie w/ brown sugar ice cream - highly recommend)! This was the perfect amount of food for two people. In total the bill was only around $45 including beer & sangria.

We were lucky enough to find three open seats at the bar and were seated immediately upon walking in. The hostess had told us that there is usually a 30-45 minute wait on busy evenings, which is the norm on most nights. One fun thing about The Meatball Shop is that diners get to check off their selections right on the laminated menu page with dry-erase markers. The Meatball Shop has a variety of meatballs, sauces, and sides to choose which are all moderately priced. With a list of specials written on a small chalkboard hanging on their wall and an open kitchen, The Meatball Shop is a dainty yet authentic Italian restaurant. \u00a0The girls and I started off with drinks; house-made sangria for me, the witch's brew for Sunhye and the raspberry mint lemonade (the day's special drink) for Amanda. Shortly after getting our drinks, our food came out. The great thing about being seated at the bar is that your food tends to come out faster than people seated at tables. I had ordered the chicken meatballs with mushroom gravy with a side of the day's special portabella and spinach risotto. The dish comes out with four meatballs drowsed in sauce with aside of focaccia bread. I absolutely loved my chicken meatballs. The mushroom gravy was hearty and homey, a dish that reminded me of a warm holiday meal. The only downside to the gravy was the seasoning; it was a bit too salty for my tastes and I definitely would've preferred it with more pepper. What disappointed me was the portabella and spinach risotto. I expected a creamy blend of rice, portabella, and spinach, but what I received was a plate of undercooked risotto. There were flakes of crispy rice, and some of the spinach was still raw. Although my chicken meatballs and mushroom gravy were rich in flavor, the risotto was not up to par.Since the three of us had all ordered separate combinations of meatballs and sauces, I was able to receive different tastes of what The Meatball Shop had to offer. Sunhye had ordered the special of the day meatball (steak, bacon, and cheddar) with parmesan cream on top of mashed potato. This was absolutely delicious. Everything in this dish was creamy and rich with cheese, and it even had a slight smoky taste, which I found to be a perfect complement to the overall heavy dish. Amanda had ordered beef meatballs with spicy meat sauce and a side of the portabella and spinach risotto. Even though the sauce that she chose was a spicy meat sauce, the overall dish was light, clean, and fresh with a slight spiciness and zesty flavor to the sauce. To top off our meal, we ordered one of their famous ice cream sandwiches: espresso ice cream in between two snicker doodle cookies. After tasting this concoction, we all understood why ice cream sandwiches are the most popular part of the meals here. The refreshing ice cream had a creamy and rich flavor, and the snicker doodle cookies that held it together had the sweet and chewy taste that a properly baked cookie should have.

We both preferred the pork to the main dish of beef balls with traditional red sauce. Call me a momma's boy but I prefer my grandma's meatballs any day of the week.

There are four types of meatballs - beef, spicy pork, chicken, veggie, and then a special ball for the night - when I went it was Jamaican Jerk Chicken. You can then get each ball served either \"naked\" just with sauce, on a hero with cheese, 'smash'd' into a brioche bun, or on top of a chef's salad. There's also sides like spaghetti, risotto, polenta, rigatoni, and vegetables like mashed potatos and spinach if you rather go that route - sides can also be served under your meatballs. On each dish you can choose from a variety of sauces and gravies besides the traditional tomato sauce, and choose your bread if necessary.Of course, you're experience here is going to be based entirely on if you like the meatballs or not, and people seem to get very picky about meatballs. It's one of those dishes that someone's favorite meatball could be someone else's least favorite. I found them to be very good meatballs, but for a place that serves them exclusively, it wasn't much different then going to a great Italian restaurant - and I'd have the choice of ordering a ton of other dishes to round out my meal. The one exception was the Jerk Chicken meatball - which on a slider came with a mango sauce/relish that fit perfectly. This meatball, and I'm sure some of their other specialties, are different and tasty.Overall, it's relatively inexpensive - 3 dollars a slider, 9 a sandwich, 7 for 4 meatballs - but it's an extremely limiting menu - its hard to get yourself a traditional appetizer and a main, you kinda just have to share and mix up a few different dishes.

I also used to love the Meatball Shop. Therefore, it is with sadness that I am writing this poor review. I've eaten here several times before and the experience has always been wonderful. The meatballs succulent, the pasta al dente, the sauce, delicious, the service attentive without being overly so. The past few times we've tried to come there has been a long line so we've gone elsewhere. We tried our luck tonight.The good: 1) Thursday at 7:30 p.m. was a good time to come. We were told the wait would be about 20 minutes and instead it was about 10 at most. \u00a02) They added a new iPad reservation system where you leave your mobile number and they'll text you when your table is ready. The bad: 1) the meatballs!!! I ordered the classic beef with a side of pasta. I was so excited to take a bite of the meatball, but when I bit into it, I got a mouthful of gristle. I took another bite and again, gristle. The meatballs were also a chewy rather rubbery consistency instead of being tender and moist. If it wasn't for the sauce, the meat would have been inedible. I ended up spitting out the gristle and chewy bits into my napkin. By the time I was done, my napkin was full of sub par meat. (sorry, I know it sounds gross). The sauce, too, was not as flavorful as before. The pasta, however, was cooked just right. My friend ordered the spicy pork meatballs with pasta. He said his dish was average, nothing special. 2) the service. The hostess who seated us and the person who cleaned our table and brought our food were very pleasant. Our waitress, on the other hand, was not. She rushed to take our order. Once the food arrived, she never checked in with us again. We actually needed an extra place setting. We had to flag her down. She gave us attitude when she brought the setting over. She disappeared and didn't come back until we asked for the check.Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. Initially, I was so excited to eat the food, but sadly it just wasn't good. The restaurant's namesake is the Meatball Shop. \u00a0The meatballs, if nothing else, should be the stand out items. The mediocre service only added to the disappointment. If the food was extraordinary, like the other times I've been here, I could look past the bad service. When both quality of the food and service are bad, it just isn't worth it. The saving grace is that I didn't have to wait long to be seated. Too bad it was a short wait for mediocre food...This place has gotten so hyped up. Maybe it was just an off night or perhaps they are trying to crank out volume over quality. I used to love this place. It was the go-to neighborhood meatball joint. I definitely won't be rushing back any time soon.i was going to give 1 star, but my friend convinced me to add an extra star since they added a cool reservation system.", "Date": "2012-11-26", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Tikhon B.", "ReviewID": "z2vpBUtR99wobZ8On380uA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "don't try ordering takeout from here -- 15 minutes just to get someone on the phone.", "Date": "2013-10-13", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Ruchita M.", "ReviewID": "eosL7Y3vSd4CBU50Xax69g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great food, even for vegetarians!", "Date": "2013-05-04", "Author_Location": "Union Square, Manhattan, NY"}, {"Author": "mia w.", "ReviewID": "bt0JLO9DsdF1_eNiS6a72Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "officially obsessed-i've eaten here 4 times already this week.not kidding. they are open til 4am (+1 star), have ice cream sandwiches with your choice of ice cream and cooke (espresso ice cream with PB cookie=bomb), and a variety of meatballs in a menage of your choice. take-out is good because it's getting crazy crowded, but the food looks and tastes better when you sit down to eat. go now!", "Date": "2010-04-06", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Marc O.", "ReviewID": "oh96UlnGK32_Wmkr0NsWpQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I was a kid my Mom told me not to overfeed my goldfish because they would just eat and eat and eat until they died. \u00a0I always thought my goldfish were pretty stupid if that were truly the case. \u00a0Then again, it could be that Tetra-Min fish food is the pescian equivalent of meatball sandwiches for me.

Everything about the place is new age hipster, from the staff right down to the way you order.The interior decor felt very family style/cafeteria. There were several 2 seat tables surrounding a large 12-16 seat table in the center. The decor was pretty chic, but the wall behind the bar was lavish while the opposite felt out of place. It was just solid color paint with old pictures hanging on it.The way you order your food was even more new age. You don't even tell the server what you want, you write on the laminated menu with a dry-erase marker and hand it to them. I was a fan of the gimmick. It makes sense for a place that sells only a handful of plates, but each with a large range of customization. It must expedite the process of ordering and decrease errors.The food was simply alright according to my tastes. The meatballs were very much Italian in style. They were very heavy on the spice, almost its detriment. I had the chicken meatballs with mushroom gravy atop rigatoni. The sauce with the rigatoni was awesome, albeit scarce. I would have liked more in my order, however there were 4 meatballs. You may dismiss 4 meatballs as petty, but I assure you these meatballs are quite large (I'd say 30% larger than a golf ball).

Neither did I until I stumbled upon the bustling Meatball Shop. Intended as a favored stop for Lower East Side bar seekers, the Italian restaurant is known for its hearty spheres, complimentary sauces, and relaxed vibe. The menu is modest yet full of choices. First, hungry patrons choose from five types of meat balls: Chicken, Beef, Spicy Pork, Vegetable, or the Special: in addition to the consistent fare, there is a daily unique offering of selections. From there diners may choose a sauce whether is it Parmesan Cream, Pesto or one of their other three selections. At this point it's all for the taking. How would you like your entr\u00e9e served? Would you like to have them as sliders, heroes, or a smash sandwich - two meatballs \"smashed\" on a toasted brioche bun. All sandwiches are served with your choice of mozzarella or provolone cheese, a sauce and a side salad. Hungry for more choices? Here comes a curve \"ball\"- Everything but the Kitchen Sink - a dish of your choice of meatball, a sauce, a side salad and mystery side of fresh vegetables. It's a mystery because the chef chooses which vegetable to serve as the plate is being made. It's a dish of true inspiration. If you're feeling frisky, add an order of The Family Jewels on top of your sauce main dish - a cheeky choice of a fried egg.One of the most appealing elements of the dining experience is the ordering process. Guests can write on the menu, seriously! The laminated bill of fare, accompanied by markers, allows you mark off your food selections for ease and convenience.The day I visited, the special was Buffalo Chicken Meatballs with a Blue Cheese Sauce. Although tempting, as a novice to the meatball fan club, I learned that you could never go wrong with ordering a Smash. My \"smashingly\" delicious sandwich consisted of a Spicy Pork meatball covered in Classic Tomato Sauce with melted mozzarella cheese. The side salad was a beautiful surprise of arugula greens, fresh apple slices, chives, and a light 'n sweet vinaigrette dressing which nicely complimented the spicy pork. I enjoyed the peppered pork, but it could have withstood a stronger punch. Portions are not for a glutton, but \"just enough.\"The Meatball Shop is extremely affordable. Nothing on the menu is over $10. What a find!

(Saturday at 2 p.m.) This place has a great vibe once you're inside. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I loved the creative way they take your order!The menu was fairly simple, but we came for the meatball hero. That was easy. Once we selected the type of meatball (spicy pork), the type of sauce (spicy meat), the cheese (mozzarella), and the baguette (white)- we waited about 5 minutes before our order was up! We were both shocked at the speedy service and the yummy presentation. For $9.00 you get a large sandwich with a side salad. The salad was uninspired and pretty flavorless, but I was pleased the focus was on the sandwich.The bread on the sandwich was quality, but if I had one critique it would be to toast the bread a bit. I know that heroes aren't usually toasted, but I think the heavy filling would benefit from a little crunch on the inside. The meatballs were flavorful and the sauce was great as well. The sandwich was very filling and I only made it through half-- my boyfriend happily polished this one off for me.The restaurant had some yummy looking drinks (sangria & the like.)

It's all the rage right now. In December 2009, Bon App\u00e9tit showcased the meatball on its cover and coronated them \"The Year's Top Dish\". Chefs around the country are reinventing the meatball, using top-shelf ingredients such as duck, foie gras, short ribs and blue fin tuna. What is it about the meatball that sends the culinary public into a sentimental frenzy? Comfort food always gets well received when times are tough..right? Yet, I thought the comfort food craze was over. Or maybe the appeal is that they are..well..just plain fun? Aren't they just spheres of ground meat.. mixed with eggs, herbs, spices, bread and grated cheese and then simmered in sauce for several hours? No big deal. Or is it? I decided to look further into the sensation and visited the recently opened Meatball Shop located on Stanton in the Lower East Side. Growing up in New York, close friends Daniel Holzman and Michael Chernow were exposed to great food. Holzman honed his haute cooking skills with a five year stint at Eric Ripert's legendary Le Bernardin and then at Fifth Floor in San Francisco. While Mr. Chernow has made quite a name for himself at neighborhood homestyle Italian mainstays Frank Restaurant and Supper. Since I work nights, I arrived at the daily opening time of noon, my usual dinner time. The spacious room has a formal communal table area and a dining counter/bar, the popular suspended Edison filament lighting, subway tiles, brick face walls, vintage framed wedding photos, a self-service counter and Chernow's signature open kitchen. The menu is set up in a check-the-box, mix-and match format. You can choose meatballs and sauce served in a bowl ($7) with focaccia, or as mini sliders ($3), or in hero form ($9). The kitchen begins each day at 8am to start the process of forming the meatballs and preparing the sauces. The orb variations include beef, salmon, chicken, veggie, and spicy pork along with a daily special. The sauce selections include Parmesan cream, classic tomato, spicy meat, and mushroom. The service is friendly and every guest is acknowledged upon entering \"the shop\". My charming, tattooed-sleeved counter server Janet poured me a glass of 2007 Cesani Sangiovese ($6). Unfortunately, it tasted like it came from a bottle that was opened a day or so earlier. Sangiovese tends to turn quicker than other red wines made from finer grapes. A new bottle should be opened daily. Chef Daniel, who sat down and conversed with me several times, was nice enough to pour me a glass from a fresh bottle \"on the house\" even though I did not mention the poor quality of the first offering. But you could tell the difference like night and day. I ordered four sliders and two sides. I paired the beef with the Parmesan cream, the salmon with tomato sauce, the chicken with mushroom gravy, and the spicy pork with spicy meat marinara. Now, I'm Italian, I've been around when it comes to meatballs. These gourmet meatballs can compete with some of the best in the city. They are \"Arthur Avenue\" worthy. I put them up there with Joey Campanaro's (The Little Owl) Sliders, Simone Bonelli's (Perbacco) meatball appetizer and Cesare Casella's gems at Salumeria Rosi. The sides are divided into two categories: \"Stick To Your Bones\" and \"Greenmarket\". I ordered the risotto ($3) and the rigatoni ($3). The servings are small but satisfying. But, I found two problems with the sides. My risotto, albeit amazingly flavorful, was served just luke warm. Risotto MUST be brought out the moment it is done..\"piping hot\". If allowed to sit around and cool down, it coagulates into a starchy mess. Also, the tasty rigatoni was \"al dente\" but more so on the side of undercooked. Since rigatoni is thicker pasta, it needs to boil about two minutes longer to reach proper \"al dente\" texture as opposed to linguini which is thinner. No worries. Once the kitchen makes these minor adjustments, these two dishes will be some of the best \"Bangs for the Buck\" south of Houston Street. For dessert, The Meatball Shop is a family affair. Donna Chernow, Mr. Chernow's talented wife, concentrates her pastry skills in the baking of her fresh cookies and homemade ice cream sandwiches ($4). Another great value, these generously sized treats can be matched with five different cookies and five choices of ice cream. I was partial to the Brownie Cookie with Mint Ice Cream. Even better was the Ginger Snap with an awesome Espresso Gelato which was just brewing and brimming with coffee flavor. Lunch with wine, tax and tip was $45.", "Date": "2010-03-11", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "big sue y.", "ReviewID": "Xhh3cQeXhHr4_lbRAz2dlQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i see that there are already fans on yelp - and i will gladly join that group!heard about it through an email sent out at work - since our headquarters is in the LES - we are always on alert for new tasty food options...was supposed to meet my lovely friend for dinner - as she had also heard of the new opening - we gladly met up there. had a seat at the bar - was mildly annoyed by people reaching over us for drinks and bumping into us while we were trying to enjoy - but i guess it's something to deal with when sitting at the bar... we ordered meatball sliders and some sides to share - everything was delicious and on point! at first the steamed spinach looked not very steamed and just not right - which the bartender commented on as he checked on us - so he ordered up a complimentary side of kale for us - which was very sweet of him, and very tasty for us! the glasses of wine we had were terrific as well..this place had the feeling of being open like an old pro - as opposed to the first official night! people at work have already been trying to order for lunch - i had to break the news that they are not quite on lunch yet! i kind of dont' want to post this, because i don't want it to become a mob scene, but i suspect that regardless of my review, it already will!", "Date": "2010-02-10", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "around town e.", "ReviewID": "D7qhtvmIW1n5WACJCIR5KA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pretty tasty meatballs.

We ended up waiting for another 45 minutes..So, overall wait time, 2:45 minutes....A little much...On top of this, the bartender threw two of us out of our seats at the bar as they need it for people who were gonna eat at the bar.. \u00a0I felt that he could have been nicer about it...When we finally set down to eat, the food came out all on once...No apps, entrees..Just everything together..Also, they kept on bringing us wrong food that we did not order.. We had to order my husband's dish three different times... The food.. I dont know..It was ok...we had their special slider, beef meatball hero and some polenta with spicy pork meatballs, as well as the rigatoni with spicy meatballs and spicy tomato sauce. I liked the hero but at the same time, I think my local pizzeria will have the same hero and without the three hour wait time. I do have to say that their ice cream sandwich was divine.

But much to my surprise, it was anything but. It's super cute with little wooden tables and small vases with different flowers. And now for the food...If you like burgers, pizzas, and can appreciate sliders, this is the place for you. My boyfriend loved it because each slider is essentially one bite of a fresher, saucier burger. That, and you can customize each slider so that you're pretty much getting something different with every bite. I loved it because 1-2 sliders here is perfect for the kinda girl that doesn't always want to be eating a burger with burger juice dripping everywhere, like me. Don't get me wrong, I love love love a good burger (shake shack or five napkin burger), but you just dont always want THAT much food. Plus, they're meatball sliders, meaning more meat to bun ratio! And best of all, they have ice cream sandwiches for dessert! Perfect for those of us who still love childhood snacks but want something more high quality. You can even pick the cookie and ice cream for different sandwich combos! All in all, this is a super cute, yummy place to go with friends or a date. Certainly not a first, second or third date, but perfect for a low key date night. Can't wait for the next time we come here!

I waited about 22 minutes, which was a bit long for me, but I soon had my order and headed out to eat in the park nearby. I wasn't truthfully thrilled with the sauce, it was for me, a bit sweet and too much. Plus, the brioche and meatballs were on the small side. I wish I had ordered the hero, in a classic style, and in fact I will on my next visit.

It tasted just as good (if not, better) than the spicy meat sauce . The risotto tasted really good too . It was nice and flavorful ... it went perfectly with the mushroom gravy sauce . Their lemonade and root beer were both just decent . I love this place ... I wish there was a meatball shop close to where I live . I recommend getting the pork balls w/ the spicy meat sauce or mushroom gravy sauce and w/ either spaghetti or risotto .

The Spicy Pork balls with Spicy Meat Sauce complimented each other with a huge kick of flavor! I'm not that into spicy pork but my friends really loved it. Classic Beef and Classic Tomato sauce was a little bland in my opinion compared with the other two but it's still a classic! The \"Naked\" balls came with a lot of sauce so it was great to savour with the Focaccia bread after we devoured the balls.

It's sort of like our version of \"Central Perk\" but for dinner. I'm always singing it's praises and trying to convince friends- even the vegetarians ( and I know how wrong that sounds) to check it out. BUT...even with outdoor seating, The Meatball Shop is TOO FREAKING SMALL of a venue for the following of devoted patrons it has amassed.I'm not complaining about the 40 minute to an hour wait time for a table. This isn't my first rodeo so I know enough to put my name on the list and head straight over to Pianos (a block away) for 1/2 off drinks at happy hour. But last night at the Meatball Shop, our server was literally rushing us out the door. There were only 2 of us and we had JUST paid our bill and proceeded to finish the at least 3 tablespoons of wine in each of our glasses when he came swooping in to take them away. I had to yell after him to give them back because we OBVIOUSLY weren't finished. So he apologized and put the glasses back on the table. I guess that was hint #1 that now that we had paid, they needed us to leave to turn over the table to the next group of patrons.Hint #2 came shortly after when the server came back around and scooped up the dessert dish from the couple seated next to us, which still had at least 1/3 of the ice cream cookie sandwich still left in it. The woman at the table grabbed the plate from him and put it back on the table and I literally started to laugh out loud! I mean... I was starting to think there had to be a hidden camera somewhere and this whole scenario was being taped for one of those Dateline shows like \"What Would You Do?\" or something. But no...if you can imagine it gets even better because hint #3 that we had overstayed our \"visit\" came when the hostess literally came over to us and told us that people were waiting for our table and if it was possible, we needed to leave now that we had paid. We were in complete shock!!! I had NEVER in 7 years of living and dining in NYC and 30 years of life on this planet been rushed out of restaurant like this. I've never worked in the food industry myself, but isn't there some unwritten rule that you don't force patrons from their table, especially if they're still dining?!!! Please, someone correct me on the proper dining etiquette if I'm wrong, but for goodness sake, we waited an hour for the table and were only seated at the table for 45 minutes!!To summarize: Although the Meatball Shop has recently put a bad taste in my mouth, the food really is amazing.

I've been talking with friends about going here for months and finally made it with Jade N. Friday night. Yep! I've had the balls. Arriving at 5:45 this place was PACKED. I put my name down for two and stepped outside. By the time Jade arrived they were ready to seat us in minutes. There's usually a wait, and they originally told us it would be 30. We were seated in less than 5. Awesome. This was my first time at The Meatball Shop and I found the way the menu works interesting. Laminated, you take one of their nifty makers (check the pics) and mark what you want front and back. Be sure not to miss the desserts! Luscious ice cream paired with chocolate chip, brownie, gingersnap, peanut butter or macaroon cookies. Mmm Yum! - don't forget to check the specials menu. Ball of the day ::licks lips:: salad, sides and ice cream. Our waitress approached us after a few minutes and since Jade had already been there, we were ready to order pretty fast (especially me being a rookie). I opted for sliders and a side of mashed potatoes. Jade opted for the Balls Al A Carte. After about 45 minutes of waiting and making idle chit chat with our Italian neighbors, our waitress apologetically told us our food would be out shortly. Embarrassed by the amount of time it took to serve us, a very attractive server/ maybe restaurant manager came over to us to apologize for taking so long and put dessert on the house and offered us drinks gratis. We passed on the sangria since Jade doesn't drink and I don't really either (except for a nice wine or some shots) and opted for their Summer Berry Lemonade. Yum! Jade and I were both very impressed. We hadn't even complained that our food was taking so long. Out loud anyway. Each meatball slider was quite delicious but my favorite was the spicy pork. Don't let the word spicy deter you. It's more of a pleasant kick that makes you go \"Ooo!\" The mashed potatoes were heavenly. Coming from me, that's an uber compliment considering my Aunt makes the best mashed potatoes on earth. Southern style recipe passed down from my Uncle's relatives who were slaves. These were comparably delicious. Creamy/buttery, topped with chives, small pieces of scalloped potatoes I practically licked my plate clean. Next up, our free dessert. Delicious homemade ice cream packed between two delectable cookies I opted for vanilla with chocolate chip and Jade for strawberry with ginger snap. Both were drool worthy and we finished them up loving every bite. Now, since I had been really excited to go to this place, my boyfriend wanted me to bring him a treat to try. Meatball sammie he asked for so when our dessert came our waitress put in my order for a meatball smash with provolone for my man. This time our order was ready quickly and she neatly placed the bag on the back of my chair to take when we left. An FYI, if you want to do takeout too, they don't do sliders. Everything else is fair game. Now for my signature part of the review, the bathroom. Hidden behind a thick dark wooden door with just a simple rooster plate on the front, the bathroom is actually really nice. Decorated with an old time summer countryside feel the bathroom smells fresh. Accessorized with a large wooden table, large pedestal sink and a Toto toiled (info courtesy of Jade N.) The bathroom is actually inviting and lends positively to the dining experience. Interested in what it looks like? Check out my pics :). I've already been planning to come back with a few friends after some LES rooftop fun before Bruno Mars this month but after our nice experience here and the staff's attentiveness to our lengthy wait for food, telling us they hoped it didn't deter us from visiting again, I'll definitely be back.

I have to tell you though; their food is worth every second. After we got situated at our seats at the bar, we scanned the menu.

My friend ordered spicy pork meatballs with spicy meat sauce, and I picked classic meatballs with the classic tomato sauce. The Meatball Shop is no joke, they \u00a0know what they are doing. My grandpa makes the best meatballs I know of, but these are an extremely close second! Each meatball dish is accompanied with a slice of foccacia, perfect to help you wipe your bowl clean!
