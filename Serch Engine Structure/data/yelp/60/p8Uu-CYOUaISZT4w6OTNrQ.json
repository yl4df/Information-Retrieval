We found it on Yelp with high reviews so on our Boston trip we stopped in. There was a crazy long line outside while none of the other restaurants had no wait.

She was the newest employee with 9 years there!Food: we shared the calamari and garlic bread to start... Both were yummy! We also shared a bottle of wine for 2. The wine is VERY reasonable.. $18 for a bottle. I had the \u00a0lobster raviolis which were fantastic and worth every calorie! My Bf had the swordfish and grilled veggies... Everything cooked to perfection.The best part... Apps, dinner and bottle of wine for 2 people.. All of which were delicious... Only cost $65!

The sauce was perfect flavor! Not sure if the dish would've been as food w the scampi or pesto... Definitely worth a try though! There was definitely enough to feed 3 people!

We went early on a Thursday to avoid a massive line around 5:30p. We must have been really lucky because when we got there, only one couple was in line ahead of us. Now granted it had been raining all day and was still semi sprinkling at the time. While we were waiting, we noticed that the lady who seemed to be the owner was not the friendliest... but hey i guess you don't need to be when your food is that good and people still line up for it. It did make me a little nervous about the kind of service we would get once we were seated. Luckily our waitress was incredibly friendly.To start off we got a small order of calamari. I was very pleasantly surprised by the size of their small. I'm not going to lie... my stomach would have been content after our appetizer. The calamari had just enough breading and was crispy on the outside and a good breading to calamari ratio. I loved the fried jalapenos that went with it.Then our main dishes came. My boyfriend got the fusilli with lobster and shrimp, and I got the seafood pasta that came with half a lobster, mussels, and clams. We both got it with the Giacomo sauce, which is basically their regular red sauce that they use to cook the lobsters in and then they add a touch of bechamel. OMG it is freaking amazing!!! Next time I want to try the Fracomo sauce which is the same thing but they add crushed red peppers to give it a little kick. These dishes were unreal. There was no shortage of seafood on our pastas, and the flavors were nothing less than spectacular. Probably one of the best meals I've eaten. The best part... everything is extremely fairly priced. Our meal which included a bottle of wine, an appetizer, and 2 pasta dishes came out to about $70 after tax.", "Date": "2014-07-08", "Author_Location": "Addison, TX"}, {"Author": "Paulina B.", "ReviewID": "fTMQQbZ_7bfRXXrPvnf7sQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I live in the neighborhood and always see this place packed. People are waiting in crowds out in front, so that's obviously a sign it has to be good. We had friends visiting from out of town so we made a reservation two weeks in advance. It shouldn't have bothered to waste my time because when we arrived at the restaurant, we still had to wait almost two hours for a table. The service was extremely rude, I've never experienced anything like it. They were disrespectful, and treated us very poorly. They were taking additional reservation on the phone, letting others cut in line, complete chaos. We made friends in line after waiting so long, and only got a table after agreeing to split a table for eight with our new friends (also a group of four). The food was decent, but the horrible experience definitely damped any reviews I might have of the meal we ate.

I'll never again be satisfied with the noodles I make at home or the ones I order elsewhere.I had the best pasta dish of my life at this restaurant, and I'll dream of Giacomo's until I return. Angels sang when the plate was set before me. Perfect texture, al dente, flavorful, and everything else a noodle should be. This should be enough for you to get over to Giacomo's, but if you need more convincing, read on...I had a special --\u00a0homemade fusilli noodles with shrimp and lobster in a scampi sauce --\u00a0but if you can't get this dish, just order another one with the same noodle type. I liked that the menu is fairly small and the dishes are fairly straightforward. There's a lot to be said for mastering the basics and making them taste so delicious.Like the rest of the Yelp crowd, I waited in line to be seated. It was down to the corner of the street and as a party of one, it took about 45 minutes to be seated. Sometimes you share a table with another party, but I had one of two seats at the bar. They were a bit squished, but I wasn't bothered at all, and I had a nice view of the other 9 or so tables in the restaurant. I could also watch the cooks do their thing! I did notice that a party of bigger guys seemed to have some trouble crowding into their seats -- just something to take into consideration. In general, I have little sympathy for all the people complaining about the tiny space and crowdedness of the restaurant. A glance in the door or through the giant windows at the front of the building can tell you what to expect in advance. If it's not your thing, move on! Service, as you could imagine, is fast. They have a lot of people to accommodate! Again, I generally agree that rushing through a meal is no fun, but I didn't feel rushed so much as I understood their interest in efficiency. With a line that wraps around the corner and prices that are super affordable, it's understandable that you can't take all the live long day dining. If you did, they'd never seat anyone or make any money. \u00a0Others have suggested that you should have an idea of what you'd like before you're seated, which is reasonable since you're likely going to be in line for more than enough time to read the menu. With that in mind, I wasn't at all bothered by the pace of my dining experience.I ordered some prosecco and my meal, that was it! The waitress was a little curt -- for example I asked about sauce options and rather than saying \"Oh, they're explained on the back of the menu,\" she just flipped the menu over in front of me and walked off. Maybe it's a Boston thing? I thought she was having a bad day, but later she was very friendly. Who knows! Not great, but not the end of the world either. My only gripe was that as a lone diner, I couldn't eat more things! In fact, I had just enjoyed a late lunch at another excellent restaurant, but was determined to eat at Giacomo's before the end of my trip, so I struggled to make room for my dish alone. Had I come hungry, though, it would have been tempting to order food for three. Portions are generous, prices are super reasonable.I really can't say enough, just make sure you go.

Luckily, we were part of the first group seated (February is f'ing freezing in Boston)! We loved every second of our entire experience! The bottle of wine was a steal and we made friends with our 'neighbors' who were regulars at the place. We started with the Burrata Mozzerella on the specials menu. I got the Butternut Squash Ravioli and spouse got the Veal Parmigiana. He asked the server about it and she gave the 'ok' sign and said it was WICKED TENDA, WICKED JUICY!

It is worth every penny you spend there, and it's not even that expensive. Some things that are extremely good are the Lobster Raviolis and the Butternut Squash Ravioli. These are two of their most popular dishes so I would HIGHLY recommend at least trying it out on your first time at the restaurant. \u00a0But keep in mind, the raviolis are usually a smaller entree, but the cream sauces can get a little overwhelming so the smaller portion usually makes sense. This place is known for their homemade pasta, so make sure to get it no matter what! The calamari and caprese is always good as well.In terms of service, DO NOT EXPECT HIGH QUALITY SERVICE. This does not mean that Giacomo's has horrible waiters (at least not all the time). People give this place 4-5 stars because of the food, not because of the service, why? It's because the food is THAT good that the restaurant doesn't need to be as concerned with high quality service because people WILL be coming in no matter what. Here are some tips to help prepare you for the next time you come into Giacomo's- There WILL be a wait, unless your lucky. However, if you're a larger group, you might have to wait longer because they're trying to rush out the smaller tables. But in the end, the wait will be worth it.- Be prepared with what you're going to order. The menu is outside so have it figured out, the only thing that might surprise you walking in are the specials but try to decide asap.- DON'T GO HERE ON A FIRST DATE. Um, isn't it awkward having to wait online with your date for 2+ hours and then go inside to kinda actually start your date? Yeah, I would recommend coming back when you guys are a little more comfortable with one another.- Bring cash, there's pretty much no restaurant in the North End that takes cash so be prepared.

I scooted all the way in, up to my plate, in anticipation of her passing behind my chair. I am a small/medium sized woman. She could not pass and asked me to scoot in after she began her attempt. I could not so she had to ask the woman whose chair's back was behind mine, to scoot in. The moderately large woman's behind smashed itself up against my back/chair as she passed.

There is almost always a line outside Giacomo with the smell of garlic wafting through the air tempting the tourists or bystander to join the hour and 20 minute wait. The seating inside allows at most 40 people at a time, if that, very similar to the Daily Catch. And despite the hype, we would both rate it as \"ok\". FOOD: We ordered the garlic bread, Fettuccini with chicken, peppers and onions in a tomato cream sauce and the Ziti with chicken and broccoli in garlic cream sauce. All better than Olive Garden most definitely, except the garlic bread. They pour olive oil and a layer of minced garlic on top of bread. The entrees were good.ATMOSPHERE: You may end of sitting at a 'community' style table in Boston, which is a separate table from the couple or family next to you, but you could reach over and grab anything off of their table you are so close OR you could sit by the window and have hungry tourists eyeing you constantly to watch how quickly you are eating so they can get inside to eat after you are finished. So, pry not the best place for a first date, unless you don't want to hear what your date is saying and may prefer to shout with the other strangers at your table. SERVICE: I'd recommend that you study that menu while you are outside in line because they would like to know what you want when you get in. And you will definitely need to speak loudly (picture Christmas dinner with a group of forty sitting in the kitchen).

This is one of those cases. I was on a business trip to Boston this weekend and saw that this place had a ton of positive ratings so decided to check it out with a friend. My family runs Italian restaurants, so I have a VERY keen eye for what should and should not be on the menu, type of service and etc. I was really excited to try Boston Italian as I have never had it, and really wanted an awesome experience.... I didn't get this here. Let's start with the menu choices:Most of the selection is very basic dishes, heavy Boston influence, and heavy on the seafood. After once glance at the menu, and looking at what people were eating at the tiny tables I didn't think I was going to be in for anything amazing. Customer Service: The sad part is after waiting for 2 hours to eat, we were talked to rudely... shoved out of the way when we were trying to come in to order and told to get out. We placed our order to go, as we needed to get to an important business meeting as waiting in line had taken too much time. We were informed the place was cash only ( would help to have this posted on the door for people not from Boston) and went to get cash. My friend and I decided to just to try another restaurant as this seemed like a massive hassle, and the food didn't look/smell worth it. SO GLAD we ended up trying another location as we had a MUCH better experience at La Famiglia Giorgio's which is around the corner. They were friendly, the veal was AMAZING as it was cooked perfectly and the selection of sauces, pastas and fresh food was just to die for.

First off, I'm from Texas and visited Giacomo's in September of 2013. My boss recommended the place with the warning that we'd probably have to wait but it's so worth it that even our VP will wait in line. He was absolutely right!Two of my friends and I got there around 7 and waited in a line of about 12 people. Dinner here was on the \"to do\" list for Boston so we weren't going to give up on waiting. We met a really nice couple that were standing in line in front of us. They are locals and regulars at Giacomo's. Talking to them made waiting in line much more bearable. We probably waited for a little over and hour before we were seated. So when you first see the menu, it looks a little plain. Don't let this deter you! We got the calamari first and it was perfectly fried. Not too oily and very lightly battered in a good way. I got the shrimp and scallop linguine with the Giacomo's sauce. The pasta was almost a little too al dente for me but over the course of the meal, I got over it and really ended up liking it. The plate was so big but I couldn't stop eating it and, before I knew it, I was done!You can really tell that the waitresses here are accustomed to the rush and know how to work in a very efficient manner. It makes it so that the service doesn't seem to be as much of an issue like at other places.SUPER TIP:Don't come here by yourself if you really want to be by yourself. A couple in front of my friends and I in line were very observant and noticed that two people that were previously standing in line were seated together but didn't seem to know each other when they were standing in line. The couple were regulars so they said would ask the lady that sat the people at the table about it. The most awesome part: the waitress, Rose, said that she does it often for single people that come to fill tables. She said she hopes that people she pairs up will one say get together.

People passing by stared, laughed, and mocked. It was cold and threatening to rain. But we continued to wait for nearly 2 hours, rocking back and forth on our feet, draining the power on our phones, and sending each other to scout out other nearby places for the occasional snack (such as cannolis from Mike's one block away).2 hours later though, and we were in. And it was WORTH it! We were seated quickly and handed our menus, but with 2 hours to make my menu choices, I already knew what we wanted, save for the menu specials on the left wall that I hadn't seen from outside.Fresh burrata with tomatoes to begin (I never, ever say no to burrata - who can?). The calamari (\"SMALL CAL!\") with mildly spicy pickled peperoncinis and spicy tomato sauce. House special for two, obviously.The burrata was extremely fresh, and of all the burrata I've eaten, it ranks pretty high up there. Burrata is made from mozzarella and cream, so it has both that pliable cheesiness and rich creaminess that is so yummy. It was refreshing with the slices of tomato that it was served with.The calamari was unlike any calamari I've had before; I've never had it with peperoncinis before and now I will probably wish that all of them are supposed to include them. The batter was very seasoned and the tomato sauce was spicy - a must-order!Now, onto the house special. Our tablemates had chosen the ravioli and some kind of spicy pasta, which were both fairly generic choices. I'll bet they were tasty as well, but nevertheless, our tablemates had HUGE menu jealousy when our house special platter holding two lobsters, clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and a pile of pasta in spicy lobster sauce was set down.Is it weird that the action of the platter being set down on the table has been on loop in my head for the last few weeks? It was seriously the biggest plate of food I've ever had (esp. for two people only) at a restaurant and I've never had so much fresh seafood.I mean, I've had king crab legs in Las Vegas and garlic-scallion crab in LA, but this is a whole different level of seafood, particularly for the price. At $55 for the house special for two, this is so much cheaper than what it would probably cost in LA -- $55 would probably just get you a single serving with 1/6th of the clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops, and a few chunks of lobster on a bit of pasta. NOT all of this for two people.It was as delicious as it looked, and I am so very glad we stuck out the 2 hours to wait. If you are waiting in line and reading this, don't lose hope!

Prior to last night, I held the restaurant in high regard & frequently recommended the place to others, but after my horrendous dining experience yesterday evening, I hold it in rather low regard & will cease recommending it as a place to eat in Boston.My unpleasant dining experience began almost immediately after my friends & I were seated at our table. We had waited in line for 40 minutes & were one of the first people to be seated at 4:30. We were seated in the back of the restaurant against the wall with the menu written on it, & I took the seat right next to the wall. As I was up against the wall with the menu, I could not easily read the menu from my seat, so I stood up to quickly look over it. I had been standing for a grand total of 2 seconds, if that, when one of the waitresses ordered me in an irritated tone to \"sit down\", because I was \"blocking everyone's view.\" She said this while simultaneously pointing to my chair. After barking at me to sit down, she handed everyone at the table a menu, noting that everything that was on the wall menu was also on this paper menu. As I looked around the restaurant, I noticed that every other customer had also received a paper menu, which begs the question, if everyone had already received a paper menu, why would it have mattered if I was \"blocking\" the menu on the wall?Although thoroughly annoyed, I decided stay, as I had been looking forward to eating at Giacomo's all day. We ordered calamari for the table, which we enjoyed. For my entree, I ordered the scallops served over linguine in a scampi sauce, which was extremely disappointing. The scampi sauce was bland, & the scallops were chewy from having been overcooked. To add insult to injury, we were the last table from our seating to be served - by the time we received our dishes, everyone else from the 4:30 seating had already left or was in the process of paying.I left feeling very disappointed, but unbeknownst to me, that was not the end of my awful dining experience. Giacomo's had one more surprise in store for me: food poisoning. I am unsure whether the calamari or scallops caused the food poisoning, but I spent the remainder of the evening nauseous & feeling absolutely miserable.

I've experienced American style Italian food there, and NYC, and North Beach SF and - and if I'm honest with myself this may have been the best of this type of food I've ever had outside of my father's kitchen.Arrived at about 5:45 on a warm but slightly damp Thursday to catch a bite before a concert at the Garden (yay for Boston walk-ability.)

The food is delicious and affordable. Every entre on the menu is below $20, the appetizers are like around $10, a glass of wine is $5, and the bottles are $18. You can't beat that.The menu options also are straightforward and classic Italian (calamari, mozarella tomato salad, chicken parmesan, ravioli, ziti, frutti de mar, and simply-prepared fish dishes). They are prepared exactly the way you would expect, but somehow they taste better than any other version of that dish that you've ever had. I had the Chicken Parmesan, and it was simple but incredible, probably because the ingredients \u00a0like the pasta and tomato sauce are super fresh and prepared from scratch on site. One thing you have to be prepared for is the fast-pacedness of your meal (they are turning tables really fast to help move the line) and the bare-bones atmosphere. I assume that they can afford to make the food so inexpensive because the restaurant is saving a lot of money on other features. For example, the restaurant is really small with a small staff and has litterally no special atmosphere or interior decoration. The food is served on plain white ceramic plates along with paper napkins. Also, its cash only, so the restaurant can avoid the credit card company fees.

The cheese is just too good, nice and creamy. The lobster ravioli is a must, with a light, refined tomato sauce and fresh-fresh-fresh lobster. Just a little salty and a tad sweet, The sauce doesn't overpower the lobster and the pasta is definitely homemade. I dream about the lobster ravioli here. The butternut squash tortellini is my backup. It's so well made and the butternut squash is a great balance of sweetness and salt.

There wasn't much talking once the enormous platter of linguine with lobster, clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp, and scallops was placed down, and we went to work.PROS- The fried calamari was delicious: not too fried, seasoned well, and fresh (as far as you can tell from fried stuff)- In truth, the red Giacomo sauce really made the entire dish extraordinary: I'm not sure what they put in it, but I would buy bottles of it to transform my home cooking. Creamy, tomato-based, plenty of seasoning, great consistency. At the end of our dish, we asked for more bread just to mop up the remaining sauce- Zuppa di Pesce was as desired: lots of fresh seafood on top of linguine. The lobster is already split for you, so you just need to crack open the claws. Yum! The variety of seafood was quite astounding and a phenomenal deal.- The bread was simple but high-quality, allowing it to serve as a base on which you could add whatever you wanted (mostly sauce for us haha)- The staff was courteous, efficient, and professional. This is clearly a place where they try to get you in and out as quickly as possible while allowing you to enjoy your restaurant experience.CONS- I'm not a huge fan of long lines, and it was snowing the day we went. Bleh for the 35 minute wait. The line moves fast though, so if you have only one person waiting, make sure the rest of the party is close by. Larger groups will wait much longer than a 2-person group.- Along those lines, no reservations. :(- Other reviewers describe the Zuppa di Pesce as more than enough for 3-4 people. While it is a lot of food, my boyfriend and I had enough room afterwards to saunter down the street to Mike's Pastry for some dessert. I suspect they might have cut down on the amount of linguine given since our pasta portion was relatively small. I got 3-4 fork-spinfuls of linguine, and I think my boyfriend got 5-6 spinfuls, which is decent but not enough to feed a small nation the way others have described it.- Cash only.

I only had a day in Boston, so I didn't want to leave thinking I should have just waited in line.Here's some things I wish I had known while I was waiting in line. Hopefully it will ease you're mind while you wait:I got there at about 20:50 (8:50 PM), and the line was backed up about eight parties in front of us.- There are about ten tables that seat about four people as well as a couple seats at the bar. I think your best chance of getting a table quickly is with a party of four or less.- You don't need to put your name down. The waiters and waitresses will come out and see how many are in your party to assess how they will get you in- We were told that upon arrival, we had an hour to an hour and a half wait. We got in at about twenty to thirty minutes- We were also told that if we didn't get in by 21:30 (9:30 PM), we wouldn't get to eat today. However, we left at 22:07 (10:07 PM), and they were still letting people come in to eat. Still, this could be a nice day, so I do suggest getting there early.Inside:Like I said, there's only about ten tables, so you imagine that things are tight. Don't be surprised if you're sharing a table with another group. There's a lot of hustle and bustle, but it's all a part of the process.Service:I thought service was great. You order right when you get in, the food comes out hot and quickly, your drinks are always filled, and the waiters and waitresses are pretty entertaining. If you feel like you're being rushed, think about the poor souls that are outside waiting to be as happy as you are! I did my best to get in and out while still getting the full experience.Food:- Calamari. Best I've ever had. This is a must! Super tender. Not rubbery. The breading doesn't separate from the squid and isn't gritty. The especially liked that they fried some peppers and through it in with the squid.- Mussels in Giacomo sauce. First off, if you're like me, you always butcher Italian dish names. The restaurant and the sauce is pronounced gee-ack-ko-mo. Alright, the mussels combined with the Giacomo sauce combined with a little bread for dipping... Awesome! The sauce just melts in your mouth, and the mussels taste so fresh.- 1/2 Lobster, Clams, and Mussels over Linguini in Giacomo Sauce. Usually when I go Italian, I like to get the Frutti di Mare. Though this was an option, I couldn't say no to the 1/2 lobster option for a dollar more. The one thing that made me hesitant at first was that I wouldn't get scallops, but when I got my dish, there was a single scallop on my plate for me to get my fix. Hahaha. The plate is no joke. Nothing on the plate is lacking. You get enough of everything. The lobster was sweet and consisted of head, tail, and claw. The linguini was cooked very well, and the plate is piping hot. It didn't take me long to clean my plate. I did leave the claw at first because it's not usually my thing, but the waiter came out and told me that I need to finish, so I complied.

Thankfully the line wasn't too long and was moving at a constant pace. When we finally got in, I understood why. I think we waited in line about 30 minutes before having a table for four open up. Typically I don't like to wait in lines, but the smell of the savory Italian food that wafted everytime someone opened the door piqued my interest and made my stomach rumble even more. So that's what kept me in line.When a table opened up, we were shuffled in briskly by the no-nonsense hostess/waitress/part-owner of the restaurant. She's the type to hold a poker face, yet turned out to be the sweetest lady ever. We had about 1 minute to review the menu before we were asked to order. I felt the pressure. Even though this was a sit-down restaurant, it was more like \"fast-food, sit down and eat as fast as you can to make room for the dozens of others standing outside in line and waiting for a table to open up\". \u00a0I chose to get the salmon in lobster sauce fettucine dish, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Our food came promptly and was delicious as ever. I liked that we could actually see our food being made (and probably not by choice, but just because the restaurant was super small).

With the glowing reviews on Yelp, I was honestly expecting a nice dining experience, yet we received the complete opposite.

First, we waited about 30-45min to get into the restaurant, which would have been fine if we were treated with some respect once we got inside.

The issue was that a group was leaving and blocking our path, yet \u00a0we continued to get barked at.

It gives me more of a family-run feel and I think it helps speed up the process (think about groups who split up checks three or four ways...)The main problem, as everyone has mentioned, is the line. Once you make it close enough to see inside the restaurant you're still looking at between 30 and 40 minutes of a wait, assuming you have four or less people in your party. For those who are driving, this isn't so bad since that's about the amount of time it will take you to find a parking spot (yes, really) so leave one or two people in line while you do that and you should make it in at about the same time. I saw a couple bring a cocktail to share while they waited last time I was there, and it seemed to help them endure the line.There is also the issue of seating.

I tried replicating the sauce at home, but I couldn't capture the full flavor profile that made this meal so memorable. \u00a0Not super heavy, considering the creamy and richness of it all. One of the most well-rounded and balanced pasta sauces I've had.We also ordered and enjoyed a veal parmigiana. Not too soggy or greasy and topped with the wonderful marinara sauce we so enjoyed. \u00a0AND our server was so kind and sweet. \u00a0I'm sure she's seen people from all over come through her tables, but she was still excited to hear where we were from and why we were visiting.

As with the general consensus of the other reviews, the overall experience felt a bit rushed. The service was ok but sensed some disinterest and even arrogance. I got the homemade fussili with lobster, shrimp and giacomo sauce. The sauce was nice, fresh and flavorsome, but the pasta was severely undercooked. Normally I wouldn't mind if it was a bit firmer than al dente as I'm not usually one to make a fuss, but this was hard. Bordering on raw. I proceeded to inform the waiter quite reluctantly that it was undercooked (which is something I've never done), and straight away he retorted with a defensive and derogatory tone, that this was how they do it here and that's what al dente was. Wait, what? Al dente is al dente, there's no degrees of al dente. It either is or it isn't. So this really annoyed and irked me, as I myself am Italian with parents born in Italy, and I've been eating pasta for 26 years - I think I know what al dente is, and I know for a fact that that pasta was nowhere near. Period. But anyway, he offered to take it back and cook it a bit more which I gladly accepted and thanked him for, and it returned fairly promptly and a lot better (but still on the firm side). But overall the situation left me feeling a bit uneasy and quite frankly belittled. FYI, I tried my girlfriend's tortellini and that was nice, and the calamari entree was pretty good.

Your server will explain the menu as some of the pasta dishes come with your choice of three house made sauces. We needed some time and ordered a few appetizers.1. Deep fried mozzarella. This is not your TGI Friday's version. This is actually pretty well executed. The cheese is fried to perfection and tastes phenomenal. The red sauce is mind blowing and was so good we kept it for dipping later.2. Garlic bread. Sounds boring right? It wasn't. It's garlic bread done right, with a slight burnt edge and just the right amount of butter to garlic ratio. ORDER IT!3. Fried calamari. Not my thing, but everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy it.For my entree, I went with the gnocchi special which was served in a red sauce, along with pancetta and a few other things that for the moment is slipping my mind. I am a fan of al dente pasta and was happy that this Giacomo's is too. My gnocchi was perfect, I enjoyed every last bite.The wine list is small, but has enough to keep you interested and included some nice Italian and domestic selections and very little mark up.

About 10 minutes before opening (5pm), someone came out to take down names and the number of people per party. When the doors opened at 5pm, my friend and I managed to be the last party able to sneak in right away...considering it was only the two of us. We got the last table of that first round/group of people to walk in the door. Yay!We were seated and immediately noticed how small the restaurant actually IS. It's small, yes, but with a friendly atmosphere. While the activity level and service in the restaurant seemed pretty fast, my friend and I ordered calamari...then had to order it from the same woman again because it never came from the kitchen after that first order. Once we HAD the calamari though, as well as each of our entrees, we realized how delicious the food really is. Perhaps it's not the most amazing calamari ever, especially having traveled and taste tested different calamari from all over, but it's certainly some of the best I've had in a long time. The portions are large and the price for anything is surprisingly minimal. We didn't feel rushed at all either.All in all, a generally good time...besides the wait times for our food. To reinforce the \"cash only\" policy though, yes...definitely remember to bring cash. A couple across the room either forgot it was cash only or didn't know about it, so the husband had to run to the bank and withdraw some.

I have lived in Boston for most of life, and I frequent the North End, but I have always avoided this place due to the long lines. We arrived on a very snowy Friday night, hoping to miss some of the lines. We were partially correct - there were about three parties ahead of us, so we waited about 15 minutes. From what I have seen of these lines before, that was nothing compared to other Friday nights. The setting is typical North End - Tables so close together you can barely move and you better make friends with those sitting next to you since you will basically have dinner with them, too. No problem, I love the North End and was expecting no less! Our waitress came over and was fantastic - helpful, funny, and direct to the point. I could tell there would be no dilly-dallying in this place. We ordered wine ($17 bottle? Yes please!) and an appetizer of calamari. The app came out so quickly I swear the must have known we were coming. It was tasty but not the best. Then comes the main course. I ordered a shrimp and scallop dish with the house sauce. First, the pasta was boxed spaghetti. I have nothing against boxed pasta, but in the North End I at least expect the option to have handmade pasta. Perhaps I could have ordered it? I am not sure because I was never given a choice. The sauce was very good, but not out-of-control-amazing as I would have hoped it was. The scallops were small and the shrimp was a bit overcooked. Wait.... wasn't this supposed to be the most amazing Italian food I have ever had? Unfortunately, it wasn't.

Easily, hands-down, one of the best Italian food I've ever had. The food is utterly fantastic. Super tight seating and long, long, long wait. After eating any of their authentic dish, you would be speechless after your first bite. Totally worth it! The pumpkin tortellini simply exquisite. Soft mascarpone cheese in the center but balanced round with nice round flavor of pumpkin. Didn't think delicate yet full of flavor could happen in one spoonful, but this is it. Many of their dishes, like their house sauce, was meat or fish based, so there's plenty choices. As a vegetarian, the choice to eat the pumpkin tortellini was an easy choice, and did not make me feel left out of the food action. Taste was perfect and portions were just right.Definitely builds up the anticipation when you see the open kitchen and the chefs bustling about. The service doesn't hover. The waitress gets your order quickly, and let the party chat while checking in once a while. She's always host and the waitress there when we go. Appreciated that she is a no-bullshit kinda gal. All the orders and daily special are written in beautiful cursive by her so she knows what's best. Try not to take her slight sarcasm as insults.It's a small place, but it certainly has it's charm. A bit loud but I think is a good date spot because of the good food, but you will be waiting in line for what seems like forever. I think they move to fill the larger parties sooner, so they can move the customers in and out.

The fried peppers in there are perfect. The sauce is killer. I didn't want this to end, but I had to leave room for my main course: off the specials menu: linguini with 1/2 lobster, mussels & clams. I chose the Fri Diavola sauce - red sauce with a hint of some spice. AWESOME. The food was phenomenal. The pasta was perfect, the sauce was a home run, the seafood was ...amazing.

It was fresh and really creamy gooey cheese in the middle of the cheese ball. The tomatoes were so flavorful. We ordered more bread so we could eat it, but it tastes good just on its own.Butternut Squash Ravioli - This was definitely worth the hype, but not in terms of quantity. There were only 8 ravioli..which is standard, I think, when you order legit ravioli from an italian resto. There usually isn't too much. It was a creamy sauce that was a little bit sweet which complemented the savory ravioli filling. Noms, I definitely liked it and was perfect for me because I wasn't that hungry.Lemon Fettuccine - I actually didn't like this dish that much. It had scallops that were really yummy, but after two bites, I was getting too much for the lemon zest. It was really making it difficult to taste the pasta without little bitter pieces of lemon getting in the way...Chocolate Bomb - OMFG. This was really good!! It was a chocolate brownie topped with ganache and SPRINKLES..and served with a whipped cream perimeter. It was really rich and decadent, so if you're too full from the meal and want something light, this probably isn't the best idea.

The calamari's lightly breaded so it didn't have that weird fried gunk bad calamari always gets. Still, it was refreshingly crunchy and completely addicting.

Now, I don't really care for clams & mussels, but the thought of lobster was overwhelming. Requesting the pesto sauce and thinking I could hand the shellfish onto someone else while I reveled in lobster & pasta, I was set. But when it came, I just had to try a clam. I did, and it was like none other I had tasted - I actually liked it. So I ended up eating up almost the entire meal, which was ginormous. (Of course, I had to share the goodness with the family).

My buddy had a special which was a half pound lobster, clams & mussels over linguine with fra diavolo sauce ($18.95) and I had the Frutti DiMare ($17.95) which was mussels, clams, calamari, scallops, & shrimp with Giacomo sauce (cream & tomato) over linguine, both were very good and tasty.

This year I turned 30. I went to dinner with a bunch of friends, but some of my work folk couldn't make it. One of those work friends has been saying all along that we should go out again to \"celebrate\" and so it was that I came to be having my 2nd 30th birthday dinner at Giacomo's nearly 7 months after my actual birthday.I had heard a lot about Giacomo's, but had never been. I heard the food was good, that there was always a line out front. For some reason I was envisioning something a little more fancy, and definitely something bigger. We showed up, and yes, there was a line, but we got there just as the first \u00a0seating of diners were finishing up, so our wait wasn't that long. I was surprised at how small this place is, but I like the intimate feel. After seeing the size of the place, the line out front make a little more sense. Our party of 5 was seated, and the waitress came over. She worked with purposefulness. She was matter-of-fact, and friendly, and moved with the efficiency of someone who's been working there for decades. Specials are up on the wall, oh, and here they are handwritten and laminated as well. That's a detail that made me smile.The food comes, and after tasting not only my own dish, but others, the line outside makes even more sense. My butternut squash ravioli were amazing. I even tried the fried calamari appetizer, and up until that point, I always commented that eating fried calamari was like eating rubber bands. That's not the case here. Apparently I had just never had good calamari.This little place is cash only, though when you're the \"birthday\" girl , no cash is necessary. Not when you have friends like mine.

Never wanting to wait on the super long line I was able to catch the restaurant on a rainy day when the wait was shorter. I waited about 30 minutes on a Tuesday night at 6pm. The decor inside is intimate and well suited for a date or small party. Once seated the waitress immediately asked for our order which was attentive and nice. However, once the entree was ordered and the food came out I felt very rushed. The waiters came over to my table twice to take the plates before I was done eating. I had leftover sauce from my pasta (lobster ravioli - which was wonderful) but - the waiter took away my plate before I had a chance to ask for more bread. Overall - The food was great. The prices were awesome. On the down side, I felt like my meal was completely rushed and I came home and ate two cookies because I could not stuff myself the way I usually do at an Italian dinner with lots of bread and sauces at the end of the meal.

Ok, Giacomo's isn't personally responsible, in fact I never ate anywhere nearly as good.* BUT traveling means eating out a lot and trying to scout out gems. Giacomo's was the second half of my North End do-over. Last visit, I didn't plan accordingly and was gobsmacked by the huge line for a table. I highly recommend trying to dine here earlier on a weeknight; on a Monday the throngs of tourists were noticeably absent and the wait for a table was only about 10 minutes. Giacomo's reminds me of a cross between two of my favorite Italian places back home; one a no-frills cash-only place with a chalkboard menu that specializes in the Italian staples, the other a tiny little space with amazing food and a selection of more creative dishes. Personally, I would not recommend this place for a group of larger than 4-6 people. There are maybe 10 tables and everything is close quarters; the chef's table (for 2) is even wedged in corner at the bar. I also think you'll be disappointed if you come here for a romantic date or long lingering meal; they're always busy and turn the tables quite fast. I was in and out in no more than 40 minutes. My server reminded me a lot of my late aunt; a no nonsense little Italian firecracker. Any question I asked her, she answered quickly and definitively like no other option existed. Fortunately, she didn't steer me wrong once. If you go in expecting your server to provide small talk and pleasantries, you may find the service curt or cold; not being one for idle chit chat, I liked it. For a place that's so busy, service is fast, efficient and attentive; everything runs like a well-oiled machine. In hindsight, my only misstep was ordering the house salad; compared to the other starter options available, this is skippable. The dressing was good, but the big hunks of iceberg killed it for me. On the upside, the bread was quite good and useful for sopping some of the house dressing up off my plate. For my meal, I ordered the linguine with mussels and clams in the Giacomo sauce, a lobster-based tomato sauce with a touch of bechamel. My meal was fabulous, I was so glad I was steered toward the Giacomo sauce over the fra diavolo. I received a mountain of linguine with a healthy portion of mussels and clams. Since I didn't have a way to store or reheat leftovers, I cleaned my plate; though there was a genuine concern that I might pop a button or bust a zipper - it totally would have been worth it. Giacomo's offers not only great food, but great value for the money. My tab was $25 for a glass of wine, salad and entree. The next time I'm back in Boston, this is on my short list of places I need to return. *That's what happens when your job regularly sends you to hotspots like Fort Wayne, IN.

I wish that they asked us politely or put a sign written \"please do not standing in front of the door even it's snowing or raining, thank you\" instead of yelled at their costumers.

We were already full at that time but but because of the 500+ review with 4.5 stars, we decided to go here, get one order of food, one glass of wine and shared it for both of us. The lady who took our order raised her voice and said \"what do you want to eat for your dinner?\" so I said we will share.Obviously, I was not very happy about the service. Our bill came out to be $24.8. If I were very mean, I would not give any tips but we decided give $5 tip which is a little bit more than 15% for a very bad service. I heard the lady who served us said \"look at this (referred to the cash that we gave her and shake her head)\"The pasta was ok.

I don't want you to be disappointed as we did last time.From wikipedia (TIP/gratuity)A tip (also called a gratuity) is a voluntary extra payment made to certain service sector workers in addition to the advertised price of the transaction. Such payments and their size are a matter of social custom. In countries where tipping is expected (the United States for example), complicated unofficial standards and customs have developed over the exact percentage to tip, and what should and should not be included in this calculation. In other cultures where tipping exists it is more flexible and no specific assumptions of the tip amount exist.Some believe the custom of tipping helps to improve service, as workers may receive higher tips from satisfied customers. In the United States, some employers pay workers with the expectation that tips will make up the difference. The practice of tipping is controversial, with numerous criticisms. Some have criticized the inherent \"social awkwardness\" in transactions that involve tipping, the inconsistency of tipping for some services but not similar ones, and the irrationality of basing tips on price, rather than the amount and quality of service.", "Date": "2010-12-22", "Author_Location": "Berkeley, CA"}, {"Author": "Liz D.", "ReviewID": "dJgliDkPXe26LgaI5axCeA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let's start with the good part: The pasta is very good.

When we discussed it, the woman at the table next to us leaned over and said, \"It's delicious,\" pointing to her plate. I don't even like butternut squash all that much, but this dish was amazing. Slightly sweet, not to cheesy or salty, but just the right balance of everything - tastes, textures, etc. We also ordered the veal marsala with came with a side of spaghetti with marinara sauce. This was great, but not as good as the ravioli. It was extremely flavorful, and they didn't skip on that rich, unique marsala wine taste. We ordered it because it was only a dollar more than the chicken marsala, and we thought, \"When is veal ever this cheap?\" The veal was very tender and we liked this dish a lot.Another really fantastic thing about Giacomo's is the camaraderie you feel with all the people waiting in line with you but especially with the people you're dining with because the place is really that small. People had to move their chairs every time someone wanted to get by, elbows were hitting strangers' elbows and servers had to reach over diners to get food on the table.

Even though me and my friends came on a random Thursday, it was NO exception.. and we endured a good 30-40 min before being seated. Basically Giacomo's specialty is in pasta and seafood. The menu gives you the freedom of choosing the fish, noodles, and sauce that can be altered to your liking. I ordered the \"Swordfish and Tuna Pieces in a Pesto Cream Sauce\" ($15) - except I switched out the pesto sauce with red tomato sauce. My dish was SO disappointing. Noodle to fish ratio was too big - not enough fish!! AND my fish was dry.. (I know sword fish is a dry fish.. but nonetheless.. it was dry). And everything was SO bland. I used my salt shaker with EVERY bite. That's pretty sad! Might have been due to the LACK of sauce on the dish. I was presented with a big pile of noodles for dinner :( My friend ordered the \"Salmon and Sundried Tomatoes in a Tomato Cream Sauce\" ($15) - pretty much the same problem. Way too much noodles, not enough sauce, and too bland. We put the salt shaker between us and shared in between bites. My Bostonian friend did a little better when he ordered the Frutti Di Mare ($19). This had a nice variety of seafood including shrimp, scallops, calamari, and mussels. However, he also got the red tomato sauce and suffered the blandness :( One big mistake we all made that night was that we ordered the regular red tomato sauce instead of the spicy red (diavolo) sauce. We all suffered the BLANDNESS! Plus I really dislike the cramped environment and the way the waiters really try to turn the tables by pushing service. We were rushed to order then some of our plates were taken away before we really finished. But both my friends told me that Giacamo's is usually VERY good and today must have just been a off night.

I am certainly not the first to make this statement, but I'll say it anyway. I took my family, who were visiting from western Pennsylvania, and my boyfriend here this past weekend. Our group included myself, my sister and mom, who are always up for trying something new, and my dad and my man, neither of whom like the city or like waiting and would really rather just stick to what they know and love. Our wait was about 40 minutes on a busy Saturday night (near impossible for the mensfolk). We were fortunate that we had such a lovely weather evening while outside, however I will mention that the line was formed right along a sewage grate.....pew! Once inside I think the boys' tensions eased up considerably with the amazing food smells. The cozy 10-table atmosphere contributed to our close family outing....very casual, borderline noisy (which was totally our thing, being loud part-Italians ourselves). Our waiter was a local Bostonian, complete with Southie drawl and macho funny guy demeanor. He was quick and efficient but provided awesome, thorough service and kept us laughing throughout the whole meal. Now food....We started with a large order of calamari, which is lightly breaded and fried with hot pepper rings, was the most tender and delicious calamari I've ever had! My mom usually swears off calamari because of what it does to her stomach, but couldn't help herself with Giacomo's appetizer. The large order was perfect for our party of 5 as a little tide-me-over. It came while we were still deliberating over the menu which helped ease our grumbling bellies and unsure minds (like many other reviewers said, it was so hard to pick just one meal for each of us!) We ordered 1) clams and mussels fra diavlo, a perfectly spicy marinara (the heat can be customized) with super fresh shellfish over nice firm linguini noodles, 2) two orders of shrimp and scallops with Giacomo sauce, a light lobster and tomato cream sauce that was neither too heavy or too wimpy, also over linguini, 3) veal marsala, super tender meat , not too heavily breaded with proscuitto and the most fragrant and delicious marsala sauce (served with linguini marinara on the side), and 4) lobster ravioli, the perfect sized portion with an amazingly light garlic and (really fragrant!) basil cream sauce. There's nothing any of us would have changed about our entrees The flavors were perfect and there was plenty for each of us to share. My dad, who came into the restaurant wanting lame-o spaghetti and meatballs (which Giacomo's doesn't make regularly) so as not to be difficult, was blown away by the food, saying he'd never tasted Italian food like this before. He also didn't complain about the prices, and this man ALWAYS complains about restaurant prices, especially in Boston. My mom, who is full Italian, said she hadn't tasted food this delicious since before her nanna passed away. And my boyfriend, who can be a picky brat of an eater and who also won't usually put a bite of seafood in his mouth, sampled all of the entrees and said there wasn't anything he wouldn't want to gorge on. My sister and I, the least picky of the group, of course loved every bit of it, including the crowded sidewalks getting to the restaurant, and we weren't even too bothered by the sewage grate or the wait outside. All in all, a kick-ass place. Well worth the wait. I'll be back, even if it's by myself!", "Date": "2008-08-12", "Author_Location": "Medford, MA"}, {"Author": "Danielle A.", "ReviewID": "UfZW1ntIZCGdDBtGizv5TA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying this: If you hate waiting to get in somewhere to eat, if you have severe food allergies,refuse to carry cash, or if you absolutely despise small, crowded spaces no matter what and in all circumstances - Giacomo's is not for you. Having said that, our experience tonight at Giacomo's was - in true Bostonese - freakin' awesome.We arrived at about 5:00-5:15 or so and got in line. We knew from reading the Yelp reviews and having walked by several times in the past that this was normal, and we ended up waiting until about 6:30 before we were seated. The restaurant itself only seats maybe 20-30 people in a very cramped area. Normally this would have lost points with me, but truthfully it ended up lending to the charm. Because of the open kitchen set-up and the casual attitude of the staff (our waiter - Tony - asked us \"What do you kids want for supper?\" when he took our order), it almost feels like you're at your aunt or grandmother's house for dinner. I come from a large family, so this did not phase me at all; it felt almost relaxed and normal to be in that atmosphere. The menu is simple - appetizers, entrees, a simple wine list, one beer (right now they're serving Sam Adams Summer), and some soft drinks. No dessert - but truthfully with all the Italian pastry options in the North end, it's not necessary. Besides - once you eat at Giacomo's, you'll understand why they do not have dessert. They KNOW they have a line outside, and dessert/coffee only makes people loiter. I've never seen any restaurant turn over a table as quickly as they do after people clear out to get the next people in. Never mind the fact that your food comes out pronto - hot, quick, and delicious. It's almost like a fancy Italian dinner diner in terms of speed & service from the staff.Anyways - the food. The freaking food. It was amazing overall. To start, we ordered the fried calamari because the Yelp reviews raved about it. The calamari is served with a side of red sauces and some fried/battered peppers (jalapenos?) mixed in. Our order of friend calamari had minimal tentacles and was slightly overcooked (but not too rubbery) which was awesome for me because I like my calamari slightly overcooked and HATE the tentacles. The sauces was hot and it was a perfect compliment to the calamari. I would say it was *good* calamari, but truthfully I worry the Yelp reviews are overhyping it. \u00a0Then it was on to the entrees. My husband ordered their Fruiti de Mare with the Giacomo house sauce and I partook in one of their specials: Gnocchi stuffed with roasted red pepper & goat chese cooked with chicken, mushrooms & basil in a tomato marscarpone sauce. I can't speak to my husband's dish (but you can read his review - he's Steve A.) but I will say that mine was phenomenal. The sauce was absolutely to die for; the sweetness of the marscarpone is a great balance to the tomatoes. The gnocchi was about perfect and unlike some restaurants I've been to - they did not skimp on it at all. Too often I've seen restaurants skimp on the gnocchi when they serve it up with other things mixed in with it. There was a good amount of basil without overpowering the dish, and the flavors were just out of this world. Side note - they do offer bread with what tasted like a high-end olive oil on the table. The bread itself is your average crusty bread. One other tip (and why I say this is not for those with severe food allergies): There didn't seem to be a ton of wiggle room on the menu \u00a0- what's on the menu is what you get with the only switch out option being if you get seafood entrees you can pick your own sauce - and when your food comes out they immediately dust it with grated parmesan cheese. There was a sign someplace that said something about inform your server if you have an allergy, but with some of the folks I know having severe allergies to one thing or another - I wouldn't risk it if you do. Just my thought, I could be wrong though.Anyways - overall this place was awesome. I felt comfortable, right at home, I loved our waiter Tony, I loved how the staff interacted with each other and the patrons, and I absolutely adored the food there. I could not think of a place that I would willing wait 75-90 minutes for on a second occasion, but I would ABSOLUTELY wait that long for Giacomo's again.

There's a lot to cover, so I'll break it down for you:1) The waitYes, you will have to wait. On a recent weekend, I arrived with a group of five at 5:30pm. We were inside in about an hour. That seemed typical of most parties, through groups of two and three were able to sit a bit faster. It was chilly, but definitely worth it. We met some very interesting fellow diners in line--great bonding experience with strangers! I suggest picking up something to enjoy while you wait, maybe a pastry from one of the North End's great bakeries.2) The foodThis is what really matters! The food at Giacomo's is pure heaven. I was a dedicated Daily Catch fan until this trip, and I do not hesitate to say that Giacomo's is better. I'm not sure which was fresher--the pasta or the seafood! Here's what we ate:-Pumpkin tortellini-sweet nuggets of pumpkin in a firm but light dough. The sage sauce is killer.-Lobster ravioli- salty-sweet chunks of whole lobster meal bound together with strands of mozzarella. The garlic cream sauce is rich, not sharp.-Seafood pasta (mussels, clams, scallops) with white sauce- I make a fine white sauce myself. This is better. The tangyness of white wine and depth of roasted garlic draw out that hint of ocean flavor in the seafood. Simple, but perhaps the best thing on the menu--a meal that dances.-Fried calamari- Tender and juicy.3) The atmosphereNot exactly a leisurely dinner. Between your own hunger and the line outside, you may devour your dinner whole. It's okay, no judgement passed. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable, happy to get extra sauce, bread, or water, or just to chat about how awesome the food is. They keep things moving without hurrying the patrons. The stairs to the bathroom are precarious, hot, and loud, but it was clean and comfortable.4) The tips-Don't eat the bread as soon as you get in! You'll need that room for your dinner, and it's much better used to soak up the last bits of delicious sauce from your plate.-Don't get the Parmesan cheese on top of your dish. A matter of personal choice, I recognize, but the quality of the sauce is far better than the quality of the cheese. -Share with friends. That way, you can try more deliciousness!-Have dessert first.

We had to experience an Italian dinner. Giacomo's was perfect for that goal.Such a homey, romantic, and cozy atmosphere...and you've got some hands down Italian servers (well, most of them) with the accent and everything. It's amazing. You enter and you salivate with the smell of garlic, butter and herbs being sauteed in the open kitchen bar, facing the diners.The tables are too close to each other as the space is kind of small. We could actually overhear 2 first dates as we dined. One was cool, one was really nervous. It was funny. The tables were wonderfully set with plates and glasses and utensils.

That's how crazy this place gets.Since then, we've learned to come here on slightly less chaotic occasions (weekdays, and dine either really early or really late).I had the best risotto I've ever had here. It was a seafood risotto - white, creamy, with chunks of scallop, and a heavy accent of dry white wine, for $25. It was on their seasonal menu, and I never saw it again :(I love the texture of their linguini - I don't know how restaurants do it, but they always get the perfect al dente bite, and this place is no exception. Somehow, they are able to make their linguini so that you don't get sick from eating massive amounts of carbs - that is truly the mark of an excellent Italian restaurant when you can gorge yourself without feeling sick at all (compare to Olive Garden, hahaha).I like their red sauce, and their red+spicy sauce (don't remember the actual names) - try their big seafood pasta that has everything in it once (it's enough to feed 2 people), and then in following visits pick and choose the type of seafood you want (shrimp only, shrimp+mussels...etc.). I've always thought their mussels are subpar, but that may be just me. I've consistently thought their pesto sauce is the worst sauce they have there.Their CALAMARI is fantastic - the tomato sauce that comes with it goes extremely well with the fried calamari, and the peppers are the kicker that pushes the dish over from excellent to mind-blowingly excellent. We've continually ordered a serving per 2 people, because one for 4 is simply not enough - everything is going to be gone in less than 10 minutes -_____-I've tried their butternut squash ravioli, but found it to be too sweet for my taste.

About 30 seconds later, the manager came out of the restaurant and yelled after the couple, \"THANKS FOR BEING SO GENEROUS!\" The couple came back to the restaurant, threw $5 at the manager, and left again.

We were then seated. woo hoo.-be prepared to make nice with your neighbors! the tables are super close together, it makes maneuvering and jacket taking-offing awkward.- Our waitress was nice but busy. she brought out some bread- room temp wheat bread w/ olive oil... good thing it was just bread, right? no big whoop.-We ordered some calamari as an app. super good, I 100% recommend it. the breading is light and the calamari isn't rubbery. -We took our waitresses advice by ordering the lobster ravioli and pumpkin tortellini. My cousin ordered the shrimp linguini with the diavolo sauce.--the lobster ravioli \u00a0really good, the cream sauce was great. \u00a0Initially I didn't think it would fill me up, but boy is it deceiving, after I had finished, I was surprised by how satisfying it was.--My sister loved her Pumpkin tortellini, I wasn't a big fan of it that night or the next with the leftovers, I thought it was way too sweet.--My cousin's dish was by far the biggest portion. She loved it, especially the sauce. If you are super super hungry- I'd suggest the linguini- it's a mountain of food; but in the end it is just pasta, sauce, and shrimp... tough to mess up, no?- the entrees range between $15-20. with the specials priced higher but still all below $30. Not bad, right?-It's cash only but there is an ATM across the street- I'd suggest going before you are seated because it's tough & awkward to move around the place.-We noticed that by the time we were seated and about to order (6330ish), the line outside had extended beyond the restaurant; easily to beyond 15 people.

If you want large portions of pretty good food for $14 to $20 per dish, with a 45 minute to hour wait for a table, then this is the place for you.I'll start by saying it isn't a bad restaurant, but why it is so popular is a bit of a mystery.The restaurant basically specializes in large portions of food that tastes fine but are really not true Italian dishes.I, however, prefer to taste the components of a dish, have my pasta al dente, and for the chef to compose the dish rather than allowing me to pair the pasta, protein, and sauce. \u00a0Seriously, I thought about walking out when the waitress asked what kind of sauce I wanted and gave me a card with an option of six, one of which was called \"giacomo sauce.\" \u00a0I knew at that point that I was not about to have a fine dining experience. \u00a0The giacomo sauce was basically alfredo sauce and marinara mixed together. \u00a0The alfredo sauce was poured out of a pitcher.The majority of the menu is seafood based, so my girlfriend and I tried the \"house specialty\" zuppa di mare. \u00a0NOTE: this is the \"house specialty\" not the house \"special\" and I double checked with the waitress that it was something that the kitchen was proud to present. \u00a0It was huge, with a ton of poorly cooked shellfish (lobster, overdone; muscles, overdone; clams, overdone; scallops, waaay overdone; calamari pretty well cooked). \u00a0It was advertised as dinner for two, but easily could have fed six. Again, not my thing, but if you like large portions you may enjoy it. \u00a0Overall, the taste was decent, it just wasn't anything special, and I find it offensive that sooo many people told me how great this place was after I expressed that I had been disappointed by many North End Italian places in Boston that I considered to be faux Italian.The wine list is small and consists mainly of mediocre California wines, none of which are truly appealing. Also, the restaurant itself is just hot. \u00a0It was 15 to 20 degrees warmer inside than outside, which made it about 102 degrees while we were there. \u00a0It probably lends some authenticity, but seems more like a ploy to keep turning the tables over and get people in and out of the door. \u00a0Additionally, the table behind me was a four top, and none of their food came out together. \u00a0The first pasta dish was delivered to one of the diners at the table at least 10 minutes before the last entree was brought out.Most of the diners were eating pasta, which was cooked roughshod on a flat top boiling pot, and often left on counters for far too long to maintain the integrity of the pasta or the texture. \u00a0Basically, al dente is not going to be an option. \u00a0None of the pasta is handmade, which I understand, but they should at least try to cook it properly.The staff is very friendly, but after quietly inviting each table to join in, they did sing happy birthday to a customer.

The special comes with a bottle of any of the $17 wine. We got the Savignon Blanc and it was refreshing but not the best white wine I've ever tried or anything. The mussel dish came out first (we were sharing everything, although we never told our server Donna that) and while it had great flavor, we thought the linguine was undercooked. I'm not talking al dente, I'm talking borderline crunchy/hard to chew. OK you're busy, but you're an Italian restaurant. you CANNOT mess up pasta. Why couldn't you spare another minute or two? The special arrived at our table about 10 minutes later, and WOW it was an impressive looking platter! (Not plate- it's a HUGE PLATTER of pasta.) It was topped with all kind of seafood (clams, mussels, TWO LOBSTERS, squid, etc) But like the first dish, this one tasted rushed also. The wine in the sauce had yet to evaporate, and the pasta here was also a little too al dente, though not as undercooked as the first dish. we all agreed that it tasted better about 15 minutes after it arrived at our table, when the pasta had cooked in the sauce and the alcohol had dissipated.Oh, the complimentary bread and olive oil is completely unremarkable. Kind of disappointing.For our party of 3, the bill came out to about $100 after tax and tip. Very delicious, but the wait and dining environment leaves much for improvement.

Their entire menu is on the wall), but the food and ambiance of the place is lovely. The owner, or what I presume is the owner or manager, comes around pretty often and checks on you or makes conversation with you. He likes to ask where you're from, and literally knows every single place a person mentions. It's pretty funny. He seems like a friendly guy, and he tries to make every customer happy.The food was amazing, and myself and three friends cleaned our plates. The sauces were tasty, the seafood was fresh, and the chicken was perfectly moist and tender. My friend got pumpkin tortellini and said it was better than his mother's cooking!

Are you willing to wait in a long queue for a while so you can sit inside? Do you have enough cash to pay a little less $20 for your dish? If you said yes to all of the questions above, this place has your answer. If you are looking for just the one and only place for a seafood pasta dinner in the Italian North End, where the prices are moderate for a meal, then this is probably one of the best choices. It's been about two years since I last ate at this place, but I finally got a chance to revisit again after hanging out with a couple of people I know from the Toronto area that were visiting. I decided to get the $19 Fruitti di Mare, which had mussels, shrimp, calamari, clams and scallops. I decided to get Fra Diavolo Sauce, which is a red tomato sauce with a little spice. The people that I know got the $20 special dish where you get half of a lobster, with mussels, clams, and shrimp doused in the Giacomo's sauce, which is a red tomato flavored sauce similar to the Fra Diavolo sauce, but with no spice at all. The pasta served was linguini, which is a thin, flat, wide, but curvy noodle-shaped pasta. Pasta portions continue to be excellent. One pasta dish should be enough to fill the stomach of a very hungry man. The seafood is freshly cooked and tasty. I liked the Fra Diavolo sauce more than the Giacomo's sauce mainly due to the spice in the flavor. The Giacomo's sauce was good, but tasted almost like an ordinary but good quality tomato sauce. The shrimp was meaty and plump, and the calamari had a nice tender texture. Lobster is freshly cooked, and I spent a considerable amount of time eating every piece of meat on my lobster piece. Scallops were tender and also tasty, but were not too big. The clams and mussels were tasty, but are really small. We also had a small plate of Calamari as an appetizer, and it is probably one of the tastiest calamari dishes I had. Nice and crispy on the outside, and tender and chewy on the inside. The sauce provided made the calamari even tastier. Bread portions are a little small, but I got my stomach full from eating a lot of the pasta.Since this place is really popular and the queues are long, I think a good time to come here is probably on a weekday at around 8:30 PM and not on a Friday or a Saturday evening. The wait was considerably shorter on a Monday than on a Saturday. Service is actually good, the server was really nice and able to answer any questions you may have. They are really nice enough to give you some tools to help you eat your lobster. They only take cash, so make sure you have some $20 banknotes in your pocket. The bathrooms are small, and it feels like you are actually going down the deck of a boat when you walk to the bathrooms. Overall, this place continues to be a representation of Boston's seafood pasta dishes at its finest. If you are looking for a spacious and big restaurant, this is probably not the type of place I would recommend, but if you are looking for an almost excellent seafood pasta dish at a moderate price, and you are willing to sit at a small table, then this is a great choice.", "Date": "2012-05-11", "Author_Location": "Boston, MA"}, {"Author": "Molly W.", "ReviewID": "97bhqO61frqLYXRZcD4zzA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Oh Holy GOD how I wish I was Italian.Waiting in line is not something I do when I am hungry, but I am glad we did for this place.

Immediately one of the girls took out her camera and started to take pictures of the beautiful dish and the waiter snatched her camera away and yelled in a good natured way \"food is for eating! not taking pictures!\" the entire restaurant (all 15 tables) laughed and that is when I knew I was going to have a fantastic meal. - calamari appetizer: it was so good that we regretted not ordering the large- seafood pasta with a combination of the giacomo sauce and their spicier sauce (as recommended from the \"food is for eating! man\" : as soon as it was set down in front of me the man asked me \"do you want cheese?\" and before I could answer him he quickly said \"yes, you need cheese. I will get the cheese.\" By now, I just wanted to ask him if I could be his adopted korean granddaughter. The pasta? Lets just say it was so delicious I have dreams about that dish- chicken marsala: it was good, no complaints but not as memorable as the previous two.

Giacomo's is all that. After living in Boston the better part of forever, I finally got to the North End location last night with some friends visiting from the Midwest. The wait for a table of 5 was something along the lines of 45-60 minutes, but we had expected that. We got the two appetizers people rave about: a large order of calamari and an order of broccoli in garlic butter. They were stellar. The broccoli was fresh, al dente, and the sauce was sublime. The calamari was light, meltingly tender, crunchy and just outrageously delicious. For entrees, we had four entrees. One was the pumpkin ravioli with mascarpone sauce that everybody raves about. A friend put one of those suckers in his mouth and just had to close his eyes and tilt his head back in bliss. You too will be whisked into another intergalactic dimension-cum-nirvana of yumminess if you order it. I had to slap the wait staff's hands so I could lick the plate clean before they took the dish away. We also got the eggplant parmiagana. Now, this is the right way to cook eggplant: You get a deli meat slicer and you shave ultra-thin slices of eggplant so that the layers in this dish are distinct and light, as opposed to the globby blob wonders that come out of some kitchens, with eggplant slabs in a congested confusion of tomato sauce and cheese. What I'm saying is that Giacomo's does it right, does it perfect. For the other entrees, we got two dishes of pasta: one had mussels and shrimps with Giacomo's sauce, which we think was some type of pleasant, light tomato with perhaps a touch of cream sauce. It was nice, but not eye-rolly nice. The final entree was fettucini with tuna and swordfish chunks in a pesto cream sauce. The pesto cream sauce was delicious, but the fish chunks were meager. I think next time I'd just order the swordfish steak. We got two bottles of Sangiovese off a delightfully affordable wine list that had a good selection of serviceable wine for $17/bottle. They do have reserve wines for the deep-pocketed, but the Sangiovese suited us just fine. It's crowded, it's homey, the chalkboard has the menu handwritten (but it's the same menu as the paper menu, so no need to squint or sit close to it), the service was brisk and competent, we got stuffed. We thanked our lucky stars that we hadn't fallen prey to our starving-artist cheap-ass impulses. We could have gotten a Groupon or Yelp deal to Davide, or another one to some other North End restaurant with a ton of mediocre reviews, but we said screw it, let's go get some food we know we'll love. After all, Giacomo's prices are absolutely reasonable, particularly given that it's in the touristy North End, and particularly given the quality of the food. For a party of 5, we paid $137, which included an 18% gratuity and two bottles of wine. Go, by all means. Don't compromise your dinner out in the North End by being in a rush or wanting to save a few bucks with a coupon to an inferior restaurant.. Be prepared for a long wait.

I recently absolved myself of my gastronomic sins by paying penitence waiting for an hour in line to enter Giacomo's in subzero weather. Once I got through the proverbial pearly gates, though, I knew all was forgiven; I was in heaven. Not a place to linger without fear of being slapped in the back of the head by an Italian grandmother (at least as I like to imagine it), it's worth the wait and worth the rush. The place is small and therefore turnover can take some time, but this adds to the character. Plus, the hoard of people pressing their hungry faces up against the glass watching you eat makes you feel like a celebrity, or zoo animal, but the popular kind, like a panda or something. A simple, classic Italian menu is presented to you, and it's hard to choose which plate to try because they are all guaranteed winners. I went with a pumpkin tortellini with sage cream sauce which perfectly melded the sweet and the savory into one tender pastalicious bite. My beau enjoyed his linguine in Giacomo's sauce, a lobster-based red sauce, enough to practically lick his plate. (I am happy to report he refrained.) Every other dish was both delectable and decimated. Bottles of wine top out at $16 each, and appetizers are sizable and affordable. The table shared a plate of calamari, which my father still mentions in every phone call we've had since then. Everyone who ate it loved it, leaving not a tentacle or ring behind.

Fried heaven. I've always gotten the Giacomo's Special for two. Honestly, the best part is that it's a good deal. For like $50 you get a whole lobster, more than enough mussels, clams, shrimps, and the occasional jackpot (scallops!). Other than that, I'd say that the dish itself isn't the best thing that I've ever had. For some reason, the sauce just reminds me of Buca's (chain Italian restaurant) Frutti di Mare pasta. Sad. Oh, the $10 bottle of wine is also a fabulous deal. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant with such cheap alcohol! If you want the Boston experience, and the more bang for your buck, you should definitely consider going to Gaicomo's for dinner. BONUS: 1) The wait is always ridiculously/annoying long. It's NOT worth the wait. I'd recommend that you just go around 8-8:30PM. You won't have to wait. I've come here around that time on a Tuesday and Sunday, and I've probably waited at max 5 minutes on both occasions.

Since this place had such great reviews and the price seemed right, we figured we'd give it a shot. For people who haven't been, beware that it is a TINY place that does not take reservations and is cash only. We knew this going in so it wasn't too big of a deal.We arrived and there was a line out the door, which is understandable since the restaurant is so small; we put our party size down and were told that it would be about 20 minutes (obviously about 40, in restaurant time). The wait wasn't too bad though; we were in no rush and more than willing to wait for what was supposed to be a superb meal. However, that was not what we got.Sure, the food was good, but 40 minutes standing in the cold good? Nah. The service was also so fast that it was actually a bit sloppy; the waitress was nice, but got impatient when one member of our party took more than a few seconds to order. I understand that they are trying to move people in and out rather fast, but the efficiency which which they took our orders, served, and billed us had the effect of making the meal feel rushed. This would have been fine if the food made up for it, but that sadly was not the case.I ordered the caprese salad for an apetizer and it was fine, but nothing spectacular. The roasted red peppers that came with it were a nice touch, but it seemed to be a little light with the mozzarella; there wasn't enough to go with all the tomatoes/peppers. Not a big deal. The real deal breaker of the meal was our entrees; my pasta came out fast, but literally floating in a pool of grease---- there was more oil on the plate than actual sauce! It tasted good, mainly because of the butternut filling, but I found it inexcusable that they would plate a dish that looked like a grease-soup. My girlfriend's was also similarly greasy, though not as bad (we suspect they cooked ours in the same pan and plated mine second, causing all the grease to pool on mine). Our friend's pumpkin tortellini was not greasy, but rather unremarkable. The sauce was rather bland and the filling just mediocre. If I could do it again, there's no way I'd wait that long for a meal thats just \"okay.\" Thus, 2.5 stars. Decent food, but not worth the wait.

I've lived in the North End for 2 years and never got around to going here because the line was always so absurd. But last night, me and my boyfriend FINALLY decided to do it. We figured 5pm on a Monday wouldn't have the longest wait.So we ended up waiting about 30/40 min. Got to our little cramped table. And let me tell you - it was a VERY disappointing experience.I have never been so rushed at a restaurant in my life. We sat, ordered, ate, paid in a total of about 35 minutes.The waiter was SO rude. Literally walked away while we were in the middle of our sentences, dropped the plates on the table, barely said a word (until the end, when he probably realized we control his tip). At one point he even came over with cheese \u00a0and without a word, poured it all over my boyfriend's dish, which he neither ask for nor wanted. Food came super fast. TOO fast. We got the buratta cheese appetizer, which was pretty good but very small. There wasn't much to it. Bunch of diced tomatoes and a ball of cheese.My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm, and wanted it in the giacomo sauce, but we were told that you can only pick sauces for seafood dishes, and before my boyfriend even had time to decide if he wanted to keep or change his order, the waiter was gone. The chicken parm came - it was decent, nothing special. They actually forgot to bring his side of pasta until he was done with the chicken.I had their famed butternut squash ravioli. I must say, it was really good. But would I ever wait 2 hours in the cold for it? Absolutely not. Overall, it is so not worth the wait. The experience of a restaurant is VERY important, and the atmosphere and service ruined our dinner.I advise you guys go to Nico, right down the block.

We waited in line for an hour and a half. It is what it is, but we expected to be treated like we had just waited an hour and a half by the staff. No such luck. My GF went to use the restrooms and before she got back I was prodded for our dinner orders. I told the waitress we'd need some time so I ordered a bottle of wine and the soft-shell crab appetizer. When my GF arrived the waitress was on top of us asking if we'd decided. My GF asked for a few minutes as we had just waited an hour and a half to sit down. The waitress said \"I tell everyone they wait longer in line than it takes to eat dinner.\" That's cute and all, but I don't really give a crap. I wait for a nice dining experience, I pay for a nice dining experience, I deserve a nice dining experience.So we get the butternut squash ravioli, as my GF has gotten for the past nine years, and I got the Fucilli in Giacomo's sauce. Both were terrific as was the soft-shell crab. As we were trying to enjoy our wine and talk, a woman came by the table and filled our wine glasses to the brim! Literally! Usually that wouldn't be so obnoxious to me, but because I knew they just wanted us out I was extremely annoyed. The entire meal may have taken us a half hour, and that's only because we were being stubborn about taking our time. We saw two couples come and go at the table next to us before we got up. The first couple came in at the same time as us after waiting just as long as us and were served their entrees as my GF got back from the restroom!!! How ridiculous.

After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try especially since I wanted a legit Italian dining experience. I knew that there would probably be a line and that it was cash only, so I went early and armed. Arrived outside the restaurant around 5:35pm, and there was already a line of about 7 people. I immediately thought \"Uh oh\" especially since I could see that the space was small but then I reconciled that thought because no other Italian restaurant within sight had a line, which probably meant that the food was worth waiting for or that it was super-hyped. My wait time was only about 10 minutes. I was promptly seated and my server explained the menu ... pick a seafood and a sauce. Since I had researched Giacomo's before arriving, I knew exactly what I wanted ... calamari (appetizer), mussels with the spicy lobster sauce ($14), and a glass of cabernet ($5). The bread arrived and although it was room temperature (I am a sucker for fresh warm bread), it was crusty, chewy, and delicious. It is the kind of quality bread that really sticks to the palate. Soon afterward, my calamari arrived. Since it was a small order ($7), I had expected a few pieces ... no, this portion was very generous. I stared at it and said \"Wow! Is that all for me?\" The calamari was delicious. I marveled at the ratio of breading to squid and appreciated that each piece of squid was perfectly cooked ... tender, NOT chewy. Included with the calamari were breaded and fried jalapenos and other peppers. Delicious!! The marinara dipping sauce was perfect as well, with just the right level of acidity and sweetness. I couldn't wait to try the entree.When the entree arrived, I was stunned because of the portion size and because of the generous amount of mussels included with the dish. The mussels lined the entire perimeter of the plate and were fresh and delicious. The sauce was spicy and succulent, with just enough zest to warm me up. I could taste hints of the lobster. Definitely a very well-made sauce with delicate nuances in flavor. The pasta was cooked well and the entire dish was very good, and made me want to try every dish on the menu.

It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, though it was a bit fishy if you were just eating it by itself. The mushroom risotto was a bit too rich for my taste, probably due to the excess cheese in there (not a huge fan of cheese myself).

Giacomo's does a good job with their calamari and even spices things up a little by putting some red and green pepers in the mix. A small portion is only $7 and the portion is for 2. Entree: Frutti di Mare with Giacomo SauceOut of my entire East Coast trip (including NY), this was by far the best entree I had. This entree had so much seafood it feels like you are eating the entire ocean. I ended up finishing all the linguine before finishing the seafood. Don't get me wrong there was a lot of linguine too. The mix of seafood in it included muscles, calamari, clams, scallops, and shrimp. The scallops were the freshest and biggest scallops I have ever seen. The Giacomo sauce was a good pairing with this dish because it was not overpowering and I could taste the true freshness of the seafood. I could not believe that the entire thing only cost $19!Entree: Mussels, Clam and 1/2 Lobster with Pesto SauceThe lobster...fresh and big. This dish trumps the lobster pasta at Daily Catch because it costs half as much and still tastes just as good. The pesto isn't the best pairing with seafood because it can take away the fresh seafood taste. I would go the Giacomo sauce. Still can't believe this entre only cost $20.The service here is fast and right to the point, just like the typical Boston attitude.

Compared to the rest of Hanover St. it was great food for slightly cheaper prices. The fall back is that there are no reservations so you can expect to wait upwards of over an hour in order to get a seat in this rather small restaurant. I'm a patient person and I say that the wait was well worth it! After looking online for the opening times so that we could line up early, Chris and I got there half an hour early only to see that the house was already packed and a line had formed! At 4:30 when opening hours was supposed to be at 5! However, since it was still fairly early, we only ended up waiting half an hour before getting seated.For appetizers we shared a small calamari and antipasto. The calamari was fresh and hot with just the right amount of seasoning. The peppers and cocktail sauce added another dimension to the dish that made it some of the best calamari I've ever had; and even better, it stayed hot for our entire meal! The soppresatta in the antipasto was great. In general, the antipasto served as a good pairing to the calamari. Very good! For the main course we shared the house special -- Zuppa di Pesce in Fra Como sauce with White Zinfandel. This dish was a monster. It completely dwarfed the two seater table that we sat at. The waiter had to replate our appetizers and bread just to make sure everything fit. If you're a seafood lover you must get this dish! There's so much seafood and pasta that I was able to make two more meals out of the leftovers,...and this was after sitting there for two hours eating my heart out. If you like spicy red sauce definitely pair the fra como with the special, this spicy lobster sauce added to the savoriness and succulence of the dish. \u00a0The atmosphere was good. Everyone was obviously enjoying themselves and having fun conversing with their dinner partners. It definitely is cramped so if you're not comfortable with possibly getting overheard then that's something to consider. The waiter was very helpful in helping us choose our dishes and spot on in predicting when we needed his attention. One downside besides the wait is the cleanliness. I had to send back our water glasses because there were oil stains all over it -- only to get a glass that was just slightly cleaner.

It's a very solid Italian restaurant.We knew if we didn't get there early enough on Friday that we would be waiting for a long time. The plan was to get there right at opening so our wait would be minimal and hopefully non-existent. After strolling around the North End, being not from Boston, we decided to stroll by the restaurant about 20 minutes before they opened just to find out where it was. When we walked by, there was a group waiting outside, but we were also surprised to see people sitting inside ordering food. Apparently they will open up the place before their official opening time. Not knowing the deal, we took another walk around the block before we went back at 5. We still were able to get right in with no wait. But if you don't mind eating early, if you get there before they actually open, there is a chance you could get a table with no wait.The food was outstanding. I had a fusilli seafood special. The homemade pasta is awesome. I tried the Giacomo's sauce which did not disappoint either. I inhaled all my food. The girlfriend tried the butternut squash ravioli, which she loved. I sampled a piece. Delicious. More butter than nut in those ravioli. Really, really good. Not to mention, the price can't be beat.

There were times when it felt like the line was never going to move again, but we did have the opportunity to speak with the couples in line around us. Eventually we got in, and the dining room is quite cramped. But there was something about it, some sort of vibe that you could tell that the food was being taken seriously.We never got a menu when we sat down - there's a giant chalkboard on one side with the regular menu, and one on the other side with the specials. Also, there's one small paper menu outside, that you have time to read about fifty times before you get inside, so menus inside are completely irrelevant. I will say ths: Giacomo's has a simple menu. I think that's a good thing. There's nice variety on it, but not enough menu sprawl to be paralyzing.We ordered a large calamari appetizer, and it was pretty good. It comes with some pepper slices deep fried with the squid. The flavor was good, but it was a tiny bit on the chewy side, so it was a tad overcooked. I would order it again, both to see if it they get it 100%, and because it was still good, especially with the sauce they bring it with. Also, the bread they bring out is decent, but nothing to go crazy over. The olive oil on the table is very good though, with that nice peppery edge that fresh olive oil tends to have. Bland crap from a chain it is not.So, when our server - Tony - came by and asked us \"What do you kids having for supper\" I ordered the Frutti di Mare, and my wife ordered the Gnocci which was a special. We also both ordered a Chianti with dinner.Both meals were fantastic. The seafood in my Frutti was cooked as well or better than any seafood I've ever had before, especially the scallops. My goodness, the scallops were beyond good. They were exceptional. I had it in the Giacomo's sauce, which was excellent, because it's lobster based. I ended up with a bonus lobster leg in my meal. Oh, darn. :-) My wife's meal was very very good, but I didn't have more than a bite or two, because I was so infatuated with mine.Here's the bottom line about Giacomo's for me. We ordered: Large Calamari, Frutti di Mare, Gnocci special and two glasses of wine. The total check was a reasonable $58. Let me repeat that: $58. In the North End. In Boston. Boston, Massachusetts. I cannot go to the Olive Garden and get pre-made and reheated food for that price. And Giacomo's is cranking it out in an open kitchen.They don't serve dessert. They want your seat for the people still standing in line, so we went to Mike's. Perfect.The service wasn't white-glove, but it was prompt, attentive and very inviting. I felt like I was eating in Tony's home - and that's a great feeling when everyone working at this particular house is uber-Italian. So, while the price you pay for the food is tempered somewhat by the potentially enormous wait to get inside, you simply won't be disappointed. The value is incredible, and the food is incredible. The only thing that I would change is that I would ask for the Fra Diavolo and Giacomo sauce mix for my Frutti. Next time. In the end, I could dock Giacomo's a star for the wait, but really, it kind of adds to the charm, and frankly, I'd rather wait than pay more at a less impressive restaurant down the street. I'd wait again, and eat again.

So we trekked over there and noticed the long line that had formed outside. We were already there, so there was no going back. The line moved pretty quickly and before we knew it we were seated. Service was very brusque and understandably so because it was prime dinner time and the place was PACKED. We ordered the calamari, burrata salad and fruitti de mare (with lobster and mussels). Not one miss! Everything was so delicious. The calamari was crisp and tender (they also fry up some cherry peppers with it), while the burrata was fresh, soft and delicate. Oh and the tomatoes! They were perfectly ripe. And we may or may not had a couple baskets of bread. Yes, its good and it's fresh...I saw them bringing in the huge loaves one morning at the Columbus Ave. location. Once the plate of fruitti de mare was placed in front of me, my eyes must've looked like they were going to pop out of their sockets. A whole half lobster and a ton of mussels! Pasta was just an afterthought; this was all about the seafood, and I didn't mind one bit. My friend was actually getting full so she had some lobster and a couple of mussels...MORE FOR ME! I surprised myself and killed the entire thing. Sweet, fresh seafood!

I read that this was the best Italian place in Boston, and I love me some Italian food. I went in with high expectations, and though they were not fully met, it was still a good experience, enough to warrant 4 stars.The wait here is supposedly really long, so we dropped my brother off at the restaurant to get on the waiting list while we drove around to look for parking. It was the best idea I've ever had, because by the time we found a lot to park in ($25, I was crying inside) and walked back to the restaurant, we were just in time to be seated. No wait, hooray!The staff was super nice but the pace here is quick. It's not a restaurant where you sit around and chat over dessert and coffee in the end, more of an order, eat, out kind of place. And since the place is tiny and they have a large line, it makes sense. We ordered the calamari appetizer, the butternut squash ravioli, and seafood spinach fettuccine to share. The calamari was good, though it got a bit too salty for me towards the end, and I could have done without the jalapenos that were also fried and served with the calamari. I felt like it was more of a filler and felt slightly jipped of calamari :(. The ravioli was absolutely fabulous, the pasta had a great bite and the butternut squash was sweet. I loved that there was asparagus included in it and the sauce was creamy and rich. Definitely a dish to get there every time, I could see why it was a favorite amongst yelpers. The seafood spinach fettuccine was a mixed bag for me though. I LOVED how fresh the seafood was, the salmon was amazing, cooked perfectly. The spinach and sundried tomatoes it was cooked with gave great flavor and I loved the sauce. What I did not love, however, was the fettuccine itself. The pasta was overcooked and not salted enough when boiled. That was quite a letdown for me since I love pasta so much. But that was really the only major complaint I had about the meal. Well, that and the jalapenos in my calamari. Overall, it is a solid Italian restaurant.

I promptly looked it up on yelp and the reviews look fantastic! So I stopped by early the next day, filled with excitement to try this place out. Waited in line, no problem, that's to be expected. Promptly seated, excellent. The waitress approached me and went over the spill of menu on the board and the specials and took my order, OK so good so far. While I was waiting for my food, I was trying to correspond some stuff on my phone (no, not talking on the phone, just emailing and internet). Then an older male waiter (I think he's the owner) came up behind me and practically threw the plate in front of me hence pushing the phone out of the way. Then, he said to me, \"put your phone away and eat your supper!!\" I was sort of caught off guard and a little embarrassed. Since it is a small restaurant, almost everyone turned around and was staring at me. I shrugged my shoulder and laughed it off thinking maybe he was just trying to be funny and promptly thanked him and put my phone away. Just as when I was about to dig in, he came up again and began to add powder cheese to my food without even asking and practically shoved the forks in my hand out of the way. Now I'm agitated. I was okay being talked down to like an 8 year old, I have thick skin, it didn't bother me all that much. But when you start to mess with people's food without even asking, now that is crossing the line. To be honest, the food was probably pretty good, but I was so fumed I didn't even enjoy it. If I pay $30+ for a meal, I expect at least the meal would be the way I wanted it and a little bit of courtesy and respect. By having great food doesn't mean you can mistreat your customers.

We arrived to the North End around 5pm and decided to walk around perusing the Italian shops, restaurants, and bakeries. It was pretty quite considering it was a Thursday, except for one restaurant among a sea of Italian restaurants. I've been to Giacomo's three times and every time it's always packed to the hilt with a queue forming outside along its windows. The Jekyll and Hyde inside everyone becomes apparent during the transition from waiting to eating. When you're in line all you want to do is yell, punch, kick, and scream at the happy eaters to hurry their asses up because \"I'm Hungry!\". You ask yourself if anyone would notice if you went inside and just started taking food off peoples plates and guzzling wine right from their tableside wine bottles. \u00a0 Would these crazy people who keep bumping into you care at all? Would anyone care? \u00a0Arghhhhhhh! It seems the moment you reach your \"Jekyll Climax\" your name is called and you feel happy/excited like you won a game of Keno from a deli in a Vegas hotel..... Once your seated you want to take your time sipping the wine slowly, savor every bite, then marinate in your chair hoping you get hungry again soon to finish the meal or maybe order more. Giacomo's is a 10 table sort of restaurant with a family country bumpkin feel. The recipes are surely passed down from grandma to granddaughter and so on. The menu is classic Italian in every way and very simple. Giacomo's sticks with what they know and trust me... they know Italian! Everything on the menu is very good; however, my favorite and the best Italian meal I've ever had was Giacomo's House Special. I've been all over Italy from Milan to Tuscany to Venice to Rome to Florance to Cinque Terre and back to Bellagio. Giacomo's was the best and cheap for what you get. The House Special was designed for two people to split; however we were four and couldn't finish it. This behemoth of a pasta had a rich and spicy \"arribiata\" sauce which used lobster as its base. The linguine pasta had a dozen mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. It was then topped with an entire whole main lobster (about 2 lbs.).

Giacomo's was one of those places. Let me explain.I ordered their famous lobster ravioli, which was served piping hot in a garlic cream sauce. Delectable! The ravioli was obviously made fresh, and the lobster meat mixture inside them was just right. My companion ordered the veal parm, which I tasted, and thought was also excellent. The side of \"ziti\" (which actually was penne) that accompanied his veal parm was practically inedible. It was cold, overcooked, and completely unappealing. The bowl sat lonely at the side of our table, until the perplexed waiter took it away. This seems to me to be some kind of sacrilege if one is boasting an Italian menu, particularly in the North End. Fluke? Maybe. Since the penne was not the main star of our show, we didn't put that much stock into it. Sometimes, pasta goes wrong. Thankfully, we were both pretty pleased with our entrees. The table of four next to us ordered some enormous seafood platter that included lobster tails, mussels, clams and the like, which smelled really good. The service was somewhat disappointing-- two and a half stars. Our server, who had a loud, speedy, and jarring voice reminded us of a police radio dispatcher. He slid our water glasses towards us, reached over us without saying excuse me, forgot my diet coke, and kind of gave us that rushed feeling. After waiting almost an hour in the cold on a weeknight, we didn't really appreciate it.The other stuff: How can I not mention the wait? A line down the block, even on weeknights. I can't even begin to imagine what this place must look like on a Saturday night. I generally don't deduct for long waits (note: I five-starred Cuchi Cuchi AND Zaftig's, both of which are notorious for their long waits), but I found both the wait and the method of handling their waiting customers less than impressive. No list, no names, no reservations. Anything goes. No protection from the cold or rain, no little morsels of sustenance for hungry waiting customers. Won't penalize for that one, just making a point. Dude. I watch Gordon Ramsey. The space was really unexpectedly small. The tables are jammed so close together, that the people from the table next to us had to actually get up to let us in and out of our seats. Two and a half stars on the space, setup, and customer service. So what's a girl to do? If Yelp allowed me those damn half stars, I'd feel pretty good about awarding Giacomo's three and a half stars. Fourish-star food, minus a little for all the other nonsense. After some thought though, \u00a0I'm sorry, Giacomo's, but I'm rounding down to three stars. There's just a little too much room for improvement this time around.

I find it disrespectful when places don't make the time and minimal effort to properly advertise important things like hours. Both the website and the door say 5pm. They opened at 4:30 that day and I had told my friends to meet me at 5. This means I was standing outside for 45 minutes instead of 15 and had I known the correct time I would have told them. The woman was unapologetic and brushed it off like whatever. It was also raining all day and they won't let you in until your entire party is there. Our server wasn't much better with the attitude, both older women with short hair. When we went to pay our bill we all had 20's because this place doesn't take credit cards and we had just gone to the atm. We just needed a few 10's. When we asked for change for 2 \u00a020's the woman said no and said she will get us change for one and walked away. my jaw dropped. um if you want to get paid and want a tip especially, then you should get us change and what kind of attitude is that?? The attitude seems to be the door revolves so quickly that if you aren't happy so what. Maybe you should take credit cards if this is an issue. It's not like we asked for a bunch of singles or nickles. It was taking us a while to try to pay the bill and we were irritable at this point so she did give in and offer to get us change to get us out of there it seemed like. \u00a0A good restaurant does not rush you, especially when you are not dawdling, and other people here commented on feeling rushed so that is not good business. If it were up to me I \u00a0would have just taken the money we were trying to work out out of her tip and the bill would be no issue but my friends are nice.When we first got there we went to our table where it was set up with 3 chairs and for some bizarre reason they took one chair away and put it by the door, as if they were confused by the difference in 2 and 3 people. So we are standing there for a couple minutes while they move the table around and whatever then I finally ask where is our other chair?? They acted confused and brought back the chair. Service definitely needs some work and let's have enough respect for customers to post a sticker, change the website, anything to make sure the opening time is correct. They own Panza and I had the exact same issue with them before because the advertised hours were not accurate. I was a little underwhelmed overall.

I have never in my life been to a restaurant with so many employees who were this rude.When you get to the restaurant you will see an hour long line outside waiting to be seated. When you get closer to the door, the host will come out and ask you the number in your party. When it is finally your time to go in, the host will come out and yell out the number of people in your party then tell you a general area of the restaurant where your table is and then walk away, For my party of 4 we were told \"In the front\".The restaurant is very small. As we walked through the door, a party of four in the front of the restaurant began getting up from their seats to leave. Because there was hardly enough room for one person forget about two, I decided to step to the side by the door to let them out. Before they had even passed, our waitress began screaming at us \"In the front! In the front! Just go! In the front!\" When the other party had finally left, we went to our table which was actually in the back by the bar/kitchen (we knew this was our table because it was the only clean an empty table in the whole restaurant, there are only about 10 to begin with).We sat at our table for a good 5 minutes before our waitress came over and asked us if we had been to the restaurant before somewhat confused (what could possibly be so unique about an Italian restaurant in Little Italy?) we said no. \"Well let me get you menus then\" She then proceeded to patronizingly explain that the menu is the same as what was on the blackboard and that there were entrees on both sides of the menu (wow who knew?).We were given about 2 minutes to decide which would rarely be enough to even agree on an appetizer but fortunately we spent a good 15 minutes on line staring at the menu so most of us already knew what we wanted. The waitresses yell the appetizers across the room to the kitchen (which again, was in the room just behind a bar which made the entire room even hotter than it was outside) They would add a 'please' to the end of their yell, as if that made it polite. After writing down our entrees, the waitress then lectured us about how we needed to put our bread plates in front of us (then why did you set them on the corners of the table?) \"Oh no that ones not yours this one is yours.\" She then made us pass our plates to the left. She then lectured us about how we needed to make room in the middle of our table for the fried calamari which wouldn't even be served for another 10 minutes.The restaurant is far too small only out done by the size of our table. We had four people huddled around a small square table that two people would feel cramped at. We were close enough to the table next to us that we could breath on them. There was no room to be comfortable, I had to sit sideways so that I could get as close to the table as possible. And yet I still was smacked across the back every time a server walked past. I had to bend down and lean over the table just to take a sip of my drink because if my elbow ever left the perimeter of the table, my elbow would have been rammed and my drink sent flying, While taking one such sip the waiter brought our appetizer and almost smacked me in the head with it because he couldn't be bothered to wait two seconds for me to get out of the way. This wasn't the last time calamari was shoved in my face though. One piece had fallen onto the table while transferring to my plate (not a big deal, but I didn't really trust the table to be clean enough to eat off of). I put the dirty calamari on my plate when I was done, and so when the waitress came to take my plate she held it up to my face and said \"finish this last piece\", yea no thanks.The only slight glimmer in this train wreck was that the food was decent, but hey if you can't find a decent Italian restaurant in the North End that doesn't treat you like a herd of cattle, the North End would have gone under a long time ago. The waiters would clear your plate as soon as you finished your last bite even though everyone was still eating, one by one they would take someone's plate. Literally as the last plate was being taken, our waitress slapped the bill on the table.There really is no excuse for how god awful this restaurant is. Do let anyone tell you that this is a genuine Italian experience. I grew up in an Italian household. I have been to many different parts of Italy. I have never seen a waiter shoving whole pieces of bread in his face in full view of customers. I have never seen a waitress grab an elderly customer's chair and move it with her in it to \"balance the table out\". Don't give this sorry excuse for a restaurant your business or your dignity.

It is tiny, the waitresses shout at the busboy from anywhere in the restaurant, and you may get the back of your head elbowed a time or two. \u00a0I thought it was great, it felt like being inside their kitchen rather than being at a restaurant. \u00a0But, this may not be your style.We started with the calamari appetizer. \u00a0It was very fresh tasting, not chewy at all, and had just the right amount of breading. \u00a0The house special is a mixture of lobster, calamari, clams, and shrimp over linguine. \u00a0Get it with a bottle of wine for $10 bucks more. The wine (normally $15 a bottle) was fantastic for the price. \u00a0I would have been thrilled to come home with a $15 dollar bottle this good from the store, let alone to have it be $10 in a restaurant. \u00a0The seafood plate itself was huge. \u00a0We had to do some serious rearranging to get it to fit on the table. \u00a0Remaining calamari was moved to a bread plate, the bread basket was balanced on top of this, etc. \u00a0My favorite part of the entree was the fresh tasting pasta. \u00a0Nothing makes a meal like being able to tell the pasta was rolled out that day. \u00a0The seafood was all delicious and fresh. \u00a0My favorite was the scallops. my mom's was the shrimp, and my dad's was the lobster. \u00a0If there was one downside, I thought the Giacomo's sauce was a touch runny and would order a thicker or different one next time (of the choice of 5). \u00a0Not enough to knock it down a star though.The total bill including for appetizer, a bottle of wine, a huge entree (the menu board says its for 2, but we were stuffed on what we ordered), and a very generous tip was $100 for 3 people. \u00a0Not bad for such a great meal. \u00a0I hear the South End location is even better, I can't wait to try that.", "Date": "2008-10-18", "Author_Location": "Brookline, MA"}, {"Author": "Mary S.", "ReviewID": "X6RGrNGkyN1-0TU_pumWsw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "2 words says it all....Simply Amazing! \u00a0Its my 30th birthday and I just got back from eating at Giacomo's.

Before you go there, here are a some very important tips. 1) it's cash only 2) no reservations and there's always a line out the door, especially if you go at a peak time with nice weather 3) they will rush you. I once ate a meal, split a bottle of wine with my date and we were out in 27 minutes. literally. If you're looking to take your time and have a longer experience, my advice would be to either go somewhere nearby for a bottle of wine and appetizer, then go, or simply choose somewhere else. For option A, cantina italiano is a good option. Sit at the bar, have some antipasto and a bottle of wine, then head to Giacomo's for your entree. You can keep an eye on the line from Cantina - it's across the street. 4) the waiters and waitresses are salty as hell, but they're also characters. Have fun with them and you'll enjoy the experience. If you're sitting at the table texting away on your phone, they will tell you to put it away. As you should. Some may see that as rude - if you're that type, go somewhere else. They won't kiss your butt at Giacomo's.

These folks know what they're doing.Our waitress was super helpful and knowledgeable and on top of things. My water glass was never empty! We ordered the phenomenal antipasto as an appetizer. It was a good size, if not a little big for just 2 people. The only reason we stopped eating it was because we knew we had entrees coming and wanted to save room!I was very impressed that our meals were held until a few minutes after we ate our appetizer. A lot of restaurants will simply force the entree on you before you have a chance to digest the appetizer. Not here. They are fast with their service, but not pushy. My friend got the butternut squash ravioli, a dish they've come to be known for. And with good reason. Even with a cream sauce, it was light and incredibly flavorful. I had the shrimp and scallops over linguine with Giacomo sauce, which is a red sauce with a little cream and pepper. Perfection. I was all ready to bring some home, but couldn't stop eating! It is a little cramped in the restaurant so you're most likely sitting on top of your neighbor and often have to scoot your chair here and there, but it really adds to the dining experience. The people who eat here always seem to be excited to eat here and truly enjoy the whole experience.

Well....we read so many good reviews of this place on here, that it was our first stop when we headed up to Boston back in September for the Yankees/Soxs series. It was a quick walk from our hotel. First off, I hadn't been to Boston in forever and when I walked into the North End I immediately fell in love. We hiked over to Giacomo's--surprise! No line! (I think the fact that we went at 5:30 helped...there was a line when we left!)The place was packed, but they seated us right away. Everyone was super, super friendly. We each ordered a glass of wine and then had the calamari to start--YUM! I've only have calamari at one other place that was this good--and it was just this past weekend. I ordered the lobster ravioli with the red sauce..oh.my.god. So freakin' good. We knew the place was cash only....but unfortunately the people next to us did not and were wondering what they were going to do. Luckily, they were able to sneak out to an ATM.Yes, this place is small and crowded, but the food is to die for and you can make \"friends\" with the people eating next to you!

The Caesar salad was without a doubt one of the best, if not THE best, Caesar salad to ever touch my palate. \u00a0The freshest of Romaine and the dressing was absolutely devine (I wondered if they made it the authentic way with the raw egg?). \u00a0 I hate to say it, but I can't remember the exact name of the entree I chose, but it was the fuscilli with lobster (ahhh, but they put lobster on EVERYTHING in New England, don't they, and it's so to-die-for!!) and some other kind of seafood with the lobster sauce. \u00a0The serving was HUGE (so my brother back in Arlington was quite happy with my left-overs!). \u00a0The lobster was fresh and wonderful, but the fuscilli, while I liked it, was a bit too pasty and heavy for my liking. \u00a0I consider myself to be a pretty good Italian cook, but have never taken it to the extent of making my own pasta, so this may be why I found their pasta to be a little overwhelming in that it seemed to dominate the entire dish, whereas the sauce and seafood, in my opinion, should have been the dominant flavors.All in all, would I return here? \u00a0Hmmm, I'd consider it, but since I have sooooo many other restaurants to try in the North End, it'd be a very long time before I got back to this one a second time.", "Date": "2010-09-12", "Author_Location": "Long Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Mark O.", "ReviewID": "pUjkKcv7nXRL2zPpDi1EOQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ate here a few days ago on a strong recommendation from a friend - had the calamari red, wife had linguine with seafood. \u00a0Sauce was good but was strictly 'slightly above average', wife felt the same way. \u00a0Both agreed that my at-home recipe was better.Going out for Italian is hard - the food really has to be extraordinary to be worth it. \u00a0Giacomo's is good but they don't seem to go the extra mile, particularly when using boxed Barilla pasta. \u00a0Boxed pasta in the North End? \u00a0That's close to sacrilege.Relatively, there is some value- \u00a0the wine is not out of this world pricing and entrees are average. \u00a0But would have to agree with others that Giacomo's is not worth a special trip to the North End.", "Date": "2010-09-13", "Author_Location": "Arlington, MA"}, {"Author": "Alana T.", "ReviewID": "1Ck8_1Vo_7MZaEfWZpVS_A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Food was fantastic, but I disagree that its a good place for a date.

The calamari scampi was the best out of all, it was the most flavorful. The fra diavolo was pretty bland and could have been more spicy; and the pesto sauce was watery.

My idea of a quality dining experience is not waiting out in the cold for an undetermined amount of time and then being squeezed into an unbelievably tight space and literally rubbing elbows with your neighbor diners. For a place that serves $15-26 dishes, I shouldn't have to read the menu off the *wall* or on stained and/or sloppy hand-written menu. For a bottle of wine priced at $20-something, I shouldn't see a fourth of a cup of wine splashed on the table after the waitress dumps the wine into my glass (although at least she had my friend try the wine before she poured the other glasses... although I doubt if \"Try this\", spoken in a surly tone, is the traditional way of presenting a wine to a patron). When expecting to have a bill of about $100, I shouldn't have a waitstaff that can hardly, well, wait for you to make up your mind about the menu. And after all that... the long wait, the hurried meal, the humorless waitress... my friend got food poisoning from what we figure must have been the scallops.

I am very picky about atmosphere, service, and obviously quality of the food, and I have to say that this was one of the best meals I have ever had. We started off with the mussels in pesto sauce with garlic bread (a must for wiping up the delicious sauce) and then split the lobster ravioli (unreal). The prices were very reasonable for a North End Boston meal and our server was very friendly. The food came out very quickly. It is a small place and there is always a line down the street to get in (we arrived at 4:20ish so as not to wait in line and were outside by 5). The only downside is the rushed feeling of in and out you get from waiting, sitting down, eating, and then leaving. They really need to keep things moving in order to accomodate the customers outside who really want a bite! But, if you are in the mood for an incredible meal and do not mind the wait followed by a fast paced dining experience Giacomo's has to offer, then you should definitely check it out. It is well worth the experience for your taste buds alone.

Generally uniform rave reviews here on yelp, the restaurant guide book, Zagat, gives it high marks and there's ALWAYS a line out front. So why did I leave tonight thinking this was just an average place? I arrived just after it opened (5:00 pm) so I was seated right away. If you want to avoid the nightly line, go early. The menu serves your basic Italian staples. Parmigianas, Marsalas, ravioli, etc. For the shellfish and linguine dishes, you have a choice of 5 sauces to choose from. Nothing to fancy. Portions are generous. My server, Rose, was polite and efficient. I've noticed many reviews comment on being rushed through their meal. I did not get that feeling but perhaps that was because it was just after the restaurant opened and there wasn't a line of people out front waiting to be seated. After placing my order, I was served some unimpressive bread. No butter, no accompaniments. There looked like what appeared to be a bottle of EVOO on my table for dipping the bread but since I had no dish to pour the liquid onto, I can't say for sure. Based on recommendations here on yelp, I started out with the fried calamari. It was good but personally, I think that Nico, just a few doors down the street does it much better. I then had the Frutti De Mare (scallops, shrimp, calamari, mussels and clams) served over linguine and I chose the scampi sauce. Again, it was good but no better or worse than what you can get at any number of other restaurants in the North End and certainly not worth waiting in line for. A couple of things to note: there are only 13 tables (guess they're not superstitious) and they're set very close to one another so private conversations are out of the question. It's also \"cash only\" however prices are reasonable (and there's an ATM across the street for those unaware). As I left the restaurant, I saw that the inevitable line had formed. Hope they thought it was worth the wait....but I doubt it. Moderately recommended as long as there's no line.

We waited for an hour for dinner tonight (Sunday night) and it was completely worth it. The line was around the corner but luckily the people around us were funny and friendly so time passed by a bit faster. It is quite a small place and alot of the tables were so close that you were sharing tables with other groups but we lucked out and had the best seats in the house (right at the bar but it's only built for two). Since we were a party of two, we were seated ahead of at least four other groups (of 3 and larger). We were able to watch the cooks making all of the wonderful dishes. Also try the Italian beer, Peroni. Never had or even heard about it before today and I have never had a beer like it so it's hard to describe. So back to the food...the lobster ravioli was yummmmmy. It was not fishy tasting at all and the sauce it was in was creamy and delicious. It tasted completely fresh and for 14.95, I call it a bargain. The fusilli was perfectly al dente but my veggies were so finely chopped I could barely find them. Pretty much all of the entrees were pretty reasonably priced. It is a small place so unless you have lots of patience (especially on the weekends) and time wait it out; it is definitely a gem in the North End.
