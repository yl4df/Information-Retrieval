EVER !! I was so surprised at the complete neglect from a restaurant of this caliber.Granted.. my wife and I made a mistake, and originally showed up for our reservation under dressed. (we weren't notified of the strict dress code at the time of making a reservation) The ma\u00eetre' d agreed to hold our reservation as my wife and I went back to the hotel for more appropriate attire. Upon our return we were seated immediately, and our server Gabriel greeted us promptly. Gabriel made a special note to let us know that due to the mix-up with dress code he had been instructed to take extra special care of us for our stay. From there... that was pretty much the last time we saw Gabriel. He took our drink orders.... And it took about 20 minutes to receive the coffee and my wife's coke. We had our amuse-bouche before our drinks came to the table.(and they weren't even brought to us by our server) Once we received our drinks Gabriel took our orders and that was the last we saw. We never received our bread..... my wife's drink sat empty for scores at a time... in fact we had to flag down a runner to get someone to bring us a refill. Gabriel came to check on us during the salad course, and we asked for our bread at that time.. Gabriel apologized and said he'd bring it \"immediately\"... and we are still waiting for it. We never received the side dish we ordered... it was almost comical. From that point he never came to check on us at all. Not to see how things were... not to ask if there were anything we needed... not to refill a drink..... NOT once !!!! The next time we saw Gabriel was when he brought us our check. The funny part is.. when he noticed my wife and I discussing the bill he quickly came to the table to make sure everything was ok ! We politely informed him all was well... signed for our check... and his $3 tip... and left.Again.. the food was delicious, had we received proper service, I might have considered a 5 star rating. The restaurant is old school NOLA at its best! Unfortunately, the service we received was absolutely ABISMAL !!!! My wife and I would laugh as we noticed all the other servers being attentive tending to their tables, as our Gabriel was nowhere to be found. Especially since he made it a point to express to us that he will make sure our stay is \"everything wed hope it to be at Commanders Palace\" Sorry Gabriel, we won't be back!!!", "Date": "2014-07-17", "Author_Location": "Belvidere, IL"}, {"Author": "Emily T.", "ReviewID": "WEVkQxUlY-NmnjKLbssnFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Beautiful. It truly felt like we were wealthy for this evening. We got dolled up since it was our last night in NOLA, and we were ready for an upscale evening. That is what we got.This place obviously prides itself on outstanding service, and we definitely got that. From someone opening our taxi door to never seeing my wine glass empty, service was spot on.I' m not too sure how often the menu changes, as it seems like some of the dishes are more classic french and old-timey than your more modern locally-sourced restaurants that I am used to. But hell, for the one time we were here what we got was delicious. Rich, creamy, filling. In NOLA I'm not sure why you'd expect anything else. I had a pecan encrusted fish with crab on top. Oh man. It was a little salty for my liking but otherwise was to die for. My blueberry salad was also delicious. Dessert, the bread puddings. So unique, so good. Only not giving four stars because of the saltiness of all of the dishes, and because of the bread situation (in this fancy restaurant you're supposed to rip the bread yourself and get crumbs everywhere or?).

My sweet BF took me there for my birthday dinner, so it was a meal that we both really wanted to be special and memorable, and it was. From the moment we walked up to the Commanders entrance, every single staff member greeted us with smiles and warmth. More often than not, upscale restaurants can be a little stuffy and overly formal, but that was not the case here. Service was attentive and friendly without being stiff. We ordered the tasting menu (the \"chef's playground\") with the wine pairings. What a treat! The softshell crab was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the beef was perfectly cooked, and all the wines complimented each dish perfectly. Each course was perfectly spaced out enabling us to enjoy lots of dishes over several hours, without ever feeling rushed or stuffed-to-the-gills. On a bizarre side note, hours and hours later that night, we randomly ran into our waiter at Tipitinas. We thanked him again for the meal and he was just as congenial and \u00a0sweet as he had been at the restaurant. He really seemed to have a lot of respect for the restaurant and the customers, which I thought was pretty cool. For my BF and I, a meal at Commanders is a huge splurge and something that we probably wont be able to do again for many, many years.

Not only was the food fantastic, but the service by our incredible wait staff of Lorenzo and Esther was top notch. The service is \"a' la russe\" or Russian style, whereas the food is delivered and set on the table at the same time. This is key, because once the food is set down, the staff then tells you all at the same time what you are about to eat - really adding excitement to the whole experience. My friend and I agreed that we would do the Chef's 7 course tasting meal along with the wine pairing and what a coup that was (my motto is, if they took the time to pair things up for me, why do I even need to look at the menu?) \u00a0And let the feast begin!The food was just incredible. \u00a0Dishes complimented with caviar or small bits of diced onion - all in the right portion size to burst in your mouth at the right time, and not overpower the other flavors involved in dish. \u00a0 AND, I was able to eat Foie Gras - I was in heaven.Service: \u00a0I have been in the service industry my entire life in some capacity whether in the kitchen, bar, or serving customers, so I have a good idea what \"great\" customer service involves. \u00a0Let's just say - I wasn't disappointed. \u00a0You know when you are at a restaurant, and sometimes you turn around to look for your waiter, and ask for something as simple as more water? \u00a0But often times, the restaurant you are at has wait staff which rarely acknowledge your existence - even when you look right at them. \u00a0NOT the case with Lorenzo and Esther - I turned around once, just to look at the decorations of the room, and Lorenzo immediately came by and ask \"sir, was there something I can get you?\" \u00a0Simply amazing. You can find places with good food, and some with excellent wait staff, \u00a0but in my opinion, it is always difficult to find both.What we though would be a 2 hour meal turned into 3, and before we knew it we closed the place. \u00a0But lucky us, we got to tour the restaurant, and the wine cellar. \u00a0Big kudos to Commander's Palace for such an excellent meal, and thank you to Lorenzo and Esther for making our visit such a pleasant one. \u00a0We WILL be back, and this time we are having full glasses of \"Saint 75\".", "Date": "2014-06-06", "Author_Location": "San Mateo, CA"}, {"Author": "Caroline B.", "ReviewID": "kVI85hJ_yWlxZ5szEZdwcw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything I hoped it would be! \u00a0I would've given the place 5 stars, however when we first arrived it took about 5-10 minutes before we got water and drinks and our table was right at the top of the stairway so it wasn't ideal. \u00a0But other than that, everything was perfect. \u00a0We each ordered off the 3 course menu and were completely shocked at the portions for the price. \u00a0For less than $40 I got a delicious spinach salad, shrimp and grits and a PLATE SIZE CREME BRULEE! \u00a0That is completely unheard of in Washington, DC. \u00a0Every morsel was delicious and I will definitely eat here every time I am in town", "Date": "2014-07-16", "Author_Location": "Gaithersburg, MD"}, {"Author": "Rosie W.", "ReviewID": "HGMej7o_lpv3aBERPDb_aw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Years ago, one of my corporate overlords made me take a personality test. \u00a0The nickname for my particular combination of extrovert, thinking, blah blah blah was called The Colonel. \u00a0I didn't consider that a compliment. \u00a0Anyway, The Commander and I likely share some bossy personality traits. \u00a0And to thank the Mr. for putting up with said traits for 7 years (in a row!), we decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary at Commander's Palace.And it was just the most genteel, hospitable, special, delicious, fancy experience. \u00a0I doubt I'll forget it. \u00a0Some of the highlights included a yummy cocktail in the lush garden before dinner, beautiful, fresh fish with surprisingly modern accompaniments, amazing strawberry shortcake dessert (I do declare it gave me the vapors!), the owner coming by to wish us a Happy Anniversary... \u00a0It was absolutely everything a fine dining experience should be, with a dash of southern charm thrown in for an exotic touch, at least for a couple of Cali kids like us.And since I'm a SUCKER for signs, I have to point out that theirs is especially darling.If you're lucky/tolerant/lazy enough to stay married for a while, this is a fine place to honor the milestone and be inspired to keep up the good work.", "Date": "2014-05-22", "Author_Location": "Oakland, CA"}, {"Author": "James P.", "ReviewID": "Yvk5ItOQq685jhOnRTIQ6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Flawless meal meal...top notch service.

The table that fits 8, had a giant plate on it per person as well as a small plate and whatnot. I think they could have done without the giant plate.The bread here was amazing. The garlic bread was just so soft and crispy at the same time. Each bite flaked the garlic off the bread and you're just drowning in buttery bliss. With that being said, do request more! They also give fresh french bread, but definitely not as good.I ordered the turtle soup and chose to split it with my girlfriend, a great decision. I think they messed up the order since we both received a full order. The waiter offered sherry with the soup and I gladly accepted only to realize how strong the sherry is. It was just overwhelming to the soup. I already could not make the flavor of the turtle but the sherry definitely overpowered it. I wasn't too impressed.I also ordered the Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish which was spectacular. The crust was just right and the fish ever so tender. The sauce was just as I would hope for and the crab was just a nice touch, although seemingly extraneous.For dessert I was able to try the souffle and the strawberry shortcake. Both were good, however I wasn't a fan of the whisky sauce on the souffle - the bitterness fell through.Overall a solid restaurant, however very touristy and expensive.

I ordered the soup due jour and sausage stuffed shrimp with 5 pepper jelly and my friend ordered the salmon flat bread and gumbo. We also decided to share an order of the praline foie gras. After ordering, the servers presented us a plate of this delicious cheesy garlic bread that melted in your mouth. A few minutes after, in came the soup and gumbo. It tasted alright, nothing too special. Later the shrimp sausage and salmon flat bread. The shrimp tasted alright, like it was tossed in buffalo wing sauce and there was a piece of sausage stuck to every one. The jelly was pretty good too. Nothing that wowed me though. The toppings on the flat bread was delicious! The whipped cream cheese, juicy mandarin, fried capers, fresh dill, smoked salmon tasted fantastic together but the actual flat bread definitely could've tasted better. It tasted like a piece of cardboard to me. Finally the foie gras came around. This was my first time having foie gras. I loved it! It was glazed with a sweet and crispy outside and soft melt in your mouth inside. It came with a few pieces of this what seemed to be burnt fried dough I didn't care much for.

This time, we got to walk through the kitchen (I loved that), through the courtyard, and into the next dining room. Our server Chris took care of us. He was friendly and did his job with grace.25-cent martini specials during lunch, can you beat that?! I started with a vodka martini, dirty, while the other ladies had Cosmopolitans and a Melon. Warm garlic bread and butter delivered to the table while we decided what to order. Our server was explaining the menu and sold us on the Shrimp &Tasso Henican appetizer. We just wanted a taste for the table. It typically comes w/ 3 shrimp, they kindly added a 4th so we could all have one. Get this appetizer! It's shrimp, tasso ham, pickled okra and onion with a hot sauce beurre blanc. Do yourself a favor and take the regular warm French bread they also bring out and soak up that beurre blanc, fantastic! I opted for the 2 course lunch special and started with the Turtle soup. Commander's does this so well! When they come to the table, pour the cup in your bowl, and start to top it with the sherry...tell them light sherry. You just need a little or it will over power the deep taste of the soup. Also had the Parmesan Crusted Oyster Salad...I know it's a salad right? But, no, no it is not just a salad. It is 2 heads of romaine with a plethora of fried oyster goodness. Plus we all wanted to get something different so we could taste. I would totally order this salad again and enjoy it. The Tuscan Grilled Chicken was ordered by 2 and the Citrus Seared Gulf Fish was ordered by another. The fish was lovely, the chicken....not great really. It was found to be too salty to be completely enjoyable. That's a shame.

It's located in front of Lafayette Cemetery where a lot of tv shows and movies have been made. There are two dining room floors and we were seated upstairs. The interior resembles a southern home-cozy and inviting. Chatter and laughter all around us felt just like dining with family. There was no pretentiousness. No stuffy servers. Instead everyone was friendly and attentive which made us feel comfortable right away. So not what I expected from such a fine establishment. Our server went over the menu and answered any questions we had. He gave us recommendations as to their most popular dishes. We already knew what we wanted to order, but also ordered the turtle soup based on his recommendation. We ordered the stuffed quail, foie gras with beignets and cafe au lait, oyster absinthe, and strawberry shortcake for dessert. The quail is deboned and stuffed with yumminess. The foie gras and cafe au lait were a perfect combo. The oyster absinthe was also delish. I didn't really care for the turtle soup, but it had good flavor. I would highly recommend the quail. The strawberry shortcake (biscuit) felt light and refreshing. I don't need to tell you about the martinis again. Can't beat $.25 for one at lunch!

As adventurous eaters as we are we decided to try their turtle soup. It was topped off with a dry sherry. It was very different. The added sherry made the soup unexpected and unexplainable. For our main dishes my cousin ordered their gulf fish or red fish, crusted with pecans. She was really disappointed that it was like she was forcing herself to eat the meal because it was expensive. I, on the other hand had their winter mushroom risotto with shrimp. I took my first bite and I wanted to spit it out it was unbelievably salty. I tried a bite with the shrimp and it was still salty.

They started guiding us upstairs, and I was thinking they were going to hide us in a corner somewhere and rush us out.. I couldn't have been more wrong. They brought us into a lovely garden dining room. I asked for a table by the window, but was politely informed that they were all reserved. Perfectly understandable. We must have timed it just right, as 20 minutes later the place was packed. Now, \u00a0the Commander's, along with quite a few other places in NOLA, offers .25 cent martinis at lunchtime. This made me very happy, as I am very fond of martinis. Our server David appeared and went over the few things on the menu that we weren't familiar with without being condescending or impatient in the slightest. We downed our second martini before ordering and had the third delivered promptly. I ordered the Cajun Nacho, which honestly is one of the tastiest things ever. Small chunks of perfectly rendered pork belly, beans and pork cracklins on top. The wife got the Commander's Romaine salad, which was a bit like a Caesar, but with pressed cooked egg, which made it almost like a creamy deviled egg dressing. Mixing a bit of that salad on the pork thinger was absolutely perfect.For entrees, the wife had some sort of pulled pork doo dah that was really good and I had the tournedos of beef, of which I cleared every single morsel from my plate. I'm not usually a dessert guy, but strawberry shortcake sounded too good to pass up - even out of strawberry season. I decided I needed a refreshing beverage to re-up my fading three -martini buzz, so I ordered a Pimm's Cup. I will tell you right here, that the taste combination of the two (probably along with my aforementioned buzz), brought tears to my eyes. My goodness, it was delicious. \u00a0The sugar crusted shortbread biscuit; the thick, almost buttery, whipped cream; the sweet and sour Pimm's... if a meteor had hit the building right at that moment, I would have died a perfectly happy man.Now, if the meal itself hadn't been enough, one of the servers named Eric kicked things over the top. I had previously given him a little bit of shit over his slightly disappointing tinfoil duck that he had returned the salad leftovers in. I told him about the impressive tinfoil sculptures from Montage in Portland. \u00a0Apparently he saw this as a challenge and returned with the wife's entree leftovers in the form of a HUGE fleur de lys.

We instantly ordered one of the $0.25 martinis (available at lunch M-F with the purchase of an entree). \u00a0There is a limit of 3 per person and the answer is yes - I drank 3 :)My fiance and I both ordered off of the two course lunch special menu. We were given a choice of three entrees and a soup or salad. I started off with the Hearts of romaine, grated Parmesan, pressed egg, housemade bacon, French bread croutons, shaved Gruy\u00e8re, and creamy black pepper dressing. I can say this salad was beyond any expectations I had going into it. The pressed egg and housemade bacon was a perfect companion to the dressing.He started off with the turtle soup, which was hands down the best turtle soup I have had. Sadly, as much as I love turtle soup - it does not love me at all so I could enjoy was a bite. Thank goodness I adored the salad or I would have had some major food jealousy. He ate every ounce of it and requested we put this on the rehearsal dinner menu as an option.For our main course, we both ordered Assiette of Pork - Housemade sausage, slow roasted pork shoulder, and spicy cochon de lait boudin with Brussells sprouts, Creole mustard, and smoky trotter jus. Again, we ate every ounce - it was delicious.My fiance's Dads meal stole the spotlight, Braised Duck \"Po-boy\" entr\u00e9e salad. It was so good that it my eyes rolled. The salad consisted of Covey Rise greens, smoked sweet onions, sultanas, dried cranberries, and fresh goat cheese with truffled triple cream brie on toasted Leidenheimer bread & a duck fat apple cider vinaigrette. Insanity on a plate.Instead of ordering dessert, we continued our drinking fest and were arm twisted into trying the fig limoncello.

Most restaurants offer some sort of fresh bread that may or may not be heavily buttered. They're all the same, right? Wrong. CP's garlic bread was truly outstanding. Very fresh, light, and perfectly seasoned. I could have eaten an entire loaf of it. Skipping this because \"you're paleo\" should be a felony. I was not at all a fan of the gumbo. Very light on ingredients and more of a soup. More sweet than spicy, and the roux was too dark for how little else was in the bowl. Very disappointing. I ordered the Colorado lamb, which was a 17oz. lamb shank over Creole mustard crushed new potatoes with autumn roots, toasted grains, and rich roasted lamb bone jus r\u00f4ti. Best lamb I've ever had. Even better than some shanks I had in Iceland. The dish is very large, so order only if you're splitting it with someone else or you're very hungry. A friend ordered the duck, and it was cooked perfectly to medium rare. 99% of restaurants overcook duck, so this was a nice surprise. The Lally's praline parfait had a ton of whipped cream / custard, but it was exceptional. Possibly the only whipped cream I've ever wanted to eat by itself.

As a New Orleanean, it was always my go-to celebration restaurant for dinners, but also my favorite treat-yourself-to-lunch place when I needed some me time (some women get manicures, I want a martini alongside my shrimp & grits!) And oh the shrimp & grits! I moved away for school and I have *dreamed* of the shrimp & grits! So creamy with their goat cheese, but still fluffy a heavenly pillow for those fat, delicious shrimp to rest their buttery heads. I'm salivating! Nothing in the world compares[Over the summer], I brought a friend home with me and one of my few demands was to have lunch at Commander's Palace so that my tongue could remember bliss once more! I ordered without looking at the menu, my meal was even better than I'd remembered! And then this lovely woman came in to check on us and I told her of my love of these grits, how they were a symbol of home to me, a physical representation of bliss, the epitome of deliciousness! And you know what she did? She had my waiter (whose name I shamefully cannot recall, the grits overshadowed all else) bring me a free side of MORE GRITS! That's when I learned she was the owner, and probably the incarnation of an angel. I ate grits until I couldn't fit another single grit into my body, and the gluttonous pain of it was completely worthwhile. I don't know when next I'll get home to visit, my schedule is punishing & I'm trying desperately to take extra classes when I can in the hopes of moving home sooner than later.

So I was exciting to be going and looked forward to it all day. We could only get a 9:15pm reservation. Upon arrival Robert (who seemed to me to be the head waiter) was on it. However, shortly after we were left with Dina. Now, I don't want to say anything bad about her BUT I think she is one of the younger staff members and still in training. I felt after reading all the great reviews on service here I was really in for a great experience. I got that feeling when Robert was around. Ok I know 9:15 is late to start a dinner but that is the time they gave us. I felt as if we were being rushed the whole meal. Ordering dessert at the same time as dinner to start with. What the hell is that about? And it took 20 minutes to get the dessert there after dinner. How long does it take to pull a creme brulee out of the fridge sprinkle sugar on it and torch? I will say that the food was really great. I had the lamb and it was cook perfectly. Very tender right down to the bone. The turtle soup was a highlight that night with all of our guest. That is the reason for four stars.I am going to turn my attention but to Dina. She did keep the wine glasses and water full. As some of the guest were finishing dinner she called out from one end. (We had a large table in the center of the downstairs.) She said \"anyone want coffee?\"I had not finished my dinner so I kept eating. After I finished dinner my plate was removed. In the long wait for dessert I asked Dina for a cup of regular coffee. She immediately told me she has already asked the table. Then a couple of others spoke up and asked for coffee. She then said \"well, I hope they haven't dumped it out\"Really? Then she made a point to walk over to a waiter turn in our direction and in a tone we could clearly hear. Said \"I can't believe they are asking for coffee I already asked the table. Can you believe that.\" And then walked away. Seriously, I really don't care if you have to make another pot of coffee but don't ruin my dining experience because it's Friday night and you have got a party to go to. I got a cup of coffee. And then watch the table next to us get offered coffee. They were served promptly. However, I was never offered a refill. In the time I had dessert Dina was talking to Robert she explained all the side work she had done. He and another waiter contemplated and told her she was cut. To this she let out a little woo-hoo. I only wish her joy had been placed into serving us. I have to say that you never know who is watching you. While I sat in front of my empty coffee cup she brought the check. I paid and we were never spoken to again until we passed the front door and a host said good night. Out on the street there was a wedding party waiting on cabs. We were told they were getting the first cabs and it would be easier for us to walk to the trolley. So we did. I really wanted to feel all the love of the service everyone is talking about.

My husband had the turtle soup, quail, and bread pudding souffle with a mimosa. \u00a0My cocktail was delicious; it was both sweet and tart, with a little kick but not an overwhelming alcohol flavor. \u00a0I would order it again.The pain perdue was my favorite part of the meal. \u00a0It would be tempting to ask for an entree sized portion. \u00a0I'm normally a purist when it comes to french toast (butter, maple syrup, and that's it) but this blows that out of the water. \u00a0It has a spicy orange sauze drizzled over it and some tangy soft cheese inbetween, with some satsuma wedges. \u00a0I wanted to lick the plate. \u00a0I did, in fact, dip french bread into the sauce remaining on the plate after I sucked down the pain perdue. \u00a0I have no shame and no class, sorry. \u00a0But this was delicious. \u00a0 5 stars all the way.I had a sip of the turtle soup -- it is good, it's just not my favorite soup. \u00a0Probably a 4 for me.The pecan crusted fish was very good; it's a sheepshead and very mild flavor, not fishy at all. \u00a0The crust is very light, not too crunchy and not heavy at all. \u00a0The dish has a soft creamed corn sauce around it. \u00a0I enjoyed this dish but I have to say, I expected some more spice to it. \u00a0It didn't have to be knock-me-down spicy, but I think it was actually too mild for me to call it perfection. \u00a0It's a 4 star dish to me.I had a taste of my hubby's quail and though I generally am not a poultry fan, I liked it quite a bit, probably better than the fish. \u00a0It had a maple flavor to it that worked very well with the bird. \u00a05 star dish.My ordering the cheesecake was a tactical error; \u00a0I ordered it based on Todd's description of how they make the cheese for it and I neglected to notice on the menu that it's coated in caramel. \u00a0It's coated in A LOT of caramel. \u00a0For most people this is no problem, but I just plain don't like caramel. \u00a0So I scraped the top off and gave it to my hubby, and then I ate some, and then I just traded desserts with him. \u00a0The cheesecake is phenomenal, don't get me wrong, and if you like caramel you absolutely should order it. \u00a0Caramel, to me, is just very bitter, and I know I'm in the minority here. \u00a0It's a 5 star dessert that just doesn't suit my personal quirks.The bread pudding souffle, however, had no such issues. \u00a0It was light and fluffy and super delicious. \u00a0The whisky sauce it comes with was sweet and creamy and (thank goodness) did not have a strong whisky flavor. \u00a0If not for the caramel, I probably would choose the cheesecake over the souffle, but only because I love cheesecake. \u00a0This is still a 5 star dessert.Next time I'm in town, I plan on trying a different entree and a different dessert.People rave about the shrimp tasso helican, and I do so want to try it, but I'm not sure I could skip the pain perdue. \u00a0I wonder if they'd look at me funny if I asked for an entree of the pain perdue?The jazz band came by right as our entrees were arriving, they were great and asked if we had any requests; \u00a0I generally don't make requests as I don't want to be that annoying person who asks for the song that they are SO SICK OF PLAYING so I just asked them to surprise me, and they played Hello Dolly by Louis Armstrong. \u00a0We could still hear them just fine as they moved through the restaurant playing for others. \u00a0We counted \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" at least twice, so I felt very good about not making a request...you gotta figure they are sick of that song by now!", "Date": "2013-11-04", "Author_Location": "Arlington, TX"}, {"Author": "Sasha B.", "ReviewID": "Bqwonz5dnbytdX0pxwULbg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am very mixed about my dinner experience at Commander's Palace.

If the service is so great, why wasn't the table preprepared? The most awful garlicky bread wasdelivered as, what? Amuse bouche? It was so chewy and falsely seasoned, I was actually shocked. No fresh herbs? There is a way to make bad bread taste good. They didn't. Then the amuse bouche arrived. Server had to read from the cheat sheet. When a visible item on the plate was mentioned and I asked about it, server didn't know. Lighting was dark at table so I couldn't see, but after tasting, realized it was a radish slice. Really? Server couldn't ID radish?!Then some bread 'grandly' arrived, delivered by a manager type who pronounced it as fresh from the kitchen. Duh. Though warm, in a napkin, UNCUT, with no knife, it too was awful bread. I don't mind tearing bread. Even if it's bad bread. But in a joint which thinks it's fancy, diners shouldn't have to tear their own bread. Though the butter was soft and salted. Lobster ravioli was fine. Not exciting, but fine. Romaine salad could not be salvaged even with three wedges of requested for lemon. It was bland and very lame. The recommended bread pudding was very pedestrian. Guess it was that lame bread. Sauce was overly sweet, unnuanced, \u00a0with a raw bourbon bite. So the food was not good. The service, which is not responsible for the food, was not remedied by a host who offered a dark napkin rather than the set white after noting my black dress.

I was in New Orleans for my friend DNK's bachelorette party. I live under a rock, so I didn't know that New Orleans is known for their food. I mean I assumed we would eat some grits and some craw fish, but I didn't know the extent of culinary wonderment and thrills I would soon encounter. So. I was told to \"pack a nice dress, we are having a classy brunch\". But then someone else told me the place we are eating at has 25 cent martinis and I was all \"HAHA - THAT'S NOT CLASSY!\" and kept thinking my friends were a bunch of jokesters. But I follow directions fairly well and packed a brunch appropriate outfit and you know what? Never once bothered to look up, Yelp, Google or ask around about Commander's Palace. When we arrived, the place was packed. I'm talking every single table full. The interior was cool, like a sort of formal French inspired layout with some gold and obviously fleur de lis wallpaper - expected, but still nice. We were taken upstairs to this room that was just floor to ceiling glass walls which was so very pretty due to the lovely overgrown garden view. Really casual cool, something about it was just so...well...New Orleans, which totally makes sense. We of course ordered martini's (I went with a Cosmo, delish, very well made, not too sweet) and then lunch. Someone ordered turtle soup I want to say, or something else totally strange - but I think it was the bride to be's fault, in which case, we all had to try it. I just don't love the consistency, but the flavors? True dat. I also had the - Surprise, Surprise - French Onion Soup, because I felt like that was a necessary part of the meal. Delicious. Really, really excellent in a classic, exactly how you expect it to taste sort of way. \u00a0I went with the Louisiana Shrimp & Grits as my entree, because you know, when in Rome and all that jazz.

I don't know why I didn't expect it to be ridiculous, considering it's a famous staple of New Orleans and has won all these awards and produced all these amazing chefs...mercy. I just didn't know. Like I said before? I come from under a rock. It was the best damn meal. Literally second only to Jules Verne in Paris (in the Eiffel Tower).

White shrimp over goat cheese stone ground grits with melted onions, leeks, roasted mushrooms, concasse tomatoes and sauce forestiere? If you don't love the sound of this, we are probably not even friends, which is fine, because more for me. I'll drink your martinis, too.

If you go during the day, the bright light blue building stands out quite nicely, but inside, it has a very homey feel to it, particularly with the staircase upstairs and the separate rooms that make it feel like you are eating in a very large house. The service here is pretty solid overall, with a very friendly (and knowledgeable) wait staff there to help you enjoy your meal.The food is a great reflection of New Orleans, with the Cajon and Creole influences aplenty on the menu items. We started out with the 3 soup sampler, which is reasonable - you get 3 different soups, 2 of which are classic NO (gumbo and turtle soup), along with the soup of the day (which was a cauliflower soup when we came). All of the soups were really good; both the gumbo and the turtle soup had the strong, distinctive flavor that makes them so delicious. However, the sherry that was added to the turtle soup was a bit unnecessary and was more than I would have preferred. We then split the crispy oysters and pork belly, which was just a great dish - very succulent belly, and a large fried oyster on top. Eating both of them in one bite is a must; even though I've never really had oysters and pork together, the combination of a plump oyster and the rich, fatty pork belly works so well together. I ended up going with the pecan-crusted fish (it was sheepshead that day, which I had never even heard of), and what a good choice that was - the pecans are a bit caramelized, giving the fish a slightly sweet flavor, along with the great crunchy texture of crisped nuts. The crab that's served alongside it is also really good, but the broth that the fish is cooked in is just amazing - you could probably put anything in it and it would taste great. My fiancee went with the porcini-rubbed veal, which was very well-executed - porcini is a mushroom with a very strong, aromatic flavor, but it was a very light rub so that you could taste the quality and the cut of the meat itself (which, done at medium rare, is the right amount to cook it).We were stuffed by the time we came to dessert (probably not the best idea to house the whole loaf of bread they bring over), but we had to do it because of all the high praise for the bread pudding souffle. There's not much to say about it that hasn't been said - it's not that dense, and the whiskey cream adds that hint of alcohol that mixes really well with the sweetness. The strawberry shortcake (which we also got) was absolutely delicious as well - the buttermilk biscuits are done in proper Southern fashion, and the strawberries are sweetened just the right amount to taste delicious with the biscuit and whipped cream.In all - a very cool dining experience (and very filling). The entire meal was delicious, and their drinks are well-executed too (I had two cocktails - one a little sweeter, one a bit heaver on the bourbon, and both were done perfectly).

Fortunately we were able to make it work on the final day of our New Orleans weekend.For brunch, there is no real a la carte dining. When you choose an entree, the price comes with an appetizer and dessert. Within the menu, they do a \"Jazz Brunch Special\" with their more popular appetizer, entree and dessert along with their famous Bloody Mary. While the price is a bit cheaper, since there was four of us, we wanted to try some different items as well as not get locked in with the choices from the special.After ordering, they brought out some delicious, hot and crusty, garlic bread for the table. So much garlic, tons of butter, but I could have eaten the whole plate! To be polite, I did share with everyone else at the table. :)To start, Adam ordered a Bloody Mary. What I love about New Orleans is that a Bloody Mary always comes with pickled vegetables. Both Adam and I love anything pickled and find pickles the best add-on to a Bloody Mary. The one at Commander's Palace came with pickled okra and a cherry pepper. I had a sip and thought it was quite good. Adam definitely enjoyed it and ordered another after finishing off the first.I was in the mood for something more on the sweet side and Adam recommended a Milk Punch. I had never heard of a Milk Punch and was intrigued to try it. Milk Punch is a drink that is common in New Orleans and consists of milk, brandy or bourbon, sugar, and vanilla extract. Usually, nutmeg is also sprinkled on top. I enjoyed it, though I found it quite sweet.Adam started off with the Turtle Soup, which is definitely one of Commander's Palace's most famous dishes. The soup had a dark roux, chunks of turtle and veal and some small perfectly cooked pieces of onion, bell pepper and celery. Due to the roux, it was more like a stew than a soup, but the flavor was fantastic! Like a lot of \"exotic\" meats, the turtle tasted similar to chicken. The soup had a kick that was really nice and a rich beef flavor from the stock.Since Adam got the Turtle Soup, I decided to get the gumbo. The gumbo changes daily and, on the day we were there, it was a chicken and mushroom gumbo. I love gumbo and I love mushrooms, so I couldn't be happier when the gumbo came to the table. I wasn't disappointed. There were chunks of chicken and mushroom in the gumbo and the dark roux brought everything together.Adam decided to get the Louisiana blue crab and crawfish frittata (Local blue crab, Breaux Bridge crawfish, mizuna, torched shallots, Creole baby tomatoes, wild mushrooms and Laura Chanel goat's cheese with white truffle oil), which I had also been eyeing. We were surprised when it came to the table and looked more like an egg patty with toppings on top. Usually a frittata has the items baked into the egg but Commander's Palace had them mostly resting on the top. Either way, Adam really enjoyed it since it had crawfish, mushrooms, and tomatoes - some of Adam's favorite foods - on it.So we could try something else, I got the Louisiana seafood boil (Spicy Breaux Bridge crawfish, Gulf shrimp, and local crab over a variety of crab boiled vegetables & house made andouille sausage with two poached eggs and brown butter hollandaise). The description didn't prepart me for what came to the table but I really loved their interpretation of a seafood boil. The brown towers was a fried patty of the crawfish, shrimp and crab and they were fried perfectly. The crab boiled vegetables added some moisture to the dish as well as the poached eggs. For dessert, Adam got the Ponchatoula strawberry shortcake (First of the season sweet strawberries layered in a warm buttermilk biscuit with whipped chantilly cream and a dusting of powdered sugar). The biscuit was really soft and the strawberries were very sweet, a perfect \"light\" ending to the meal.After all of the rave reviews of the bread pudding, I couldn't leave without giving it a try and I definitely wasn't disappointed. While I don't eat a lot of desserts, this might have been one of the best souffl\u00e9s I've ever had. The souffl\u00e9 was so light and fluffy and the bread pudding was so moist. With the addition of the whiskey cream sauce tableside, it was SO good. I was concerned that with the sauce, it would be too sweet, but I found the souffl\u00e9 at the right level of sweetness for my taste. The whole table agreed that it was to die for.The Jazz brunch is definitely worth it. While a bit pricey, we found the portions very large, service very friendly and the jazz band would even take requests! Since there are two parts to the restaurant, there were lulls where we were able to carry on a conversation during the meal before the jazz band came back. I hate meals where you can't talk with your fellow diners so I really enjoyed that the jazz band didn't play the whole time.

They seated us immediately which was really great. \u00a0The space is gorgeous and was packed with diners. Our table was on the 2nd floor and right in front of the staircase, which was a bit busy with people and servers walking by all throughout our dinner. Here is what we ordered and how we enjoyed it1. \u00a0Crispy oysters and pork belly: \u00a0Oysters were fried perfectly, and citrus glazed pork belly cubes were delicious. \u00a0Best thing we ate.2. \u00a0Citrus salad and Caesar salad: I liked my citrus salad. It was well balanced with crunch of nuts. Caesar that my husband ordered was a bit heavily dressed for my taste, and was overly salted. It had great flavors from Gorgonzola cheese.3. \u00a0Shrimp and grits: \u00a0I was torn between this and cast iron fish, but I am still searching for the perfect southern shrimp and grits so had to try it. \u00a0While it was good, it didn't blow me away. \u00a0I also confused why they (anyone) leave the tail on the shrimp for this dish. With dark creole sauce, I rather not have pick up the shrimp or fight my knife to slice it. \u00a0Anyhow, it had good amount of andouille sausage. \u00a0Grits was creamy and had a good texture. It was salty again, probably heavy cajan seasoning on the shrimp. \u00a0They suggest a Chardonnay with this but I had a red burgundy which used to be paired with the dish before a change in wine menu, said the server. \u00a04. \u00a0Filet: my husband decided on this after considering the quail, which I wished he had picked. \u00a0Filet was cooked perfectly, but again didn't blow us away. \u00a0It was served on top of a potato and herb pur\u00e9e. \u00a0While it tasted fine, the color of pur\u00e9e was a funky green (think dyed beer for st pattys day). It didn't look appetizing at all. \u00a0He concluded that the steak was good but not $40 good. \u00a0That's how we felt about the dinner as whole. \u00a05.

As in, I was able to order dessert, that bread pudding, in fact. *That* bread pudding. And although bread pudding can also be a very ponderous (yet sweet and delicious) affair, Commander's makes theirs into a sensational souffl\u00e9, so that the initial bites are light and airy and heavenly, but you dig down a bit more and get to the \"meat\" of it, a not-terribly-sweet bread pudding.

The hubs ordered a Mint Julep and myself a sparkling water. Our order was identical for the food. We opted for the three course dinner which included a soup or salad, entree and dessert. We each ordered the turtle soup (their specialty!), Black Skillet Seared Gulf Fish and the infamous Creole Bread Pudding Souffle. If I could give more than five stars I would. This meal was absolutely impeccable. The portions, flavors, freshness and presentation were amazing. We were in food heaven. The servers moved gracefully through the room as if they were in some choreographed waltz. I don't think I've ever had better service before. Finally, our bill came and we were surprised to see how reasonable this meal cost us - $135 which included 25% tip. It was well worth it. I would have gladly paid double or triple.Lastly, I'd like to say as a \"yankee\" I can appreciate this type of restaurant. The south really knows how to put together a classy, delicious meal.

Sadly, I think that Commander's Palace is one of those places that coasts by on their decades-old reputation. People expect that they should love it, so they do. However, I found it tired and lackluster. On the surface, the service seems to be great. But in actually, I don't think it really is. Sure, they execute a very formal style of service, but that doesn't mean that they really pay attention to the diners' needs. Our server wanted to take our drink order without us having any menus or a wine list to look at. We waited forever to get said menus - despite flocks of servers all around us. My mom ordered hot tea and received a cup, a tea bag...and no hot water. Our water glasses were replaced half-way through the meal because \"the ice had melted too much.\" That is just stupid. I barely touched my entree, yet not a single server or staff person asked if anything was wrong with it (even when it was cleared away). So, they are clearly trained to do certain things, but they don't really pay attention to their customers. The gumbo was the worst I had ever had. Lumpy brown goo with a few shrimp in it. Sad. My mom's shrimp and grits were very good and we loved this dish. I got excited about the seafood boil. The dish actually comes out much different than it is described in the menu - not sure why the description is so misleading. Basically, it is shrimp, crab and fish made into large \"cakes\" (like a crab cake). This should have tasted amazing - unfortunately, the flavor was so off that neither of us could eat it. It had an extremely strong smokey flavor. I guess if you are a fan of that, you might like it, but we definitely did not.We went ahead and tried their \"signature\" dessert - the bread pudding souffle. It was okay. Not bad, but definitely not great and not sophisticated or modern by any means. And I just had to try the $0.25 martini - I should have known that for that price, it was going to be bad. It was. Terrible. Do yourself a favor and order a proper cocktail. The restaurant itself is best described as \"dusty.\" I get that its old, but it just seemed a little sad inside. It is in a gorgeous neighborhood - if you insist on having lunch here (and thank goodness we only wasted a lunch here and not dinner), do yourself a favor and walk around the beautiful neighborhood before or after your meal.

We made our dinner reservation online with a special request for a quiet private table for two, in hopes that we could get a booth away from big parties and noise. All in all, the dining room turned out to be pretty quiet, not just because we were seated at a beautiful round corner nook in the back of the first floor dining area.For drinks, we got the Sazerac Rye (the New Orleans classic) and the Crescent Cooler (a guava infused rum cocktail). My friend later finished off with a gin-based, intimidatingly named, Corpse Reviver. The drinks were clean and crisp.We had to try the 1-1-1 soup trio, which consisted of seafood gumbo, soup du jour (for us, it was chicken andouille gumbo (both gumbos came off a bit salty, but went excellently with the table bread) and turtle soup (my favorite of the three, I would've ordered it by itself). For $8.50, the teacup-sized sampling is a great tasting.The classic pecan crusted gulf fish ($34) was exquisite and my recommendation for your entree. The herb crusted rack of spring lamb ($45) we ordered medium-rare, and arrived on the rarer side of that; it's nice for rare lamb-meat lovers, but the best part was really the crust.Of course for dessert we had to get the famous Creole bread pudding souffle ($9.50).

My server asked me if I liked my martini, to which I replied \" it's not my favorite.\" Instead of asking how she could make my experience at Commander's better, she countered with, \" well it's 25 cents.\" Ok, so you're allowed to serve me crappy drinks because they're cheap? If I wanted a crappy meal I could've gone to McDonald's. I would think that an \"upper echelon\" restaurant like Commander's would want to put out a quality product, but over and over during this meal I was reminded that Commander's Palace is not actually a top tier restaurant.I haven't even started talking about the food. I started with the three- soup sampler. The gumbo was terribly salty, the turtle was passable, and the carrot, which was the best of the three, was more cream-flavored then carrot. For an entree, I got the quail with wilted greens and boudin, which wasn't bad, but should've been much better.

Think twice before you go here, and definitely read all the two star reviews!!!With that caveat, here are my excuses for this place, which really doesn't need my excuses!!!1. Commanders Palace is an institution. That being said, it runs three major review risks.....A. Special Occasion Diners. Many people choose an institution for the only nice (I.e. over 20$) meal they will eat. The expectations can get really overblown by this crowd who often come in a bit uptight and sincerely concerned about all that could go wrong on their special night. These folks are quickest to accuse this (or any)place, and (sometimes they are right) of living off of some by-gone reputation.B. Casual Diners. Commanders is old school. there is a dress code. If you are one who thinks, \"if I am paying that much for a meal, I ought to be able to wear my Rolling Stones T-shirt and my thong underwear on my head if I want to!\", you should go somewhere else.C. Exotic Diners. This place has some creative dishes, but you will not find the latest Asian-Italian fusion cuisine here. Just elegant, classic food.2. The food is wonderful. In addition to classic items like gumbo and shrimp and grits, you will also find special creations on the menu. I had a sweet potato and sausage soup that was one of the best soups I have ever eaten. 3. At lunch they have a martini special. If you order an entree, they will allow you up to three basic martinis for a quarter a piece. This is considered a deal in most parts.4. There are menu items that made Commanders famous. While the turtle soup and bread pudding souffl\u00e9 are delicious, ask the server for a newer concoction. 5. The service is excellent. If you eat here, have fun getting dressed up and plan for the meal to be an un-hurried delight.

Commanders rolls out the VIP by having all of it's currently un encumbered staff come and great you at the door. I had 40 people come up to me and say \"Hello, Welcome to Commanders Palace\". Very friendly. Many high end restaurants give you that snooty air but Southern Hospitality shows up here. Our waiter was the BOMB. Everyone knew him and liked him.(Chuck or Chris as I recall, sry too many hand grenades). It felt like he could read your mind the way he anticipated your questions and thought about your needs. I would've tipped 40% on our already sizable bill but unfortunately money is a thing so 25% is the best I could stretch.Appetizers. Foi Gras - warm, delicate, savory, oily. It was perfect with the house made bread. People that know and like Foi Gras will like it. If you're from California you need to take the opportunity to try this since it's illegal to sell in your state and don't ask why it's illegal in your state just enjoy. Presentation was beautiful, it came with raspberry, fruit and mint sauces in mardi gras colors as well as a tiny pina colada.Soups. We got a tasting platter of three soups: Turtle Soup, Gumbo and ??fish soup??(should've been sober). All good but that last fish like soup was the best. It reminded me of a vegetable based runny Alfredo with chewy chunks of fish. Get that soup without the two others in the tasting platter. I was your Guinea pig already, trust.Entrees. Crawfish, veal and grits. The grits base had a full mouth feel and truffle flavor. Crawfish and veal were cooked perfectly just to solidify the one and take out the pink blood out of the other. Desert. Bread pudding. The top layer was a light egg white that our waiter separated with a spoon to pour in a sweet white sauce. The middle to bottom had the tougher texture of bread.

Unfortunately our merry little crew had gone out a little too hard the night before and we all boarded the struggle bus towards Commander's.Although I started feeling better as soon as I walked in, the rest of our group was struggling. We were walked upstairs in the old mansion, which has a welcoming, Southern feel to it. There is an old school elegance about the entire restaurant, which we were able to tour after our meal was over. I practically died when I walked into the room upstairs that had walls made of floor to ceiling glass. Now, onto the food. Not being able to even think about ordering the quarter martinis we ordered bloodies instead. The were delicious and had a nice horseradish kick to them. We were also immediately served the house garlic toast and wow was it amazing. Buttery and perfectly toasted I knew this meal was about to get good. I started with the soup du jour which was a sweet potato and house-made andouille sausage puree. It was spicier than I had originally anticipated but complex in flavor. I continued on with one of my favorite cajun classics-shrimp and grits. The grits were creamy and rich while the shrimp was incredibly fresh. They also added a mushroom and vegetable sauce which added another unique layer of flavor to the dish. Yum!Although my dining companions did not want to order dessert, I basically convinced everyone that we must order it. The strawberries in the strawberry shortcake were perfection, while the biscuits were out of this world good. The star of the show was the bread pudding souflee. What a unique take on such a rich dish. Making it a souflee was a fun play on such a regional favorite.And to top it off?

I was pleased to see three balloons tied to our table when we arrived. But that, my friends, was the ONLY reference to my mom's birthday. Not even a free dessert for her. WHO DOESN'T DO THAT? Good GOD, the day before for my birthday lunch at Muriel's, I got a free dessert, my mom got a free dessert since her birthday was the next day, and my daughter got a free dessert because her birthday was coming up later that week. Commander's Palace...NOTHING.Yelp says the dress code is \"dressy,\" but it's actually business casual. Just no jeans or shorts.Service was formal...they'd try to place all entrees down at the same time, for example. But they orchestrated pretty well for the soup/salad course and then it fell apart for the entrees and desserts. And even though formal, the service was not friendly. I couldn't tell you my server's name. Zero personality. Zero attention to us as people.I had the gumbo and it was good, but nothing I'd recommend.Three of us decided to have the Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish, which is one of their \"always on the menu\" items. My mom and sister, who had both had pecan crusted white fish at Jacques-Imo the night before, both agreed that Jacques-Imo was much better.I finished with a bread pudding souffle, which was good. But by then, I was so irritated by the fact that they weren't doing anything for my mom's 75th that I was basically checked out.Compared to the personal service we had the day before at Muriel's and Jacques-Imos, Commander's Palace fell completely flat and the food wasn't good enough to pull its rank up any.

I recommend trying a spoonful or two of the soup first, THEN try it with the sherry.Seafood boil: I was not impressed with the seafood boil at all. \u00a0It tasted like a warm version of the seafood salad mix that they sell at Costco. \u00a0Granted, the seafood tasted fresh, however it tasted way too rich, as if it was drenched in either heavy cream or mayonnaise. \u00a0Blegh.I tried a piece of the quail that my friend ordered, and was much more impressed with his entree. \u00a0The quail was moist, tender, and had a slightly smokey taste to it. \u00a0Had I known better, I would have ordered that instead of my seafood boil.Dessert: My group of three shared the bread pudding souffl\u00e9 and strawberry shortcake. \u00a0Both were delicious and not overly sweet, though were still pretty sweet. \u00a0If I had to choose between the two, I'd opt for the strawberry short cake. \u00a0The cake was delicious-crispy around the edges and crumbly on the inside. \u00a0The souffl\u00e9 was like a bread pudding topped with a souffl\u00e9.The garlic bread that we started with along with the table bread were both very good. \u00a0The pasty chef is top notch!Finally, we also opted for the 25-cent martinis. \u00a0I would pass on those in the future and opted for a better quality drink. \u00a0You know for 25-cents, they must use the cheap vodka...I couldn't get past one or two sips. \u00a0I kept taking sips hoping that my martini would get better, but it did not. \u00a0I'll stick to my grey goose martinis in the future.Overall, Commanders Palace fell short on its hype. \u00a0There are better restaurants in town. \u00a0However, I can appreciate is historical value and can see how people can appreciate it as THE establishment within the New Orleans community.FYI: the restaurant is in a cute area of town called the Garden District. \u00a0It might be worth to stop by for a Mae if you are in the area checking out the gorgeous, historical homes that surround the restaurant.", "Date": "2013-03-18", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Mallards R.", "ReviewID": "ARfYaIMBPsSngR0NMqa4AQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great experience.

I've now dined here twice and both times did not disappoint. During my first visit, a group of us girls came here for Sunday brunch and we were lucky enough to be seated in the beautiful Garden Room. The place was tastefully decorated with colorful balloons that really makes your heart want to smile. And the jazz trio that went around to each table really added a nice touch to our experience. The second time around, my hubby and I came with another couple and I really wanted them to see the Garden Room, so I made a requested to be seated there... the hostess delightfully obliged. =)The menu consists of many choices and a pre-fixe (which comes with a soup or salad, main entree and a dessert) for a reasonable price. Whether you are a meat lover, a seafood person or vegetarian, there's something for everyone. \u00a0The first time, I ordered the blue crab stuffed flounder, which was superb. Feeling adventurous, we all decided to order the turtle soup to try and it was, to our surprise, tastier than it sounds! Sorry Squirt! Also the bread pudding you keep hearing about was just divine... ordered that, twice! I didn't love my second meal here as much as the first, but it might have been an off day. (I ordered the black skillet seared gulf fish from the pre-fixe menu).The service was just stellar and the entire experience itself was something to write home about. We also had the opportunity during our first visit to take a tour of the place where we were introduced to each dining area (I think there are 6-7 total), each one with its own unique charm. They also took us through the kitchen, the wine cellar, and the outside garden area. If it's not a busy time at the restaurant, I'd highly recommend requesting the tour!

Not only because of the awesome food and service but just the whole experience of dining there. CP was on my must-do list for NOLA but I was torn on when to go. Having only four days to fit in at least 12 meals was quite challenging. And this wasn't going to be just any meal. There was quite a bit of logistics involved with this one. For one, I had to get on a cable car and ride it into the Garden District which was a treat on its own. I got to see all the quaint, historical homes that the Amercians built outside the French Quarter as their way of competing with the French architecture just a few blocks away.I initially missed the stop that was closest to the CP so I rode the cable car all the way up and then back, which was no big deal since I didn't make a reservation. From the stop, CP is a few blocks away--perhaps a 5 minute walk. Across the street was an above-ground cemetery, an added bonus for me to see one of those.Initiailly, I was kind of intimidated. I watched people in suits and dresses being dropped off from taxis and fancy cars. The fact that it was inside a neighborhood made me feel like some kind of intruder. I totally hesitated and was kinda nervous to step inside.The moment I walked to the hostess stand and was warmly greeted--despite semi-touristy attire--I felt much more comfortable. I was sat right away on this Sunday evening, even though I was a walk-in. Oh, the benefits of solo travelling/dining. I opted for the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing cuz well, I was in NOLA and YOLO...and I didn't have to drive.Everything I had was very good, my only complaint was that the dry-aged breast of duck was extremly chewy. One of my faves was a crab soup topped with caviar. I love anything salty and this course, as well as a crawfish stew totally delivered in the sodium department. I wasn't interested in any of the desserts they offered in the tasting menu but they gladly let me choose the strawberry shortcake off the regular one.I thought I was just going to have a few bites since I felt pretty full but low and behold, there was extra room in my distended abdomen for ALL of that strawberry shortcake. It was literally gone in 60 seconds.And when I thought it couldn't get any better, the group of diners next to me saw me taking pictures of all my food and thought I was some kind of food critic...hehe. I just told them that I like food and taking pics of beautiful food and blah, blah, blah. They asked me to pull up a chair and join them and I politely declined. As I was signing for my bill, all of those guys' desserts came out. They kinda notice that I was eyeballing their food so one guy asked if I wanted to take a picture. Then another guy asked if I wanted to try some of what he ordered. Before you know it, I pulled up a chair, grabbed a spoon and was having a dessert tasting. Not only did these nice gentlemen--and lady let me try all their different desserts, they paid for my taxi ride back to the French Quarter. It may sound odd and creepy but these were genuinely nice people that obviously could see my passion for food and were so kind as to let me join in their group. This seems to be the norm out there in NOLA, lots of nice people--locals and tourists alike. Can't wait to get back there.

I chose it over places like Arnaud's and Galatoire's because the location was so convenient to the Garden District (right across the street from Lafayette Cemetery!). First off, the service is absolutely beyond reproach. If all servers had to go to school in order to be a server, the ones who work at Commander's Palace clearly went to the Harvard of serving schools. Expect the kind of deferential, obsequious service normally only found in Michelin-starred restaurant. If you ever wanted to know what it was like to be a celebrity or dignitary, stroll through Commander's Palace. You'll really get the royal treatment (Get it? Eh? Palace...Royal treatment?)The restaurant is very beautiful, though I only toured the downstairs part. We were seated in a gorgeous room filled with sparkling Christmas lights, evergreens, candles and a glass-enclosed center where a few thick tree trunks jutted out from the earth.Unfortunately, neither of us were impressed by the food. It wasn't bad, and I could definitely tell they take great pride in their cooking. But every course was just too rich. The gumbo was like eating a thick tomato paste. My Louisiana shrimp and grits were good at first, but the grits got to be way too buttery after a while and the sauce on the shrimp was so thick....and rich. Plus, the dish was loaded with scallions and I hate scallions. With a passion. My boyfriend's crispy chicken was definitely the best thing on the menu, although the accompanying pickled vegetables were just bizarre. Because of the rich food, we didn't have room for dessert. I did indulge in a $0.25 martini and tried the namesake one made with blue Cura\u00e7ao. It was okay, but tasted of 90% Cura\u00e7ao, 10% unidentifiable miscellaneous.

I mean this place is a monument! \u00a0I sat there wondering - hmmm... where did Mark Twain sit? \u00a0This place has really been around since 1880? \u00a0I felt like I was sitting in a real- live restaurant time capsule just taking in the surroundings. The service was incredible - the waitress actually switched napkins to a darker color to match my dark colored pants that would have contrasted with the white napkins on the table. \u00a0I have never seen that happen! Now the food... and it's so hard to say this! \u00a0The rating is not based on ambiance or history, because for that alone I should add on a star. \u00a0The three stars is simply for the good food, but not really living up to the hype of this being the \"granddaddy of all restaurants.\" We started with the foie gras \u00a0- it was seared foie gras, ok so far looking good... components included strawberries, double good... and the accompaniment in place of the typical brioche - beignets. \u00a0I mean we are in NOLA after all... weeellll, to be completely honest - the beignets overpowered the brilliance of the foie gras. \u00a0I found myself eating the components separately because together, the flavors were just not balanced enough. \u00a0The next dish - the pecan crusted drum - so this was pretty tasty. \u00a0Well flavored, great amount of sauce, but needed just a little more citrus to really bring out the flavor of the fish. \u00a0If it came along side a slice of lemon, probably would have made all the difference in the world. \u00a0The fish was really good, but not the best I had ever had - maybe my expectations were a little too high. \u00a0The french mashed potatoes were well seasoned and tasty. The dessert - strawberry shortcake. So, this may be a bit biased... I LOVE strawberries!! It's one of the elements that you just can't mess up, most any strawberry dessert - and I'm a fan. \u00a0This dessert was no different. \u00a0The biscuit / cake was delicious - perfect crunch and \"cakeyness\" It's not overly sweet or heavy - just right.

My friends had the scallops with pasta. The scallops were tender, although they thought the pasta was bit too salty.

I can't recommend the gumbo enough, it's one of the best things I've ever eaten.

Our whole meal: 2 cocktails, a bottle of wine, an appetizer, gumbo, turtle soup, 2 entrees, 2 desserts for $200. Maybe it's because I live in a city where the cost of living is higher, but it knocked my socks off- \u00a0I was so impressed. \u00a0The only thing that was off-putting about our experience was dessert. We ordered the bread pudding souffle at the recommendation of everyone, and the strawberry shortcake. They really fell short. They were by no means bad, but they were a significant drop from the rest of the meal- I'd give the dessert a 7.5/10 on a scale, and everything else a 12. It also puzzles me because desserts at every other restaurant we went to were outstanding- I would think Commander's Palace not only would be as good, but blow others out of the water. My boyfriend is convinced that the souffle was a bit overdone, it may have been- but I would say even if it was cooked perfectly it wouldn't have been as good as it sounded.

This restaurant lives up to all the hype and its 5-star reputation. Let me first applaud the service at Commander's Palace. Allow me to point out some of the basics: my water glass was always filled and when the ice cubes melted, they took my glass away and gave me another glass of fresh ice water with another plate of fresh lemon slices too...very attentive and detailed service. Also, our dishes were always brought to us and taken away in a synchronized fashion, which showed that the staff is very well trained. Additionally, everyone was very friendly and professional and answered all the questions we had. Now, after studying their menu, we thought the food here is very reasonably priced given the setting. Comparing to the prices NY high-end restaurants charge for dinner, this is actually on the cheap end. We went with the 3-course meal selections and opted for the Gulf Fish (i.e. the red fish) and Shrimp & Grits. For soup & salad, I ordered the tomato salad and my husband went with the gumbo. For dessert, we both had the bread pudding. In addition to the 3-course, we also ordered two appetizers: the Lafourche Surf n' Turf and Shrimp & Tasso Henican. (yup, we can eat!) The Gulf Fish was very similar to the blackened red fish I've had at another restaurant, but the presentation was a lot better with cute little veggie sides. Nothing too special, but still good nevertheless. The Shrimp & Grits on the other hand was the best I've had; granted I've only had shrimp & grits twice in the South, but trust me when I tell ya this dish is delicious and I highly recommend it if you're in for a southern experience. As for the Gumbo, to me, it's not spicy enough, but still decent. The tomato salad was amazing though; very refreshing and the tomatoes were fresh, sweet and juicy. As for the appetizers, we loved their surf & turf! Now it's not the usual steak and lobster that we're used to. Instead, it's fried oysters and pork belly. What an interesting and delicious combo! Their fried oysters were meaty and crispy with thin breading. The root beer braised pork belly was extremely flavor with the crab boil corn pudding as sauce....oh boy, that was just fantastic and definitely a highlight of the meal. Another highlight was our dessert; their bread pudding is a must try. It's not really the usual bread pudding you have in mind. Here I will not mention much details, but definitely do give it a try and you'll be in for a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately, there was a part of our dining experience that I was a little upset about. After the appetizer and soup/salad, we had to wait about 25 minutes for our entrees. We saw entrees been brought up to other tables (who definitely ordered after us) and just waited and then waited more. At 20 minute mark, I called our waitress and asked her to check on our order. 5 minutes later, still no food. I then asked for the manager to come over to our table. The manager politely apologized and within the next minute or so, our food is here. Surprisingly when we got our bill at the end, it was so cheap that we had to stare at it for a couple more seconds; our entrees were taken off the bill. I guess the manager waived it as an apology for the wait. Another demonstration of their outstanding service and how funny that the best meal on our trip just became the cheapest meal, amazing. Oh last but not least, their garlic bread is also hot and delicious. Can't have enough of those but had to stop myself from asking for more to have enough room for the main course. LOL.

The thing I do absolutely love about Commander's is that everyone who works there is very experienced and professional.There were three of us: me, my mom, and my little sister (who now lives with me). My mom and sister were worried about the portion so I asked our server if it would be alright if we only ordered two meals from the coolinary menu and share. She was very cool about it and said that we can order in whatever way we want.We got the gumbo (duck and andouille yesterday) and the Pig and the Peach for our appetizers, Garlic Crusted Wild White Shrimp and Hog Heaven for our main dishes, and bread pudding and Praline Parfait for out desserts. The three of us shared everything and this was perfect in terms of portion.I think the appetizers were my favorite part of the meal. The gumbo and the Pig and the Peach were both great. Once one of the waitstaff realized that we were sharing everything, he brought three cups and split the bowl of gumbo into three cups for us. It was the first time my mother and sister had gumbo and they both liked it! I don't think I would have forgiven them if they didn't. The Pig and the Peach was a fantastic combination of sweet and savory and I love pork belly.Main dishes were enjoyable but the shrimp dish was definitely too heavily seasoned. The best part of the Hog Heaven was the grilled tenderloin. Perfectly seasoned and beautifully pink in the middle.As for the dessert, I did enjoy the bread pudding (it was my first time trying it) but I wasn't in love.

We sat upstairs and faced the trees. It was great. The windows are so huge and clean, it makes you feel like you are actually sitting up in the tree tops. We sat down and were given water and a garlic bread plate which was delicious. Then our server came and explained the menu. He was a nice older French gentleman, although he seemed slightly loony. What I noticed, was that this restaurant is on the ball to please. They have people attending to tables, bringing dishes, walking around picking up trash... I opened a few packs of sugar to put in my tea and as I was stirring someone would come by and pick up the opened sugar packets. This happened each time my tea was refilled. Talk about people paying attention. Another cool thing, is that when the staff brings food to the table, each person waits until everyone is there and ready.

My mom ordered the yellowfin tuna on the servers recommendation. yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026Another beautiful and delicious plate.

I can not stand squash, but this soup was great. The next course was an incredible salad followed by a fillet with mashed potatoes. The fillet was fork tender and cooked perfectly. For dessert we had cheesecake. It was possibly the best piece of cheesecake I have ever had.If I had one complaint it would be that the service seemed a little off. It was great, but not perfect. This could have been because of the size of our group, and it was still a great experience, but it is worth mentioning. If you have never been, you must go to Commanders Palace. If you have been, hurry back.

You don't go to New Orleans and not eat at Commander's. So, without fail, we decided to indulge ourselves in the spectacle and splendor of a wonderful evening, great food and long-standing tradition.Food:Now, I've met a few of the Brennans before Ralph and Jimmy, but not Momma Ella, not the Brennans that run the venerable Commander's Palace, so in all honesty, I had no clue what to expect--other than a fantastic meal. And for the most part, the uptown clan delivered. After taking time to properly plot and plan our way though the menu, we knew our course.We stared with the Soup 1-1-1: gotta love a sampler platter. The gumbo was what I came to New Orleans for, and it was damn good. Dark, spicy and rich in flavor--but it was the turtle soup that made the appetizer worth while. Succulent and hot in way that grew with intensity and addiction with each slurp, we probably would have been fine with just a vat of it for dinner. Alas, we refrained and finished up the Oyster and Absinthe Dome as well. Oysters in a cream-absinth broth surrounded by a puff pastry? Who knew such a delicious creation existed? Well, the Brennan's did, and they did it well.With refreshed drinks and a renewed appetite, our entrees arrived: the special, Mustard Breaded Seared Tuna with sticky rice and avocado, and the a la carte Rack of Lamb with Potatos and Jus Roti. The tuna was cooked perfectly, and when the whole bite of rice and crispy phyllo dough with the avocado hit the tastebuds, it was all instantly recognizable as an almost deconstructed sushi. The whole dish was consumed rather quickly, but what impressed me most was the rice, which wasn't over cooked or too soppy. The lamb was another story. It was ridiculously fatty. It was cooked medium rare, and tasted fantastic, but while lamb should be on the fatty side, when more than half your rack is pure inedible fat, it's something to ponder. And we did, for 20 minutes. As delectable as the potatoes and jus were, as mouthwatering as it smelled, when you spend 20 minutes talking about a dish, not praising, it, unfortunately, that's not 5 stars. Super close though, Commander's. Next time.Venue:There's this big house on a corner in the Garden District, surrounded by lots of other big houses, but this one is different. This one is Robin's Egg Blue, my favorite color. The place is huge. Often rented out for private parties and events, there are more than 8 dining rooms, with decor ranging from traditional Victorian to modern Country Club. \u00a0We were in Column Room, upstairs surrounded by ceiling to floor glass windows. Our service was impeccable, with ever gracious and always helpful. Suggestions and jokes were abundant, and every bit of coordinated presentation was appreciated. What was my most favorite part though, was exiting through the kitchen. Being upstairs means your only trip down and out is through the entire brigade, and what a sight it is. I stayed for a bit, talked to everyone, thanked them, and marveled at the display of culinary expertise on show. Chef Troy was more than accommodating and let me poke around through his poissonner and saucier. So impressive.Ella and her sister still live out back, in the main living quarters. We sneaked back there for a bit and before leaving. Impressive, all around. Suffice it to say, go you won't be disappointed, if only to fine something to talk about.BONUS - Brennan Family TreeFor those that have always wondered, I reveal: the three generations of Brennan restauranteurs..... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Owen P.

The gumbo had an extremely thick and delicious roux speckled with bits of seafood and chicken... Probably one of the best gumbos I've ever had. Unfortunately I didn't like my entree quite as much. The pecan-crusted filet was cooked well, but I wasn't fond of the corn cream sauce it was drowning in. Dessert was pecan pie a-la-mode, tasty, but not amazing. Though the food was enjoyable, the cocky attitude of our server was not. Question: How is the fish cooked? Is it dry or moist?Server response: You must not know where you are. The fish will be cooked perfectly.There was also a situation which really made the server to look like he was blowing a lot of hot air. Q: This dish says it comes with truffles, is that truffle pieces or truffle oil?SR: It comes with black truffle shavings.The dish (seafood cakes) came back with no black truffle shavings in sight.

That same southern, movie-like, jovial politeness continued throughout the meal. We went for brunch on Saturday, after they accommodatingly switched our Friday ressos due to yet another epic lost luggage failure on American Airlines' part, oh but that's a whole 'nother review.

For foodies' sake, I'll mention some of the standouts, which were the turtle soup, pork belly and slow cooked eggs atop jalapeno boudin, pecan crusted fish, the bread pudding, and the rum cake. Of course, flavorful libations are abounding and the people at Commander's do love themselves a boozey lunch, amen for that. While the food is spectacular and certainly something to write home about, what really gets Commander's five stars in my book is the outstanding, unparalleled, fine-dining experience created by their servers and other staff. A waiter will walk you to the ladies room, instead of pointing you in the direction, your water glass is exchanged for an entirely new glass instead of just a refill, your plates hit the table at the exact same time, your empty plate sits on the table only long enough for you to debate whether or not to lick it (No worries, I resisted temptation).

The waitstaff was top notch - helpful without being too formal and extremely well-trained in their profession. \u00a0 There were a couple of tasting menus, but some the items we really wanted to try weren't included, so we went a la carte. (You can actually order a la carte from the tasting menu if there's something that's catches your eye, which is what I did for my entree.)We started with two appetizers: the oyster and absinthe dome & the shrimp and tasso henican. The oysters are poached in absinthe and bacon and a puff pastry sits on top. I am not a huge fan of oysters, but these were definitely good. And, you could really taste the absinthe! I really enjoyed the shrimp dish. It was the only thing that came remotely close to Asian fare I had in New Orleans. The sauce was spicy and sweet all at once. The accompanying okra was a 4/10 on the sliminess scale so not too bad.And since I love soup and could eat it every day, we got the trio, mostly to try the famed turtle soup. Unfortunately, it was my least favorite preparation. Somehow turtle soup sort of tastes like beef barley? It was okay, but I wouldn't order it again. Especially since the other two soups--gumbo and a seafood bisque--were phenomenal. Onto our main course: I had the Crawfish Maque Choux, another soup-esque dish. Peppers, corn, okra, crawfish and bacon married in a rich bisque served with white rice. It was tasty, but I wasn't blown away. But, I got to suck my first crawfish head - yay! My husband's fish was phenomenal - he opted for the pecan crusted gulf fish topped with crab, poached in champagne, and set in a creamy corn sauce. If I was at home, I would have licked that sauce off the plate. \u00a0We were stuffed, but our waiter told us a visit to Commander's Palace wouldn't be complete without ordering the famous bread pudding. This is certainly not my favorite type of dessert, but we gave it a shot. It was actually pretty darn good. It was souffle style and served with a whiskey cream sauce. And again, you could really taste the booze. I waffled back and forth between a 4 and a 5 for my rating. It was excellent, but pitting it against comparable restaurants in other cities I've been to, it leans more toward a 4. If my entree had been as spectacular as the waiter promised, it'd be a 5. But, as New Orleans' most famous restaurant--and many think best--you shouldn't miss it. And yes, men are requested to wear a jacket, so wear one (yes, I'm talking to you blue polo shirt)!

I am polite, well groomed, and never send anything back. \u00a0 \u00a0I tip 25-30% and I drink....a lot. My sister in-law arrived early for our brunch reservation, we both were dressed to the nines (thank you 'Trashy Diva') and ready to put down some hard earned plastic for an elegant meal in an iconic setting. \u00a0We were greeted by Ti Brennan (a nice start) who complimented our outfits and led us to our table. \u00a0Our waiter came over a few moments later and we put in drink orders. \u00a0He was pleasant, but not overly friendly. \u00a0His assistants buzzed around.After the drinks were ordered, another companion joined us. \u00a0The menus were studied and I wasn't that crazy about the vegetarian option, but willing to take it since I'm easy-going. \u00a0 My friend mentioned as she was ordering (since she is motherly and sort of take-charge) that I wasn't thrilled about the pancakes, would they possibly have another option for her herbivore friend? \u00a0The waiter confirmed that they offered a vegetable tart which I eagerly ordered.More drinks...all very good, no complaints there. \u00a0The appetizers were well done, although my friends request for some spoonbread went un-filled. \u00a0Then the entrees. \u00a0Everyone was happy with theirs, but mine turned out to be what looked like a 'Hot Pocket' filled to the brim with tasteless mushrooms. \u00a0The crust was hard (like a HOT POCKET), and the shrooms tasted sort of like dirty tofu. Yecccch. \u00a0I resigned myself. \u00a0Half of the meal (appetizer and drinks) had been good, I would just save room for dessert! \u00a0Our waiter noticed that I was ignoring my entree when he came around to see how we were doing.\"Do you not like it?\" He asked\"No, I'm not really a fan.\" I replied nicely.\"I can take it back?\" He offered, an edge to his tone.\"No, that's fine.\" I tried to sound casual, took another swig of my cocktail \u00a0and kept smiling.\"If you're not going to eat it...\" He leaned in and took my plate anyways.Oh yes. \u00a0He did.And then I saw this man saunter over to the maitre'd or manager (an older man overseeing the dining room). \u00a0I'm pretty adept at reading lips and if it weren't for the jazz band playing, I'd probably have heard their interaction. \u00a0I kept looking as the older man asked what was wrong and our waiter responded \"She doesn't like it,\" shrugged his shoulders and ROLLED HIS EYES.Game on, b*tch.I've never felt so embarassed and at the same time...angry! \u00a0I seethed and stared, making sure that when the waiter looked back at my table, to reference where the plate came from, he knew I saw the interaction and was not a happy camper about it. \u00a0His attempt to make amends by offering another salad were met with a polite but crisp \"No thank you,\" from me. \u00a0My dining companions were floored (but honestly, they both really enjoyed their food).I would've kept the Hot Pocket, paid for the meal AND had dessert, chalked it up to a bad day and given it another try someday down the road. \u00a0The bread pudding souflee which followed could've been made with angel tears and served with a side of diamonds and I still would've been perturbed. \u00a0It wasn't the fault of the kitchen (although the Hot Pocket was abhorrent), but the service that made me dislike my experience with this venerable institution.", "Date": "2011-02-06", "Author_Location": "Litchfield County, CT"}, {"Author": "Kim-Thao H.", "ReviewID": "0O4qgFDFpzOk_Smb5Yp85A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now I know why Commander's Palace is considered top-tier restaurant in New Orleans. \u00a0I had the pleasure of dining here last night with my boyfriend for my birthday. \u00a0It was truly an experience; from the food to the service, everything was nothing short of impeccable and outstanding. \u00a0I honestly don't know where to begin with this review; it was just THAT good!I decided to get the three course trio since everything I wanted was on there, so why not right? \u00a0It included a soup or salad with a choice of three different entrees and the bread pudding souffle or strawberry shortcake. \u00a0Of course I ordered the much talked about Turtle Soup. \u00a0It was delicious and lived up to the hype. \u00a0The touch of sherry sauce made the soup all the better. \u00a0I'm a lover of Shrimp and Grits, so it goes without saying that I got the Barbecue Shrimp that lays over a bed of grits. \u00a0The flavors emanating from this dish was incredible! \u00a0I could not find one thing wrong with the dish! \u00a0It was so mouthwateringly good!! \u00a0My boyfriend got the pork entree; I really wish I could remember what it was called, but it was HUGE! \u00a0I had a bite of the dish, and it too was amazing! \u00a0The pork was oh so tender and the mixture of different flavors was mindblowing! \u00a0And now to my favorite part of every meal: DESSERT! \u00a0And boy oh boy, Commander's definitely didn't disappoint in this category. \u00a0You already know I ordered the famous Bread Pudding Souffle! \u00a0I really thought I died and went to heaven upon that first bite. \u00a0The top of the souffle was so light and fluffy, which created the perfect balance to the bread pudding on the bottom. \u00a0Wow oh wow, one of the best desserts I've ever had, if not THE best! \u00a0I'm really regretting I didn't finish it at this moment, but I was so full I thought my skirt was going to rip last night!And for the service, just like everyone else has said, is the best I've ever experienced! \u00a0The wait staff literally knows everything about the menu and how every item is cooked. \u00a0I must say I was thoroughly impressed. \u00a0Our waters and wine glasses were continually re-filled throughout the meal, and having that accomplished is very refreshing. \u00a0Although, the constant re-filling of the wine brought me to a giddy state, if you know what I mean.

Commander's Palace is one of NOLA's dining institutions and it's an experience you won't soon forget. If you happen to be in NOLA on a Sunday, make your reservations for brunch. The price of your entree includes an appetizer and dessert and if you choose Chef Tory's Jazz Brunch, a bloody mary is included. The Commander's bloody mary is a bit on the spicy side (which you can make spicier with the rim of cajun spice) and is finished tableside by your waiter with his extra pour of vodka that is frozen into an ice block to keep it chilled. I did order the Jazz Brunch but I substituted the Shrimp and Tasso Henican. The appetizer is just the right portion - 4 shrimp stuffed with tasso with a spicy sauce that is cooled down by the pepper jelly that surrounds your plate. The \"jelly\" is more like a thick sauce and it compliments the spiciness from the shrimp sauce. The okra that is on the plate is cooked perfectly - it is not gummy (which only happens if you overcook it.) For my main course, I had the Eggs Couchon De Lait. The description from the menu:\"Smoky braised pork debris over black pepper and rosemary biscuits with soft poached eggs, winter mushrooms & bourbon-bacon fat hollandaise.\"A lot going on here but it was a wonder to eat. If you think it sounds like an upscale eggs benedict, you would be right. But the differences in the ingredients made the dish really special. The pork was tender and had a smoky flavor - there was a bit of the braising liquid in the dish that soaked into the rosemary biscuit, which was sweet and buttery and had an amazing texture even after soaking in the braising liquid. Add the perfectly poached eggs into the mix along with the hollandaise and you have a very rich, multi-layered entree. The sauces mixed together into what I called a \"sauce of love\" which I used french bread to savor more of it. Dessert was equally impressive - the Creole Bread Pudding Souffle is a great twist on bread pudding - the top of it is a souffle which is pierced by your server when it arrives in order to spoon in the whiskey cream sauce. The souffle mixed into the pudding lightens up the dessert. I won't speak for my friend who was with me, but she ordered the Duck Confit and Strawberry Salad, some sort of crab dish and the Bourbon Pecan Pie. She was very happy with her meal and I did try the pie, which was amazing - you can tell that real cane syrup is used for the pie, it really gives such an amazing depth of flavor.Of course, service was impeccable and we even had the host come over and speak with us during our meal.

We were staying in the quarter and hopped on the trolley over to the Garden District. 25 cents for the trolley...nice way to see the city and admire the beautifu houses in the G.D. After getting off at our stop...it was just a short walk to the restaurant which is across from Lafayette Cemetary - which I believe is one of the oldest cemetaries in NOLA and part of Interview with the Vampire was filmed there (it's a very interesting cemetary & walking tours are available). Ok, enough about all this....on to the food!As I said we did Sunday brunch which is a three meal for about 60 bucks. Now, you might think 60 bucks is a bit much for brunch but this is actually a pretty great deal for C.P. as dinner could easily cost you 100 bucks per person. It's a jazz brunch too...that's right...a live jazz band tours the restaurant and plays throughout the brunch time. It's great fun. Also, there is a lovely outdoor patio for you to sit and enjoy a drink while waiting (not sure if you can dine there during brunch as I didn't see anyone eating outside). To start I had the classic eggs sardou which was delicious. My friend started with the white shrimp remaloude. We both enjoyed our starters...and the nice hot bread they serve you with your brunch. Next up was bbq shrimp for me (so so good) and the pecan roated gulf fish for my friend (which she enjoyed). Finally we ended with the bread pudding (I enjoyed it, my friend liked it but felt she was just not a fan of bread pudding)...I cannot remember what my friend got...I want to say it was some sort of custard or creme brulee...I know she enjoyed it and that's what counts. We each got a mimosa - this is not included with brunch but like I said this was our splurge meal so we went for it. It was money well spent in both our opinions...we were STUFFED for the rest of the day! We walked it off exploring the Garden District and Magazine Street...If you are looking for a special treat and a NOLA tradition (the place has been around since the late 1800's for crying out loud)....go to C.P. You can easily make a day or afternoon of brunch and a walking tour of the G.D. and/or the Lafayette Cemetary.

This was also my first introduction to sweet breads and mint juleps...I'll tell you I'm not a huge fan of either.

It was good, but not great. I've had a number of more delicious meals at other restaurants throughout the city of New Orleans. The meal was by no means a let-down, but I wasn't wowed.Let's go back to the beginning. The service was 5-star from the moment we walked through the door. We were greeted by every single staff member who crossed our path and we were escorted to our table immediately upon arrival. The restaurant is beautiful on the inside and also incredibly spacious; something I wouldn't have thought from the outside. There are a number of different dining rooms and we were seated upstairs. It was like dining in a treehouse--we had a pretty, near panoramic view of the surrounding treetops. Our server was friendly and helpful. He offered honest options about menu offerings and was just the right amount of attentive. The delivery and presentation of food and drinks is precise and professional. For example, if there are five people dining at your table, then five servers will arrive to deliver your meals and place them on your table at the exact same moment.So, about the food. The boy and I opted to dine off of the COOLinary New Orleans menu--three courses (soup or salad, entr\u00e9e, and dessert) for $35. Between us we had: -Soups 1-1-1 (a demi serving of three soups: gumbo, turtle soup, and soup du jour). This offering is always on the menu and I highly recommend opting for this as a starter. It is a food opportunity to sample a number of offerings. The gumbo was tasty, as was the soup du jour, which was eggplant shrimp bisque. \u00a0Neither of us was too fond of the turtle soup, which was overwhelmed by the taste of the sherry.-The Commander's Salad (hearts of romaine, parmesan, pressed egg, housemade bacon, french bread croutons, grated gruyere, and creamy black pepper dressing). The boy says, \"the salad was great; one of the best I've ever had\". I agree.-Cajun Mixed Grill (sugarcane smoked tenderloin, boudin noir, sausage, and spicy andouille with crawfish boiled potatoes, compressed nectarines, and smoky trotter jus). The boy says, \"The pork was great; it was flavorful and juicy. The boudin I didn't care for. I think that boudin is boudin and I've actually had better. The summer sausage was a little charred for my liking.\"-Fire-Grilled Louisiana White Shrimp (Gulf shrimp served over Ponchatoula red beans, ripped greens, andouille, sweet corn, toasted garlic, crushed creole tomatoes, and creamy shrimp etouffee). I don't have much to say about this. It was a good meal made with fresh, local ingredients, but there wasn't anything about the flavor that wowed me.-Creole Cream Cheese Cheesecake. Apparently this housemade dessert takes five days to prepare. It was creamy and delicious, but I've had better.-Bread Pudding.

Yesterday I went to Commander's for brunch with my girlfriend and her family. I didn't really know what to expect, except that everyone says that its really good. I had a slight suspicion that it might be a lot of food, so I went in with a big appetite. And I'm glad I did. It was so much food, and it all was so delicious that it was hard to stop eating. The brunch is a three course meal; appetizer, entr\u00e9e, and dessert. I'm going to give you a run down of not just what I ordered, but everything that I tasted. For the appetizers we had the turtle soup, the corn and crab bisque, the Commanders salad, and the smoked crab cake. I ordered the turtle soup, because I had never had turtle before and just needed to try it. I'm adventurous like that. It was much better than I thought it was going to be. They topped it with some Sherry, which made it really rich. I think my favorite appetizer was the corn and crab bisque! I'm a big fan of soups and that was one of the best I have had. So creamy and flavorful. The smoked crab cake was good too. I epically liked the poached friend egg that it was topped with. \u00a0As for entr\u00e9es I tasted the Bananas Fosters Pancakes and the Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish. The table decided that the pancakes were the best thing ordered! They were addicting. I'm not even sure how I managed to finish them, because of how sweet they were. Topped with bananas, pecans and a cream cheese sauce and served with a side dish of home-made whipped cream. WOW! Might have been the best pancakes I have ever had! The Pecan Crusted Fish was also really great. It was cooked perfectly and the crust on the outside had just the right amount of crispness. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The desserts were all out of this world. We had the Creole Bread Pudding Souffle, the Creole Cream Cheese Cheesecake, and the Praline Parfait. I don't know which one was my favorite. Maybe the parfait. But, It would never want to make such a difficult decision. I do have to tell you that it takes three days to make the cheesecake and its the recipe the Emeril Lagasse created when he was working at Commanders.

"Y6yH06aj0F_5QKrQAT_VmQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A weekend trip to New Orleans was perfectly timed to write my 100th Yelp review on a restaurant I had heard about since I was a kid and probably the first nationally-recognized restaurant name I knew: Commander's Palace.Walking in, I was surprised how big the restaurant is--a large dining room to the right, a second floor above it, through the kitchen (which smelled amazing), past a small courtyard and into what looked like an expansion dining room where our table was.The wine list (though \"wine book\" would be more accurate) is both impressive and intimidating. \u00a0Apparently a new version of the list had recently come out, so working my way through the binder was like paging through a freshly-printed manuscript. \u00a0Hell, I even liked the font. \u00a0I decided on the flagship of a personal favorite winery: a 2007 \"Les Pavots\" Cabernet Sauvignon blend from Peter Michael Winery. \u00a0(Aside: The wine did not disappoint!) \u00a0The wine was poured into a decanter over a candle to watch for and catch any sediment.We went with the Chef's Playground tasting menu with two substitutions in order to add in two Commander's Palace classics: the turtle soup and the bread pudding souffl\u00e9 . \u00a0The first course was the Turtle Soup spiked with sherry. \u00a0I had no frame of reference with this, having never had turtle soup before. \u00a0With the amount of vegetables and spices in it, the soup almost seemed like chili, but not nearly as thick nor overpowering. \u00a0Sadly, there really wasn't enough meat in the soup for me to hone in on the taste of the turtle. \u00a0Overall, I would say the soup was very good, but short of amazing.The second course, on the other hand, was amazing: Hand-Pulled Creole Mozzarella served with three pieces of toasted bread covered, respectively, with fennel, tomato, and bacon jam. \u00a0The mozzarella is hand-pulled in a crab boil for taste and topped with some seasonings. \u00a0All three of the jams tasted great, and the combination with the mozzarella (while a little unwieldy given the softness of the cheese) is fantastic. \u00a0This was the best dish of the night, and one of the best dishes I have had in recent memory. \u00a0A slight criticism: \u00a0The truffle oil fragrance, while generally pleasant, was a little strong and actually distracting from how great the dish tasted.The third course brought a little refreshment before the main courses--\"Saint 75,\" a mix of St. Germain, Tanqueray Gin, and Basil in a shot-sized glass topped with champagne. \u00a0The basil came off very well, and I liked the idea of a light drink to cleanse the palette before the heavier items.The fourth course was Crispy Soft Shell Crab served on top of a bed of spicy pecans, buttered black rice, roasted chilies, sweet corn, and Spanish saffron. \u00a0Again, the crab and its sauces had a little bit of spice to them, but nothing too overpowering. \u00a0The rice accompaniment was also very good. \u00a0This was probably the second best dish of the night.The fifth course was Ox Tail Raviolis--ravioli stuffed with black truffle, goat cheese, and ox tail and tossed with sage, brown butter, lemon, and Parmesan cheese. \u00a0While the ravioli filling, including the ox tail, was very good, I thought it was covered with a little too much Parmesan cheese and the other items.The sixth course was Commander Palace's signature Creole Bread Pudding Souffl\u00e9 topped with a whiskey cream sauce. \u00a0Now, I like bread pudding, and I like souffl\u00e9, but I remain unconvinced on the bread pudding and souffl\u00e9 combination. \u00a0This is not to say the dish was not delicious--because it was--but I almost feel like the restaurant could have done more by going distinctly in one of the two directions rather than the combination.Service was top-notch--formal but friendly. \u00a0Some nice touches: \u00a0(1) Someone holding an umbrella to cover you the three feet from the cab to the restaurant awning. \u00a0(2) Accommodating the substitutions to the tasting menu. \u00a0(3) When we asked for a moist towelette after the mozzarella, our server returned with warmed, moist napkins formed into a fleur-de-lis. \u00a0(4) \u00a0I asked the server to save the wine label for me, and he came back with the label affixed to the back of a menu--it can practically be framed.I was very pleased with my visit to Commander's Palace, and the restaurant lived up to its stellar reputation. \u00a0I debated with myself on whether Commander's Palace deserved a high-four star review (though Yelp would only forever see it as four stars like any other) and five stars. \u00a0In the end, I'm settling on five stars: \u00a0The experience wasn't perfect and possibly the taste of some of the items could be worked over just a little bit more, but there is no mistake that the restaurant delivers in its mission--taking high quality ingredients and serving food (and creating a dining environment) reflective of the heart and soul of New Orleans.", "Date": "2011-07-26", "Author_Location": "Cleveland, OH"}, {"Author": "Eugene F.", "ReviewID":

Before our visit to New Orleans, we made reservations for 12:30 on a Saturday which worked out to be a Jazz Brunch which was a sort of prix fix meal with a beverage, a soup or salad, an entree, and dessert. \u00a0A jazz band wandered through the restaurant as we ate and played some nice jazz music that wasn't too loud, and created a nice ambiance. This is not your run-of-the-mill restaurant. \u00a0You have to dress-up in nicer clothes--no shorts are allowed. \u00a0I wore stuff that I would wear to work, but did notice that there were some younger folks that were wearing golf/polo shirts.

Maybe it was too early in the AM and I didn't see any eggs and pancakes and stuff like that. The meal was a 3-courser with a starter, entree and dessert.For the first course I had the trio of soups; turtle soup, gumbo with Andouille sausage and shrimp, and crab corn chowder. I didn't like the turtle soup and not necessarily the meat but the flavor of the broth. The gumbo was excellent. Smokey with a navy bean type of deep flavor. The crab corn chowder was sweet, creamy and intense. I could eat a whole bowl of this but would probably go into cardiac arrest.The second course was an 18-hour braised short rib with potatoes and a poached egg. Words will be hard to describe it but let me just say it was excellent. A great beef rib flavor, slightly smokey, tender, moist and delicious. I made the right choice, though I am sure everything on the menu is excellent.Finally, I had the bread pudding souffle with whiskey cream sauce.

I will say that the server's description nearly made me re-choose, but I am so glad I stuck with it. It is in fact a bottom feeder (which sounds a little off-putting, but since it eats other delectable seafood like oysters, what's not to love) and a red fish (meant nothing to me), but it is oh so good. The grits which were self-proclaimed the best were actually the best. They had goat cheese in them which I adore.I will say that I was not blown away by their bread pudding which I had been sampling elsewhere.

Despite two very different circumstances (one, a work dinner following a long day of working a conference, and the second, a romantic dinner for two), I was thoroughly impressed with everything on both occasions.At both dinners, I ordered the three-course special. For the work dinner we shared the Angry Oysters and Shrimp and Tasso Henican appetizers. They were spicy and flavorful and I couldn't get enough. Both dishes left incredible sauces which doubled as sensational spreads for the bread. For my first course I selected the Soup 1-1-1, which included the soup du jour, the gumbo of the day, and turtle soup. All were lovely, but the turtle soup was absolutely incredible. My entree was the Cajun mixed grill, which included pork tenderloin and three types of sausages. My favorite part was the sausage of the day, which was blueberry. It tasted like sausage wrapped in blueberry pancakes and it was absolutely dynamite. Thankfully I knew to quit early so that I had room for the (surprise!) outstanding Alabama peach cobbler.At my second dinner, I more informed, and may have ordered even better. We split the Angry Oysters again, and also repeated the Alabama peach cobbler. For my soup I went with the turtle only. My husband got the 1-1-1 and I think the gumbo and soup of the day were actually even better than the day I ordered it. We both got the gulf fish entree, which also trumped the fantastic Cajun mixed grill from earlier in the week.The cocktails at Commander's are no slouches either. Many places I've been to have touted their \"handcrafted libations crafted by master mixologists.\" Commander's does not do this (that I know of), but it if does, they live up to the hype. These drinks were just as phenomenal as the food. My favorite was the refreshing Watermelon Caipirinha.Last, but not least, I especially liked the service. The wait staff at Commander's was in a different strata than any other restaurant I've been to, even by New Orleans standards. All the orders and food were delivered in symphony. Drink glasses never fully emptied and dish clutter was always removed promptly.I cannot think of a single ding on this restaurant and I had two lengthy dinners to find one.

So in seeing escargot on the menu I found this a fine opportunity for the Brennan family to wow me with their mastery of cookery. Ultimately it was not for me. I have no doubt that it was technically wonderful and amazingly put together, but to me it looked...gross. The snails, LOOKED like snail...head and all.

You'll never feel more antebellum, I assure you that.We ordered two salads as an appetizer because we realized we hadn't seen a single vegetable the entire trip, so it was time. \u00a0We ordered their version of a kicked up caesar and man, it was delicious. \u00a0Gruyere, creamy peppery dressing, garlic, romaine, a little heat, made this salad well worthwhile. \u00a0The seasonal tomato salad, however, was even better. \u00a0It had a serious kick, and the tomatoes were just perfection on a hot night. \u00a0If you see this on the menu, order it. \u00a0You must.We decided to split the grilled shrimp and the filet. \u00a0The shrimp was delicious, absolutely perfect and the compliments of grilled peppers/vegetables were to die for. \u00a0The filet is one of the best filets in the world. \u00a0My mother, who never eats any type of steak other than a filet mignon, has always claimed that the Commander's Palace filet is the best in the world. \u00a0I can see why she thinks that. \u00a0It's incredible. \u00a0It's how a steak should be. \u00a0It's what every little steak hopes to be when it grows up. \u00a0 \u00a0The mashed potatoes under that filet, though, are just as, if not more so delicious. \u00a0Creamy, cheesy, smooth, intense, everything you want out of mashed potatoes.And now...the strawberry shortcake. \u00a0They bake the home-made biscuits to order, and top these freshly out of the oven biscuits with strawberries and cream. \u00a0What is better than that? \u00a0Simple, delicious, and it reminded me of childhood. Another perk of Commander's Palace? \u00a0 The Summer Dry \u00a0Rose Wine List. \u00a0We ordered the first one off the list and were completely in love, all over again.And of course, the service is impeccable.So, no, we didn't have the mushu pork my boyfriend expected, but hell, we were a-ok with that.", "Date": "2009-05-29", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Mary S.", "ReviewID": "55ZquqhzVSa_Tynp66qICw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Props to Chef Tory! \u00a0 \u00a0This should be a destination stop in New Orleans, it's quite the foodies dream.

I was pretty excited, and when I got there I immediately felt like the anticipation was warranted. The staff was warm and friendly, and they led my girlfriend and I through the kitchen (felt like the scene in goodfellas) to our table, and every single staff member we came in contact with made eye contact with us and said \"welcome in.\" Charming.As was advised by everyone beforehand, I wore a full suit and tie, though there were many in the restaurant who were wearing less formal clothes. Honestly, unless you break out in a rash with formal wear on, I would recommend doing it up. I am certainly the furthest thing from a Southern Gentleman, but I did my best impersonation of one. For some reason it just felt right in this place, and I think that the staff does notice. Not sure if that's why we got amazing service, but we most certainly did. All the little details that I don't even think about were attended to by our waitstaff, they were friendly and helpful without being pushy or smothering. The decor of the interior is fantastic, the courtyard section is also beautiful, and the history of the place as told by our waiter was interesting and all added to the mystique that is Commander's Palace.Food was fantastic. I was disappointed that my girlfriend didn't want to get the tasting menu (the entire table needs to be in agreement if you are doing the tasting menu), but since the turtle soup and bread pudding souffle were not on the tasting menu and I really wanted to try these, I wasn't that upset about it. I think I made the right choice.Started off with appetizer of crawfish gnocci, an excellent start - loved the flavor of the crawfish with the spices and cheese of the gnocci, just the right amount of heat (I like it hotter, but probably not necessary)We both then went on to the turtle soup, which was brought to us at the exact moment we finished our appetizers. Accompanied by delicious fresh baked french bread, this was one of the highlights of the meal, I recommend everyone try this dish. \u00a0Totally unique flavor, hearty but not too rich. There is an added swirl of sherry which the servers pour right at the table, it gave the dish an added complexity that I really enjoyed.My entree was the softshell crab. \u00a0The crab itself was perfectly fried - crispy but not oily or heavy. The accompanying accoutrement were also a good compliment, not overshadowing the crab flavor. I forgot what was in the sauce, but it was really delicious. I sopped it all up with bread after I devoured the entire thing way faster than I should have. As I sat there watching my girlfriend eat the rest of her entree, I cursed myself for not taking my time.My special ladyfriend's entree was the duck (med rare) with foie gras stuffing and fried sweet potato strips. \u00a0I only had a taste of this, but what a taste it was. The duck was super rich, and when you add the foie gras stuffing, oof. Avoid this if you can't handle decadence. As they say in New Orleans, \"if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing.\"And finally dessert, the bread pudding souffle with a whiskey cream sauce. \u00a0The souffle comes to the table fresh from the kitchen, then the waiter punctures a hole in the middle with a spoon and then sprinkles the whiskey cream sauce inside it / over it, asking you to tell them when its enough. I wish I had asked if they could have left the sauce at the table. This was an amazing dessert, the whiskey cream sauce isn't too thick and not overly sweet, but it is very boozy, so maybe not the best if you don't like alcohol. Luckily I do, and love whiskey, so really appreciated it. The texture was also very interesting, the top is like a fluffy turnover/popover while the bottom of the dish was more like bread pudding.The cocktails were also great. I went with the Sazerac (the official cocktail of New Orleans), which was delicious. My girlfriend got some sort of purple drank martini which I made the mistake of forgetting to try, and a glass of wine which she said was delicious and surprising since most wines that are by the glass only tend to be garbage. Our total bill came out to be 147$ before tip, which I think was really not that bad since we had an appetizer and drinks and were stuffed.The other places we went in NOLA were also delicious - po boys at Johnny's and Napoleon house, crawfish boil, beignets and cafe au lait at cafe dumonde, and late night burgers and chocolate cherry freeze at camelia grille, Everything we ate at Cochon Butcher.

We sat upstairs in the Garden Room - make sure you ask for that when you make your reservation, it's the upstairs dining area with large windows and plants outside, and it's gorgeous. That Saturday they were having their jazz brunch as usual, so we were serenaded by some lovely musicians who also came to our table and played \"John Brown's Body\" at my dad's request :) For my appetizer, I had the Ponchatoula blueberry spinach salad with goat cheese and spiced pecans. It was phenomenal - so fresh, so juicy, the blueberries were so refreshing, the pecans the perfect highlight, etc., so on and so forth. I love salads, and this was a stellar salad.Then my entree came. I got the pecan crusted gulf fish, which that day was a black drum fish. The fish comes with spiced pecans and crushed corn sauce. THIS WAS THE BEST FISH I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Even better than the redfish I had at MiLa's prix fixe lunch a few weeks ago - which you can refer to my rave review about. It was decadent but not unbearably rich. The pecan flavor was perfect. The corn was succulent. The fish was tender, juicy, and moist. I couldn't believe how delicious this fish was.Just when I thought I couldn't be any more impressed, my dessert came. The creole bread pudding SOUFFLE - read: it's PUFFY - with hot whiskey sauce added tableside. They bring you this delectable-looking puffy bread pudding, and then they come up with a saucer of hot creamy whiskey sauce, poke a hole in your pudding, and pour it in. It's sinful in the best way - you just don't understand until you've had it. With dessert I had their delicious chicory coffee.. can't go wrong with coffee and chicory :) The drinks I had were just OK - there was a peach one, which was great but that I was allergic to. I also had a strawberry one which was not that good, too sweet and too small for the price - don't get that one. My mom thought she'd had a better Sazerac elsewhere. I finished the meal with a glass of white, which was good. Just be careful with the cocktails, they weren't real winners.Overall though, this honestly might be the best meal I've had in New Orleans.

There were only two other tables seated on the second floor so we weren't happy about being 'put in the corner', away from the live music. Eventually the place started filling up and we found out the musicians travel room to room. Despite the overabundance of staff, it took our waitstaff (we're not really sure who our server was) 30 minutes to give us menus. Perhaps this is the Southern, relaxed way of eating that us Yankees are not used to. The garlic bread was excellent. We asked for another round, especially since it took a while for the food to come and we weren't that interested in cocktails. When any of the courses are served, everyone is served at the same time (and maybe that's why it was hard getting our servers' attention.)Note: All entree prices include appetizer and dessert. I started with the soup du jour which seemed to be seafood roux based. Not bad. My main was the Eggs Couchon De Lait which were delicious and perfectly cooked. The portion size is huge! The poached eggs and pork shoulder sat perfectly on biscuits with a generous drenching of Tabasco hollandaise. My friend got the Whiskey Smoked Chicken and Eggs which were similar except with a stronger kick. The third got the shrimp and grits with BBQ sauce (he doesn't like BBQ and did not like the grits - poor guy).The desserts we tried were amazing! Make sure you save stomach space! We diversified and shared among the three of us. Some desserts take longer to prepare so they said something about preorder, which we did when we placed our order, but it still took a while. We tried the Creole Bread Pudding Souffle (add $3) with hard sauce. SO good. I wish I could eat some right now. The chocolate molten cake was standard - would not recommend.

Originally, we wanted to try the jazz brunch on Sunday, but we made our reservation too late and they also stated they could not seat a party of 5 for the brunch. Instead, we chose to go on Monday for lunch, which turned out to be a GREAT deal with the prie fixe and 25 cent martinis! We were told to dress quite formally -- no shorts, preferably no jeans and jackets preferred for men. Unfortunately, we did not pack non-jeans (at least the guys did not), but we did our best with what we had and did not feel like we were too out of place (well maybe a bit initially).The restaurant is much larger than it appears from the outside and also much nicer! We were brought upstairs to a room in the back, which was very brightly lit from natural sunlight. While perusing the menu, we each ordered a 25 cent martini! Those were delicious. They brought us freshly toasted garlic bread as well as a loaf of french bread while we waited for our food.Our server, Jenny, was the sweetest lady ever. She introduced the menu to us and the several options, including the two prie fixe options. One is the \"healthy\" 3 course for $29 and the Creole Luncheon was $32 for a 3 course. She also told us that for the soup & dessert, we could substitute other soup/desserts. \u00a0Two of us ordered the Creole Luncheon, both substituting the soup with the soup sampler, which came with a small cup of EACH of the soups (turtle soup, gumbo, and the soup du juor, which was crab bisque that day). \u00a0Jenny suggested that we have the bread pudding souffle as one dessert and the strawberry shortcake as the other so all 4 of us could share. That was a wonderful suggestion and we gladly accepted. I ordered a bowl of the soup du jour and The Commander's Salad as my \"entree.\" \u00a0When the soups were brought out, mine did not come along and I assumed I would just get my soup and salad together. \u00a0I tried the two other soups, which were both wonderful. \u00a0Alas, when the entrees came out, only the salad came. \u00a0So, I asked Jenny and she immediately apologized and told me the soup would be on the house. I was really impressed by her readiness to ameliorate the situation; I was not even upset to begin with but Jenny was quick to diffuse any potential conflict. I really enjoyed the crab bisque, which had good chunks of crab in it and it was not too heavy or creamy, so I could enjoy more of it. The salad was pretty basic -- romaine lettuce, Parmesan, pressed eggs, house made bacon, French bread croutons, grated Gruy\u00e8re and creamy black pepper dressing... but somehow SO tasty. I enjoyed each bite. And wow, the dessert? SO good. The strawberry shortcake was JUST as good as their famous bread pudding souffle. The shortcake itself was baked to perfection and the strawberries were very fresh. Of course, the bread pudding souffle was wonderful -- not your typical souffle, but more bread pudding than anything else. But also a wonderful dessert and it lived up well to its fame.Aside from excellent food, I think I most enjoyed my experience at Commander's due to the ambiance and also our interactions with Jenny. She was an extremely attentive server and toward the end of our meal, she recommended some places to visit near the restaurant and even wrote it all down for us. She then chatted with us for about 10 minutes telling us stories about celebrities she had served before, the parades, etc. We really enjoyed chatting with her and felt that not only was she professional, she was friendly and personable.

I have to give a big \"shout out\" to Ginger D. for suggesting we go on our latest trip to the Big Easy.Commander's Palace is a dining experience of yester-year, an art that is being lost. This type of dining takes you back to a time when a restaurant meal was an outing, conversing with your family was a pleasure and one could enjoy a cocktail without the hustle and bustle of work or the pressure to check your cell phone every five minutes. Our 3 hour bunch consisted of the best service, live music, pleasant conversation and wonderful food. My only complaint is that there is only ONE vegetarian entree on the brunch menu (a type of pancake dish- which changes seasonally, I had the banana's foster), which is odd given that breakfast/brunch is usually the most vegetarian friendly meal. I must sadly report that the coffee cups are uber small (again, old fashioned dining means smaller portions) and the coffee was so delightful they could not keep my cup full!I love Commander's Palace.

Our water glasses were always full (as were our cocktail cups), and the famous garlic bread was there to great as right as our tummy's started to growl.The meals was impeccable. My dining companion went with the prix fixe which at $39 (a steal) included a bloody mary, appt, main course, and desert.My starter: Shrimp stuffed with tasso in a crystal hot sauce glaze with a pepper jelly reduction. Before ordering this, our waiter said \"these are the best thing on the menu and the best shrimp you'll ever eat\". Hyperbole aside, these were best part of the meal (really saying something at commander's where all the food is so good) and probably one of the top 3 shrimp preparations I've had...ever! The buttery hot sauce glaze was a perfect foil to the smokiness of the tasso and the sweetness of the shrimp and the red pepper sauce.My guest had the gumbo of the day (sausage and chicken I believe). It was very, very good.My main course was a super slow cooked veal over a crispy polenta cake with scrambled eggs and a crawfish sauce. This was very, very good. The veal melted in my mouth and the crispy polental cake was perfectly crispy and creamy at the same time.My guest's main course was unbelievably good: cochon du lait eggs benedict with the most AMAZING pork gravy I've ever had. Very, very rich though...even between the two of us, we couldn't finish, and we have VERY big appetites. But, oh, oh, so good.For desert I had a peach shortcake which was delicious. My partner had the bread pudding souffle, which is as good as I remember it--in other words, fantastic.This is a \"jazz\" brunch, so it would be criminal to not speak about the music. The band was really really fun. Trios and quartets of top notch musicians would walk through the various dining rooms playing their fixed sets and whatever the audience would request (don't ask for \"saints\" though...it's almost insulting to ask really good musicians to play this tourist \u00a0\"I know nothing about jazz\" song).So, bottom line...come to the jazz brunch, enjoy the 3 hour adventure, and then walk it all off in the lafayette cemetery or around the garden district's beautiful houses.", "Date": "2010-06-24", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Sarah H.", "ReviewID": "XHLj6Sn0xzY2-nEDyS2fPA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very delicious!!I had the seared tuna and my bf had the elk ribeye (which he nawed to the bone). \u00a0Both were great but the best part of the night was the bread pudding souffle!!It was as I expected Commanders Palace to be even though it was super packed the Saturday before V-Day. \u00a0Def recommend for special occasions with a group.", "Date": "2011-02-22", "Author_Location": "New Orleans, LA"}, {"Author": "Stephen G.", "ReviewID": "hAai86SMJBsCM4sWZroreQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Every once in a while, if you're lucky, you come across a meal that is so extraordinary that it leaves you lost for words spiraling into an endless food coma. \u00a0I left Commander's Palace wondering how soon I could fly back down to NOLA.After eating at many high-end restaurants in NOLA over the last 6 days, Commander's Palace stood out far beyond the rest. \u00a0The entire dining experience was spectacular. \u00a0The appetizers, soups, and desserts (must get the Creole bread pudding) were fantastic, but if I had to choose a highlight of the meal, I would have to go with the entrees. \u00a0The Gulf Fish and Dry Aged Breast of Covey Rise Duck were some of the best entrees I've ever had. \u00a0Dry aged duck? \u00a0I have never heard of such a thing. \u00a0The duck breast at Commander's could be one of the best dishes in country! \u00a0Crispy on the outside, tender in the inside, I'm not sure how it can get better than this dish.

I'll start with the good - their bread pudding should be ordered at all costs. You have to place your order for it at the start of the meal as it takes some time to make and is done so individually. Totally worth it. Everything else was kind of a disaster. Two friends of mine ordered the steak and seemed pleased with it but why would I go to a creole restaurant in NO and order steak? I have Houston travels for that kind of thing. All the other items we received were, quite frankly, mediocre at best. If the entrees cost something in the range of $15 - $18, I would have been ok with it. But at close to $40, it was pretty disappointing.Then, and our waiter seemed perfectly lovely, but completely incompetent. My friend ordered a scotch. We waited while all the other drinks were delivered. Then we asked for it again. Then we waited. Finally we asked for it a third time. And received the wrong one. Awesome. During every single course, they brought the wrong dish. My friend was digging around in his entree looking for the soft shelled crab before asking the waiter where it was - he noted that he had not been served the dish he ordered. Oops! Then, after a long wait, it came. He took a few bites, reported it wasn't that good and passed. WTF? If you're ordering soft shelled crab for $38, it should be really, really good! Also, they claimed that they had a 'year round' menu which, I thought I had seen online and basically had chosen to go here based on the fact that they had crab cakes. Then we showed up and, no crab cakes! Disappointing but I wouldn't have minded had anything else been spectacular. Which it wasn't.Then came desert. Picture this: you're the waiter and you've f*cked up every single round of food (and even drinks). Wouldn't you apply extra focus and get the deserts right? Yeah, I would too. But instead he actually brought one of my friends the exact wrong dish. Totally blew me away. We were all baffled.At one point, they did bring us a round of shots we hadn't ordered to make up for the mistakes. They weren't very good. It was also awkward when the waiter said that it was Hemingway's favorite drink. Once he walked away, I noted that a) Hemingway was a total alcoholic, b) later killed himself. We started joking that they were going to bring us the special 'Koresh shots'. We weren't sure if he was trying to say we should all off ourselves although we hadn't had any negative encounters, on a social level, with the staff. Again, blown away. But I would have rather had them comp the rounds they f*cked up instead of giving me a round of shots I didn't order.In the end, we tipped just over 10% and elected to not even mention that they f*cked up the bill too.

The result is supposed to be this airy creamsicle of a concoction served in a highball glass. Instead the result was a frothy mix of white (this is slowly starting to sound like the definition of a SANTORUM) in a short glass. Not gonna lie, it was the worst Ramos I've ever had. BUT WAIT...it gets better.APPETIZERS: Gumbo, Turtle SoupBetween the two of us we had the obligatory turtle soup and the thick, dark, hearty and delicious gumbo. Best I've had, and personally I liked it better than the turtle soup. The opposite was true for the biff. As apprehensive as I was about having turtle soup (had it once and it wasn't perfect. Also it was in Malaysia...) it was a really nice tangy soup. Reminded me oddly of Panda Express's hot and sour soup, in the best way of course! Looked like it too!MAIN COURSE: Pecan crusted redfish, Scallops over Louisiana rice, mushrooms, tomatoes, and greens.Man, the main course was fucking awesome (pardon my Louisiana French)! The red fish was traditionally found in the Mississippi, but due to overfishing is now mostly farm-raised. Despite that, this piece of fish was heaven. Call it the chicken of the fish farm....mmmmmm.The scallops were on a whole new level. Every sense was engaged at all times. The 4 tastes, spice and the elusive umami (no msg here though) tooooooo. Scallops were perfectly tender and not remotely rubbery. Pure perfection.DESSERT: Bread Pudding Souffle with Whiskey Cream SauceLet me start by saying overly sweet desserts gross me out and the biff \"doesn't like dessert.\" But like the turtle soup, this dish was obligatory. All I can now say is WOW! What a complex and amazing dish despite being high on the sweet end of the spectrum. The waiter drizzled the whiskey cream on top \u00a0and popped the souffle (I wanted to do that...) to get it on the inside too. Left the rest on the side for our pleasure. You can really taste the whiskey in the whiskey cream if you eat it on its own, but it is magic with the souffle. We got our check and paid $150 (including tip) for 4 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, and a dessert. With food and service like this I would expect to pay close to $300 dollars in Boston or New York Service was both polite and personable which is a hard hard balance to strike. The girl two tables over despite being obnoxoiusly loud ( and cute) provided me and the biff great entertainment; too bad you probably won't have the pleasure when you go. As a tourist and a local this place is a must.

Partially because, with 575 reviews, what could little 'ole me possibly have to say about Commander's Palace that would be in any way original? But February has a been a little rough thus far, and I'd like to take a trip back in time...to the faraway days of October 2011...to my beloved New Orleans and the beautiful Garden District and that wonderful building with the blue-and-white awnings on Washington Ave across the street from Lafayette cemetery. ***It was my 30th birthday. A weekend jaunt to New Orleans was the only thing that kept me from spending the day crying whilst eating a pound of chocolate and examining my face for wrinkles in the mirror. For the grand finale of our weekend of eating I chose dinner at Commander's Palace. It was the reputation of the famous Bread Pudding Souffle that drew me in. You enter the restaurant and it smells FANTASTIC. We were greeted by a line of servers smiling brightly and exclaiming, \"Welcome in!,\" \"Welcome In!.\" It was early, so maybe they had nothing better to do, but it was quite charming. My ridiculous husband made the regrettable decision to tell the hostess that we were celebrating my birthday. Balloons were tied to my chair and I was presented with a crazy-looking (and quite tall) paper hat that I was told I had to wear throughout dinner. It was bizarre to experience this classy, expensive meal while looking like an attendee at a children's party. Our waitress (who was wonderful) suggested a complicated-sounding drink called the Holly Berry. I think it involved pomegranate liquor. Whatever it was it had me feelin' fine in no time. My husband had something manly-sounding that made him feel like Don Draper. We were brought a plate of garlic bread. It was perfect. Not too oily, plenty of seasoning, light, crunchy bread - spectacular. And this was only the bread! First course was turtle soup. It was interesting. Turtle seems to be a bland-ish meat that assumes the flavor of whatever it's cooked with. It had a nice spiciness to it, but I don't know that I'd order it again. For my entree I chose the Char-Grilled Pork Tenderloin. Smoked pork with a wonderful sugary glaze, served over sweet potato hash, with garlic spinach, with a spicy peach sauce. I don't think there was a morsel left on my plate. Husband had crab cakes and was very envious of my dish. And now we come to the high point of this tale. Bread Pudding Souffle. Bread Pudding is a special hobby of mine. My love of carbohydrates and my love of sugar combined in one blessed creation. Commander's Palace puts a layer of meringue on top of a bread pudding base, hence the Souffle part. It is, without a doubt, the best bread breading I have ever tasted. It may even be my favorite dessert ever, but I'm not quite ready to make a judgment like that. After a few bites, I looked up at my husband and said, \"I would become a conservative christian If it meant that I could go to heaven and eat this every day for the rest of eternity.\" That's high praise. Now, coming from Austin, where jeans and a t-shirt are acceptable for all occasions, I loved dressing up for dinner and the formality of the whole thing. This is old-school southern dining at its finest. And yet, it didn't feel \"stuffy\" AT ALL. Everyone was so friendly. My husband, Mr. Friendly, made a joke about the constant refilling of the water glasses (see: my Aquarelle [RIP] review) and the gentleman with the water said, in a serious-yet-friendly tone, \"Well, we can't have the ice melting, now can we?\"It's just an all-around beautiful restaurant with amazing food, an out-of-this world fantastic desert, and great service.

When we called the man who answered became very stuck up when we asked how egregious would it be if we were late a couple of minutes to our reservation, telling us that we should \"consider yourself lucky\" that they would even accept a reservation this last minute. This made me wonder how condescending the staff was going to be when we actually got there.We arrived in time for our reservation. I love how a restaurant as famous as Commander's is tucked away in a residential neighborhood. The light blue exterior was modest and antiquated, but the interior decor was updated and pretty modern that made me feel like I stepped into a rich person's home! Also I really enjoyed the live music and the colorful balloons they have for Sunday Brunch. It was very festive and memorable. It looked like they had a special menu design for Sunday Brunch too...it was super cute.I was excited that everything I wanted to try was offered for brunch. I ordered the Turtle Soup, Eggs Couchon, and Creole Bread Pudding. My friend ordered the Commander's salad, Eggs Couchon, and Creole Cheesecake. Turtle soup...this was my first time trying it and I really wanted to love it, but it didn't make a huge impression on me - I would describe the taste as a yummy tomato soup with chicken bits. This is probably my general sentiment towards turtle soup in general though as I'm sure Commander's version is one of the best out there. My friend's salad...well, it came with a bacon dressing, enough said.The eggs couchon were delicious. It was basically two poached eggs over biscuits with tons of pork and sauce. It was great, but insanely heavy. Our biggest mistake was that we both loaded up on the garlic bread they gave us beforehand because halfway through the dish we were STUFFFED. It was such a struggle trying to eat the other half, but we tried and failed. Oh well!Then I remembered I still had the bread pudding to tackle. Good god, I had no idea how I would handle this. It was oozing hot and came with a cream sauce. Again, I wasn't WOWed, but this was my first bread pudding ever and, like the turtle soup scenario, I probably just don't love bread pudding in general. BUT, \u00a0it was good enough that I was able to finish 3/4 of it! My friend's cheese cake was great - I like dthat it was less sweet than the NY cheesecake I'm used to.To comment on the service, I was so relieved that all the staff was very nice and welcoming.

Words cannot describe how delicious it was! For my entree I decided to go with something a little different for me - the crab salad. I was not disappointed - it was absolutely delicious. Huge pieces of the freshest crab imaginable tossed in a really nice vinaigrette. To end our meal we shared the praline parfait. It was nice and light and perfect for sharing after lunch.One funny experience to note - we were seated up against a mirror.

Save a few bills, gather a few good friends, everybody dress up nice, take the red line trolley and walk a few blocks to Commander's. Be sure to leave some time to check out the cemetery across the street before or after.This was the highlight not just of the food I had during a week in New Orleans, but of anything I did (food or non-food). We went for the Commander's Jazz Brunch, a 3 course prix fixe meal that includes appetizer, entree and dessert. The interior is great, very spacious with several different dining areas and dripping with old world charm. The food. Oh, the food. Gives me a little shiver just to think about it. Everything on my plate and everyone else's looked great, and judging from the contented murmurs and mutterings throughout, everyone I was sitting with enjoyed all their fare at least as much as I enjoyed mine. I was close to stuffed by the end of the second course and in a full-on food coma by the time I left.My appetizer was a trio of soups (gumbo, shrimp mulligatawny, and turtle soup). Each one was unbelievable and very different from the other two, so that made a nice tasting sampler to get the meal started. The entree, however, was what really sticks in my mind. It was a crawfish, crab, and seafood courtboullion, served with a poached egg and a little cake of potato grits underneath to basically make it the most insane, decadent, and delicious Eggs Benedict I've ever had. The dessert (a caramel apple coffee cake ith a crispy wafer-thin slice of cinnamon bun, ) was so-so, but that may also have been because I was already full by the time it arrived, so I couldn't really do more than choke down a few bites. It tasted fine, but after the first two courses suddenly that wasn't enough for me.At least as enjoyable as the food itself: the trio of musicians (banjo, standup bass, and trumpet/vocals) that wandered from table to table playing requests. The trumpet player/singer had a pretty good Louie Armstrong voice, and all of the music was upbeat, lively and fun, just as you'd expect in a scene out of old New Orleans. It really added a whole extra layer of enjoyment to an already stellar meal.The only downside to this meal is that now I shall forever hold all lesser meals in a bit of disregard.

I'm going to say salty, but too much sherry was added at the table (perhaps there was already too much in it for my taste when it left the kitchen.)I was also rather disappointed by my crawfish and mushroom salad, a special at the time. Maybe the menu stated it and I completely missed it, but I did not expect the crawfish preparation to be deep-fried. Not here. I know that's the NOLA way, outside of a crawfish boil, but that's exactly what I expected: boiled. The crawfish were little pieces of friedness (at least a fair amount of them), topping a very measly serving of greens and only two mushrooms. Two!

I ordered the three course meal of their famous turtle soup, scallops, and strawberry shortcake. (which had to be ordered at the beginning of the meal so they had enough prep time)The turtle soup came with a warm baguette wrapped in a cloth. It wasn't cut and it didn't come with a knife, so I assumed the two of us were supposed to tear it up with out hand and dip it into the soup. It seemed slightly odd in such a fancy place. If there is one thing that the soup flavor reminded me of, it is vomit. But vomit prepared by excellent chefs! I finished the bowl, but didn't like it a whole lot.I got the pan seared(?) scallops encrusted with some spice or other which were served on a variety of grains. They weren't wheatberries, but the had a similar tough-ish consistency, I think they were varieties of rice mostly. On each side was a pool of their butter sauce with streaks of something that was a light emerald green and translucent. Scallops plus butter sauce were absolutely incredible. Wow. Just perfect. The grains were a bit too powerful to eat in the same bite with scallop, but on their own mixed with butter sauce, they were excellent, but what wouldn't be with that sauce?By the time I got the strawberry shortcake I was getting pretty full and couldn't finish it, but I could still easily recognize how great it was. It basically looked like a big cream puff surrounded by strawberries and sauce. The shell, instead of soft and chewy like most cream puffs, was crispy and crumbly. The bottom was pound cake that had soaked up some of the sauce, but not enough to get soggy. The whipped cream on the inside was just perfect. Light and rich, sweet, but not overly so.

The BBQ was great but the flavor of the sauce overpowered the oyster.Next was the Foie Gras Du Monde. The chefs homage to Cafe Du Monde and their wonderful Beignet. I would not say that this was a beignet as it almost seemed fried but it was incredibly tasty and a nice accompaniment to the foie gras.A palate cleanser called a Strega Snowball came though it was horrible.Soft shell blue crab was next. Perfect. Crispy, not oily, fried crab with what seemed to be a cornbread batter. Excellent.Antelope was the main course. I had never had it before but was pleasently surprised. They are farm raised in Texas for CP. They are grilled and served rare and was an excellent dish.The Bread Pudding Souffle w/ Whiskey sauce was terrific.

Otherwise, it was interesting: I imagined a green goo, but it came out like a meaty beef stew (couldn't tell what turtle actually tastes like). Portion size was decent.

No overpowering fishy/oyster-y smell or taste; cooked in some sort of light garlic-y broth with collards, amazing. If it is on the menu and you half like oysters, get this dish.I also got the gumbo, very good. Duck and sausage that day. One of the best gumbos I have had and I have had plenty and make my own as well.I also got the couchon de lait--pork. Didn't really know what to expect, came out room temp. Still tasted pretty good. Didn't look right to Martin, he actually asked the temp and I said it was cool. He took it back and it took some time to get the replacement but well worth it. The dish came out much flatter after fats and other good things melted down and the taste of the pork was phenomenal. Definitely get this as well.Tried my friend's turtle soup, honestly wasn't too impressed. Also agree with others, not sure if it was the sherry but had a bit of a bitter taste.Also got the bread pudding souffle. Guess I was hungry that day. Probably would be a while before I was back in town so had to try as much as I could. This was also a must dish. Great souffle, wonderful texture and taste.Incidentally, didn't really think the 25 cent martinis were that strong but hey, it's 25 cents. This is a no brainer restaurant to at least try once. Martin wasn't exactly the most bubbly person in the world but very professional. His \"helpers\" took more of the bubbly role. We ate at 11:30 am on a Friday, right when it opened. Service was good. Maybe a tad on the slower side but still fine. Yes, bad service sucks but I feel sad for other reviewers who would give up eating this food again because someone had an off night.

For our entr\u00e9es, he had shrimp and grits in a cognac sauce that was really fabulous, and I had the eggs cochon de lait, which was totally perfect, even if I could only finish half of it due to extreme fullness.

Around since 1880, Commander's Palace is history served on a platter. The restaurant is located in the Garden District directly across from the famous Lafayette Cemetery. So, on a foggy day in late December the Count and I embarked on a a culinary journey through time to Commander's Palace. As soon as we sat down, we were served martinis, warm bread and butter.

We ordered the special that came with choice of soup/salad, main entree, and dessert. The complimentary garlic bread had lots of garlic and butter. I thought it was strange that the restaurant also gave a complimentary french bread loaf. Overall, the food was good. For the appetizers, I had the salad with greens, strawberries, pecans, and cheese, It was an okay salad with the vinegarette. Nothing popped with the salad. In addition, I didn't understand why the strawberry stems were still on the fruit. My hubby had the turtle soup. The spicy creole flavor was strong and it was too salty. He would not order turtle soup again.For the main entree, my hubby had the Crawfish Maque Choux. The dish had crawfish tails with corn, peppers, okra, Creole tomatoes, and crawfish sauce with Louisiana popcorn rice and crispy bacon. Good spicy sauce and lots of crawfish! I had the Griddle Seared Gulf Fish, which came with red beans, edamame, grilled trinity, corn, and gulf shrimp with pressed herbs and smoky tomato butter. Fish cooked perfectly, but really salty with the seasoning. Loved the beans and the greens. For dessert, we both ordered the Creole Bread Pudding Souffle. So awesome! It was light, sugary, and had alcohol with the sauce. Highly recommended.Service was impeccable and efficient. At one point, one of the staff members saw us drinking too much ice water within a short amount of time. He completely swapped out our half drunk cup of water with a full cup that had a lot more ice.

They were very insistent to take our time, our table would be ready when we were. I had The Adelaide Swizzle...it was one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. I had a few more throughout the night, as well as the Crescent City Cooler which, despite the cheezy name, was ultimate refreshment in a glass. When we were ready, the bartender called the maitre'd and someone was sent back to collect us. Another short jaunt through the kitchen (which is always so educational!) and we were seated in the main dining room. The restaurant is beautiful; with fabric paneled walls, wooden chandeliers and beautiful wall paper. The tables are spaced apart just right; you overhear no one else's conversation. The menu is compact and complete; all the bases are covered with just enough originality to make it seem fresh, but not grandiose. The wine menu is overwhelming in it's choice and has many price points for all budgets. We went with a pinot noir that our waiter recommended, based on our tastes. We were both very pleased. I started with the turtle soup. Take me home and put me to bed; I still think about that turtle soup. Light and nearly citrusy but warm and earthy at the same time. Perfection. My main course was a fried soft-shell crab. Sadly, I didn't enjoy it that much. It was served with avacado and other cool vegetables and it just didn't seem to match the crab well. The flavors were off for me. My husbands infused pork was incredible. For desert, we went big and got the table-side prepared bananas foster *and* the bread pudding souffle. The table-side preparation was quite the show; fun to watch and even more fun to eat. It was extraordinary; perfectly caramelized, with just enough alcohol still left to give it depth. The souffle my husband wouldn't let me touch; he's a bread pudding fanatic and this was, apparently, the best he'd ever had.I enjoyed my experience at the Commander's Palace from start to finish, soup to nuts. The service is perfect, the food was excellent, the drinks, both mixed and wine, were right on point.

It's an old school southern restaurant, where business casual attire is expected for lunch with no beachwear or jeans allowed. The food was very good - GREAT, actually! I was there for lunch on 7/10 and had the boneless black angus short ribs that were served with mustard and sour cream smashed potatoes - YUMMY!!!!! It really was perfection on a plate. My husband ordered the sugar cane grilled pork which was very juicy and a little sweet - absolutely delightful. Everything was so good that we both made happy plate, and it should be noted that they were generous portions for an upscale restaurant. For desert we had the bread pudding souffle with a whiskey sauce - It's something that you simply cannot miss out on. At some point in your life, you MUST go to CP and order this desert. The dining experience that you get @ Commander's is parallel to none. During lunch, you are surrounded by the wealthy housewives of New Orleans in what they call \"social luncheons\". They have a $0.25 martini menu, which almost everyone takes advantage of. The servers use phrases such as \"May I get you a libation?\"-- That's a southern way of saying, \"Can I get you something from the bar?\" And, \"Has your drink expired?\" These are the little things that really do make this a standout experience in my book.

To start, we had the a fried oyster over a incredibly savory creamed corn and bacon (no longer on menu) and their Seasonal preparation of Foie Gras. Both were ecstasy. Especially the Foie Gras. They give a generous portion, perfectly seared, and their always marrying this rich and decadent cut with a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The fried oyster and creamed corn small plate was gone before it hit the table. Then we moved on to the 1-1-1 Soup (Gumbo, Turtle, and Du Jour), all were good, but a little salty.

I feel this should not be gone without trying, the pressed egg is really an interesting texture and binder for the whole salad. We had two entrees that are no longer on the menu.

Our experience: decent food with flashes of brilliance, awesome decor and spotty service.A little more detail: first, the food. By far, the best dishes were the pecan-encrusted local fresh fish (it was sheepshead that night), which was so much lighter and more flavorful than I expected. The gumbo was excellent. The app with shrimp, okra, pickled onion and some kind of tabasco sauce was absolutely fantastic. Boyfriend's filet was delicious and prepared perfectly. The rest of the dishes were good, though not as exceptional: the turtle soup was a bit salty and not as flavorful as I'd have liked (especially after the terrific gumbo). The oyster \"dome\" was odd though good, but it didn't entirely work for me. The pecan pie was very good but still, not amazing.The service was spotty. Crystal was a ray of light: she always had a huge smile, she called us \"sweeties,\" she gave us some great tips for the meal. Our main server was very nice and took good care of us but there were moments where he seemed to disappear for a few minutes and we were hanging out waiting for him to come back. And the assistant server/busboy (really, the kid couldn't have been more than 18) was strangely informal-- at one point, he brought a plate with 4 pieces of garlic bread, held the plate to show us at the table (so at eye level for us), and said \"fresh garlic bread?\" We said \"sure,\" and waited for him to set the plate down. We all sat there for a beat and then he said \"just grab some, we're informal here.\" Ummm-- ?! Ok? Maybe we don't want a piece right now? But ok, so we used our fingers and took a piece each, and then he set the plate (with the remaining 2 pieces) down on the table. For such a super formal fine-dining place, that was very odd moment.Finally, the ambience: I LOVE old restaurants and this place bordered on kitschy. There are six dining rooms (seven if you could the outdoor patio) and our server was AWESOME and gave us a tour of the whole place (including the amazing wine cellar), which was very cool of him. Loved seeing the whole place. Loved the outdoor garden area (wish it had been warmer that night, we would have hung out there!). The only sour note is the bar, which seemed like a HUGE missed opportunity. They sent everyone to the bar to wait while their tables were being prepared, so it was busy, but the bar was very blah and looked very 80s... pale wood, not much personality. Can't believe they don't redo it to be really cool and fun.Overall: I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars and settled on 3 because they set the expectations so highly. If CP wasn't promising a \"10 out of 10\" experience then I probably would have rated them higher. But for about $250 for the two of us-- and we DIDN'T drink that much-- and for the reputation that proceeds the Palace, I saw more than a few situations where they really could step up their game.", "Date": "2013-04-05", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Kush M.", "ReviewID": "rJyL5WYxT-gDJ__ROuB-bg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to coming out to the South, me and my friends heard a lot about Commander's as being one of the best restaurants in Nawlins.

But when I do, I have to let everyone else know what they're missing. Commander's Palace is one of those places.Tucked away in what seems like a converted house in the middle of suburban sprawl outside of New Orleans, this restaurant initial provided me with very low expectations of what is the behold me beyond the kitchen doors. The ambiance inside was inviting with light blue wall paper and what looked like stuffed birds along the walls, giving the illusion that you are eating outdoors I guess..Getting to the brass tax, my girlfriend and I both ordered various fish entrees as this place is known for its amazing seafood menu. She ordered a Blackened Drum fish which was basically like the consistency of chicken (she loved this because she normally hates seafood). I on the other hand, ordered the catch of the day which escapes me at the moment but it was just fishy enough but also blackened exactly right so that it was tolerable and very tasty with the corn, beans and reduction sauce that it was served in. The portions were also very good, I was full after the fish, which rarely happens.Going totally out of order, I decided to save the best part of the meal for now. I ordered their famous Turtle Soup. Not because it said that it takes 3-days to prepare this soup more so because I will never be able to get Turtle soup again when I get back to the DC area. The meat was as tender as possible and similar to a beef stew but with a ton more flavor thanks to the sherry-infused stock it was cooked in. Amazing, again.Lastly we got a birthday surprise (being it was the girlfriend's bday) of a candle inserted into a bread pudding souffle dessert. I had no more room to eat but I had to down a few spoons of this, it was worth the ensuring stomach pains I suffered a few minutes later from overeating.I was impressed with the fact that the servers actually treated this restaurant like a true 5-star establishment by serving everything simultaneously for all parties at the table, a sign that you are eating in a place that really cares.I don't have to be the one to tell to eat here, just look at the other 500+ reviews.

Our lagniappe (everyone in the room got one...) was a bland and tiny boudin ball with a squirt of creole mustard on it. I've had more flavorful at roadside stands.Leftover banquet hors d'ouvre perhaps?The champagne and strawberry salad was so promising and looked great when it arrived but the salad mix was odd and shot through with weird greens which were slimy and felt more like seaweed than salad. Good flavors but the half ounce of St. Andre was insulting for an $8 salad.The house salad had decent enough flavor but the romaine was almost shredded (odd) and the house made bacon was this pulverized and almost non-existent powder with a very strange taste not reminiscent of bacon at all.My fiancee ordered a vodka martini and was given a gin martini which they relplaced in their own sweet time.Our entrees arrived and we were surprised to see them on what looked banquet room salad plates. Tiny and cold, they sported my black drum which was paired with a sauce too thick and peppery. My poor fiancee's steak was a disaster. He ordered the filet MR and it arrived barely rare. He was content to suffer through it and the apparent lack of mushrooms, sauce and potatoes until he got to the grey spot in the middle of the 40 dollar filet and decided to send it back.Even though they took the steak off the bill all we got from the server was a shrug and a \"sorry bout your steak\". No offer of dessert or a cocktail. Bad form.The bread pudding souffle (which we had to order at the beginning of the meal and still had to wait for awkwardly after our entree plates were whisked away) was good but not nearly as good as others we have had in the city.Pound for pound, between the hurried, swarming and \u00a0perfunctory service, the poorly executed food and the 70's country club ambience of the \"garden room\", we wouldn't ever bother again to explore the menu and spectacular wine list further.It feels like they are resting on the strength of their reputation.

The turtle was good but they put too much sherry in it table-side, so ask them to do a tiny bit!! The gumbo was great, if not a bit too peppery, but with delicious large pieces of tender oyster...mmm)2) Cosmo martini (for the 25 cent special). We tried them all, the Cosmo is by far the best, slightly sweet but without the fake syrupy taste of most cheap martinis. Personally I hated the Commander's special martini, which is bright blue and tasted acrid. The melon was okay, but also tasted of that cheap, fake martini flavor that I hate. We also got a plain ole dirty martini (with vodka not gin), which was good but a bit strong for my taste. 3) \"Blackened Drum\" entree. Delicious, tender fish. Light meal and perfect portion, not to small but just right. On a bed of arugula and sprinkled with pickled merliton (which I usually don't like). \u00a0Not Best: I actually did not like my entree that much.

I felt as though I was one of those important businessmen or I had money for days. The restaurant itself is located in the garden district about two or three blocks away from Magazine St. which is full of antique shops and classic stores a very fitting location for such a historic, classy restaurant such as commanders palace. I would pass by the place often and wonder what it was like inside. Well, I found out and was it an experience. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The restaurant had this very strict dress code (for guys suit and tie/tuxedo; for girls dress) I was not bothered by the dress code due to the fact it only added to the experience.

He asked for our drinks I had a sweet tea (too young for wine). We still were not ready to order so he said he will come back later. It took a while for me to decide given I would had to read each dish before making a choice. We decided on shrimp for an appetizer (Shrimp & Tasso Henican) and I chose gumbo as my main course (gumbo du jour) . The most shocking part of this restaurant was the service. My drink never reached half way while deciding to order and after I was given the second refill my glass was replaced with another full glass of ice cold sweet tea. The shrimp were big and tasted so fresh. The spiciness added to the shrimp would hit you after a few chews but they it added a distinct flavor to it. As if the spiciness was more of a seasoning than a flavor. It completely changed my outlook on shrimp. It also helped that I had a fresh glass of tea often. I had already fallen in love with the restaurant.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Continuing with the spice theme I received my bowl of gumbo filled with all the classic ingredients (shrimp, Okra, sausage, etc.) add the fact that it has been grilled to perfection. Just as advertised on the menu. My dad had some type of fish or something but I did not care because I was too busy enjoying feeling like a king. I was always asked if the food was ok, given some complementary bread, and the refills just kept coming. As I gulped down the last of my gumbo. (which may or may not have been inappropriate, probably was) my bowl was removed and utensils taken. I ordered another bowl yes another bowl and they came out with a noticeably bigger helping and more bread. The food was downed yet again. The waiter asked are you satisfied? I said no I would like dessert. They asked what I would like and held the menu for me as I looked through the menu!! At that point I felt like Barack Obama, or Denzel Washington, or Michael Jordan when they go to a normal restaurant. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dessert was disappointing. It wasn't bad but it didn't have me jumping for joy. I wanted to tell my servants to bring it back and try again.

We were seated right on time, and ordered some wine. The garlic bread that they bring out to start is absolutely delicious, it was hard not to fill up on it. As for food, I had the creole cream cheese crawfish gnocchi, Commander's salad, and filet mignon.

Well eff that! Since this is one of the finest and most storied restaurants not only in New Orleans, but also of the entire USA I am adding one more. Plus I want the bragging rights that comes with dining in a special place such as Commander's Palace. This was my 3rd time visiting and the service is so good it teeters on being over the top. Almost. But the staff here are so professional and caring that it never reaches that point. Our waiter Roch was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was hilarious as well. One of the most enjoyable dining experiences I have ever had. Also enhanced by the roving trio, which were also fun loving guys. My nephew jokingly requested King of The Road, and they insisted on giving it their best even though they didn't know all of the words. Some of us...ahem...even helped them along. Does that help convince you that this is not a stuffy place? Hopefully, because that is my point. These people are all about their guests having the time of their life. And we definitely did. And the food? Also incredible to match the service. My brunch entr\u00e9e was the \"Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish\", which was drum fish on this day. Came topped with Prosecco poached Louisiana crabmeat, with pecans floating in the sauce that surrounded the fish. Excellent! Ordered the \"Creole gumbo\" as a starter, but one of my table mates had the turtle soup, and it definitely outshone my very good gumbo. Very rich and flavorful, probably one of the best soups I have ever had the pleasure of partaking. For desert I pre-ordered the bread pudding souffl\u00e9, and it was divine with the Roch recommended Quady \"Essencia\" Orange Muscat from California. Speaking of which, the wine prices are very reasonable. $8.50 for their branded chardonnay, that was more than drinkable. They even make a show of their \"Classic Bloody Mary\" by spiking it tableside with \"ice block\" vodka, and is mixed with their \"award-winning housemade Bloody Mary mix.\" \u00a0Sounds like a $15 bloody Mary huh? Nope, a lousy $6.75.So there you have it, one more superlative review of the legendary Commander's Palace.

Simply the soup was not hot and the kids were served a dessert they did not order.The kids asked for an ice cream sundae - ice cream and chocolate syrup. The waitress said she didn't know if they could do that. She ordered molten chocolate for them - a hot brownie-like cake with ice cream and syrup. The kids were disappointed and didn't eat the $8.50 desserts. It aggravated the adults because we know if we had spoken with the captain or asked for Lally Brennan we would have been served properly. We didn't speak up and now have this incident stuck in our minds when we think of our holiday lunch. Partly our fault.Lunch is a good time to visit Commander's. There are always a couple of lunch specials that are good and come with an appetizer for a reasonable price and 25 cent martinis. I recommend the original shrimp remoulade, duck confit or coulis, gumbo, and shrimp & grits. For dessert the strawberry shortcake is excellant if in season.This is not the 5 star restaurant it has been since my childhood but I am hopeful that Commander's will resurrect itself to its previous status.

LOVED IT- They would not serve alcohol out on the patio, but you could take your own drink there. I started with the Sangria, which was pretty yummy. Sitting out on the patio, with the live fish swimming in the little pond, Sangria in hand, rounds of good stories to go by - I was a happy creature! Chatter told me the virgin mojitos were real good, the Hibiscus Martini was ok, the sazarac was the bomb!

Whatever it was, my hostess (in a green top and a nasty frown) stopped our party (18 odd people), in the MIDDLE OF THE KITCHEN and made us wait for 10 minutes, in between all the servers hurrying around with food, people waiting to get past us to the patio, so she could make sure we had closed our tab!!! I COULD NOT believe her, when she said that, and made 18 people wait in a little passageway meant for maybe 2 people.. absolutely ridiculous! NOT A FAN. When we finally motioned her to lead, saying we had paid up - she was like 'Are you sure the tab is closed'? People simply rolled their eyes at her and shrugged - she waited to get a signal from the bartender.. WOW!- Finally seated, private room, 3 very very excellent people to serve us, we got over the little glitch and proceeded on to dinner. Wine selections are really good, I loved the Cabernet, and my server made sure my glass was never less than half full! :) The service itself was excellent, never intruding, but always adequate. Now for the food - we ordered a LOT of different dishes, and here is what I thought - Appetizers - White Shrimp Remoulade - Yum! The vinaigrette was very very tasty!- Shrimp & Tasso Henican - Succulent jumbo shrimp, I loved this too.- I heard the fois gras was yummy tooSoup/Salad-- The gumbo was very hearty and yummy- Turtle soup - Just so so- Soup De jour - meh- Commander's salad - nothing specialEntrees -- Pecan crusted gulf fish - very dry and tasteless for some reason! The server totally sold us on the dish, but it did not deliver unfortunately!- Seared Scallops - Pretty decent- Seared Gulf fish - my own entree, very disappointing! The mushrooms were super yum, everything else fell flat. Very tasteless :( I could barely taste the smokey tomato butter!- Filet Mignon - Both people who ordered, had maybe 1/4th of their dishes! nothing great about it!Desserts -Bread pudding - Highly disappointing from what I heard around the table.

mostly locals celebrating Valentine's Day at that point, but later to fill up substantially with well dressed beaded folks who talked excitedly of the parade - clearly this was a Sunday night when dining late was expected and the servers never missed a beat. \u00a0Coffee served, a rich and nutty blend with notes of cocoa and chicory, I actually had to request that they slow down on the refills of it because I was having difficulty balancing my sweetener with the frequent warm-ups.Shortly following placing my order I received Commander's Palace's famous garlic bread - essentially a pan grilled French bread soaked in garlic butter, parmesan, and chives - it was excellent and I managed two plates without difficulty. \u00a0Later in the meal (with the main course) the garlic bread was replaced by a crusty and buttery French bread - a tad tough and chewy on the interior, but certainly not bad - and a grassy salted butter.For my first dish of the evening - my first experience with Turtle Soup. \u00a0Requested as merely a taste my server informed me that it would be no problem to receive a portion from the \"Soup 1-1-1\" for a mere $3 and I was thrilled. \u00a0Splashed with some sherry table the stock itself had a spicy yet sour flavor that I quite liked - what didn't work, however, was the turtle meat itself...dry, gritty, almost \"sandy\" if you will. \u00a0Having heard similar reviews from a couple of respected gourmands I assume this is largely what turtle meat tastes like and while it was certainly an experience I think I'd have much preferred the turtle soup sans turtle.My second dish of the evening, another CP classic, was an absolute winner - \"Oyster & Absinthe Dome.\" Similar to clam chowder in texture the creamy and hearty soup featured heavy hints of cream, garlic, oysters and their liquor, artichokes, and what I do believe was a smoky bacon. \u00a0Topping the amalgam and adding even more texture to the already complex soup was a large puff pastry that I chopped into the soup carefully to avoid spillage. \u00a0While I can't say I tasted much of what I could identify as absinthe or anise in the dish, what I did taste was sublime.Dish three - well, dish three and four were the reason I elected to dine at CP's for dinner instead of lunch or brunch. \u00a0Described beautifully by both my primary server and the young man who delivered it to my table, the chef's take on the classic beignets and caf\u00e9 au lait entitled \"Foie Gras du Monde\" was another of my top 5 savories experienced in New Orleans. \u00a0Featuring a perfectly cleaned 2-3oz portion of unctuous foie gras served over top two light and airy beignets stuffed with an admixture of pecan and foie mousse and topped with warm sugarcane chicory syrup on the left half of the plate while the right half of the dish displayed a glass of sweetened caf\u00e9 au lait and foie gras foam - it was every bit as decadent as it sounds. \u00a0An admitted fan of sweeter foie gras preparations I'd say that this was my second favorite seared foie gras preparation to date - an absolute must order, especially at the bargain price of $18. \u00a0(for reference my favorite seared preparation was $35 at L2O and my favorite cold preparation the $30 supplement at The French Laundry.)For my main course - once again it was the duck - and it was my second favorite duck of the trip. \u00a0 Entitled \"Cracklin' Crusted Duck\" the evening's preparation featured a quartered duck that perfectly pan seared medium and coated with crisp and salty pork cracklins'. \u00a0Complimenting the smooth and meaty duck was a ragout of sweet and sour caramelized onions and roasted pecan duck jus along with Jack Daniels buttermilk coush-coush (crispy, sweet, delectable) and a smear of Tabasco jelly. \u00a0Sweet and spicy, savory and sweet, plenty of texture variation - a beautifully executed dish.Wiping my plate clean my server stopped by with a big smile on her face - it must've been pretty obvious how much I was enjoying the experience. \u00a0Asking if she could \"tempt me\" with dessert there wasn't even a question - \"the Bread Pudding Souffle, please.\" \u00a0Refilling my coffee for the...I don't know, probably tenth time...I sat and waited approximately 10 minutes before my server returned with a little cloud of heaven. \u00a0The Queen of Creole dessert to say the least, the dish was indeed exactly what it stated - both a bread pudding and a souffl\u00e9. \u00a0Featuring an airy dome of cinnamon meringue souffl\u00e9 standing tall and proud over the edge of the ramekin and a dense, heavy, custard soaked bread pudding with heavy notes of cinnamon and nutmeg beneath the dish was punctured tableside and filled with a hefty bourbon custard sauce. \u00a0While not the best souffl\u00e9 I've ever tasted and not the best bread pudding I've ever experienced the dish was everything I expected and possibly the best dessert of my trip to New Orleans.", "Date": "2010-02-21", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Ida C.", "ReviewID": "IsrTi1LKDNs5SitbEtLf2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My triumphant return to Commander's Palace was painstakingly plotted. \u00a0After calling and realizing the weekend brunch was completely booked, we enlisted a veritable army of concierges (credit card, hotel and informal) to snap up the first available cancellation. \u00a0We were in luck, and the rest, my friends, is history...then again, I wouldn't dream of keeping the hot and spicy details from you!It was a pleasantly warm, sun-kissed day, ideal for an upscale outdoor picnic in the verdant CP courtyard, resplendent with dozens of frosty, balloon-bedecked champagne buckets and every hue of strappy sundress. \u00a0The acclaimed Southern Hospitality was out in full force: a fantastic jazz trio was playing and it seemed as though we had an entire platoon of charming, well-pressed waiters ready to indulge our every whim. \u00a0I especially enjoyed when one said, \"We have some hot bread baking in the oven and I'll have it out to you in just a minute.\" \u00a0I almost fainted from the bliss. \u00a0And that bread was well worth the drama! \u00a0Crisp, buttery and garlicky toasts cut into small slivers. \u00a0I can't believe I left it out of my first review. \u00a0As before, we went through 3 plates! \u00a0Soooo good. \u00a0Small confession: even though it was already buttery and garlicky and thoroughly flavorful, I still added additional sweet cream butter. \u00a0Bad knife!We continued our gluttony with our actual brunch orders. \u00a0As at dinner, the price of the entr\u00e9e includes appetizer and dessert, and is an amazing deal. \u00a0Everything was delicious and unique!APPETIZERS:1.

Who needs Michelin stars anyway? Who cares that one of the former executive chefs went on to become the one of the worst Food network personalites (in a league with such intolerables as Bobby Flay and Robert Irvine). Who cares that this place used to be a brothel, or that it's one of the ubiquitous Brennan establishments. This place, despite all that it seems to have going against it, is a godsend in a day and age where molecular gastronomy \u00a0is considered \"hip and with it.\" There are no bullshit foams, sous-vides, or liquid nitrogen encapsulations. No. This place is \"inventive classic\" which is exactly what New Orleans stands for. If you want boring and uninventive classic, then try Galatoire's, which is a great place and all, but if you want to be wowed, go and eat at Commander's Palace.I really hate doling out 5-star reviews, because I tend to find imperfections in most all restaurants I go to, and am never really satisfied. Well, I've gotta say I was completely floored upon eating here. I was really expecting it to be all hype, but without a doubt this is probably my favorite restaurant (in the world?). First thing's first. This place is not in any way \"palace-like\". It is not over-indulgent, decadent, or opulent. Though some may find this to their detriment, I thought that it was perfect because while I love fine dining, I do not like overtly stuffy places, and this is in no way stuffy. The space was refined and inviting. You got the feeling that you were dining in a nice restaurant, but you didn't feel like \"oh my God how much is this going to cost me?\" sort of deal. The service is amazing, and typically you'll have a head waiter attend to your table. We had a guy named Todd who was nice and all, but his biggest accolade was how much he knew about the place. I was shocked to discover he'd only been working there a year (I figured New Orleans waiters were typically long-term type of people). Though it took a little while to get started, once we did, Todd was very helpful. He knew a lot about the dishes, as well as the history of the place. I didn't know if Chef Torrie McPhail was still there at Commanders, so I asked Todd. He said, \"yep, he's back in the kitchen. Would you like to go see him?\" This definitely was not something I expected to be offered. While I politefully declined, I did ask for a tour after our meal, since we finished up right after closing time. He politefully obliged, and showed us the kitchen, the courtyard, and even over for a peek at the Brennan residence (from the outside). This guy gets six stars if it were possible. Before I get into the food, let me say that we had a group of six. For bigger groups, I would recommend booking two weeks out if you can. I called a week before, and they were all full. They did tell me to call a few days before in case there's any cancellations, and luckily a table had opened up. Even still, to be on the safe side if you know you'll be eating here, then I recommend booking early. I think it's easier to book for two or four, but do know that reservations are harder to come by. Nothing ridiculous, just a week or two out and you should be good. So into the food (this is what you're dying to read anyway if you haven't already skipped the rest of this review). There were several options on the menu ranging from a la carte dishes to a seven-course tasting menu for two that was $130. There was a three-course reveillon (Christmas) prix-fixe option that was $40, which included a soup of your choice, a choice of hand-selected entrees, and any dessert. $40 may sound like a lot, but for a restaurant like Commander's, I expected it to cost more. $40 seemed like a value to me. So to start the meal, they bring you garlic bread (I know, it sounds de class\u00e9), but the garlic bread was amazing. Light and airy french bread perfectly buttered and toasted in a refined manner. We started with three appetizers to split between six of us. There were two oyster dishes: Oysters Remy, and the Oyster Dome. The Oysters Remy were decently sized gulf oysters fried, atop a bed of local greens with an extremely delicious sauce. This was an excellent dish. The Oyster Dome was not as exciting but still extremely good. It was a baked concotion of oysters, heavy cream, and lord knows what else (artichoke hearts maybe?) The star of the appetizer course was seared Foie Gras. I'm still relatively new to Foie, but compared to the other two times I'd had it, Commander's takes the cake. The foie had a nice char to it, but just instantly melted the second it enters your mouth. It even came with a cafe au lait shooter that paired extremely well with the Foie. The flavors going on in that plate are beyond explainable and are probably one of the dishes I would have served at my final meal.", "Date": "2010-12-31", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Matthew C.", "ReviewID": "9ROpTZQirB8VYKHExmXFRQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm sure the secret is out already, but this is a awesome value for lunch. \u00a0First off, martinis are 25 cents - seriously! \u00a0They limit you to 3, but you should be well on your way after 3 if you know what I mean. \u00a0The 2 course lunch special is the way to go - they range from $18-20 and include a salad or soup. \u00a0I went with the turtle soup - it takes them 3 days to prepare the dish! \u00a0Plus, it was delicious! \u00a0I was able to try both the Couchon de Lait (braised pork shoulder, crawfish boudin over roasted corn and chow chow) and the Seafood Cakes (crab, redfish and shrimp). \u00a0The seafood cakes were ample and had a great smoky flavor. \u00a0The pork shoulder was sweet and tender - it paired well with the crawfish boudin. \u00a0The flavor profile was sweet and savory, plus it was a good amout of food for a lunch portion. \u00a0I couldn't pass on the Bread Pudding Souffl\u00e9. \u00a0It is very light considering it is bread pudding. \u00a0The egg whites that top the bread pudding put an interesting twist on the traditional variation of the dish. \u00a0The whiskey sauce is very good and I liked that it wasn't overly sweet.The service was a little slow I must say. \u00a0I don't know if it was just this particular server or the fact that they were hosting about 4 different birthday parties, but the food and drinks did take a while to come out. \u00a0However, all of the staff was very friendly and it seemed genuine - like they weren't forced to greet you and be polite.Commanders does have a lot of hype in New Orleans and for my lunch experience, they lived up to their billing.", "Date": "2011-07-27", "Author_Location": "Houston, TX"}, {"Author": "Shane L.", "ReviewID": "3IwnNoMnVk-Ak0Nh0YkoCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went for the tasting menu tonight and WOW!

From the warm reception from the host to the bread pudding -- perfection all around! Boyfriend and I came to New Orleans in search of good food and a connection to culture. Disinterested in those Bourbon Street eateries, we asked shop owners where we should dine. Several people said \"Commander's Palace, hands down.\" So there we were! We were seated promptly at 11:30 upstairs in the Garden Room. It was beautiful, light and airy. Apparently, everyone else likes this room as well, as it was packed in no time! Our server was so helpful in recommending items on the menu! We began with the gumbo. This gumbo was rich without being overpowering. It was tasty and smooth. Also, garlic bread is served. That garlic bread is to DIE for! It is buttery, warm and just melts in your mouth. The next course was the main course. I had shrimp and grits (called something else on the menu though) and boyfriend had the quail. Words can't even really describe how good this food was! My grits were creamy (not too creamy, as I hate that!) and the shrimp was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection. Boyfriend's quail was juicy and filled with flavor as well. We thoroughly enjoyed the food as we threw back our 25-cent martinis. Yes, you read that correctly. Ordering an entree will get you up to three martinis for a quarter apiece. They have different flavors and I guess they are ok, but I'm a classic girl myself. I asked for it dirty, with gin and requested they add a splash of vermouth. They did. Wonderful dirty martini! Now here's where this place goes down in history: Bread Pudding Souffle. JESUS take the wheel! Take anything but that souffle! OMG! It comes out looking rather odd. It's a souffle, after all. Well, the server comes over and finishes it tableside with whiskey sauce, smooshing it down a little and drizzling sauce on it. YUM! It can be shared by two even after a pretty substantial meal. This whole restaurant experience was a delight. Don't come here if you're in a rush and can't wait on good food. Good food takes time. But the entire time, you're being attended to, so you never notice. This is a place to have a nice leisurely meal and some cocktails. Worth every penny.

And it wasn't that bad. Once I arrived, the table was ready and after being led through a maze of dining rooms (all full by the way), I got to our table in one of the upstairs dining room - the one with windows along one wall, made for a pretty neighborhood scene. Whilst I waited for my brunch dates, I ordered the Commander's Palace bloody mary (cuz, I was out til 5am!) and loved it. One thing I did notice was the traffic - not from diners but from the wait staff. I counted at least 5 near misses during one bloody mary where a waiter or waitress would nearly collide and drop drinks or food or something else. Once the others joined, we ordered; I had the Shrimp and Tasso Henican and Pork Tenderloin with Eggs. The app was absolutely delicious! Shrimp in a hot sauce beurre with pickled okra swimming in pepper jelly! Fabulous ('cuz ya know hot sauce is my preferred seasoning). The Pork Tenderloin with Eggs was nice but personally I thought it needed something. And yes, you guessed, I asked for some hot sauce! It needed it! I liked the mustardy overall taste of the dish, but it was bland. The hash browns were good as were the sliced pork and sunny side up egg, but some hot sauce went a long way to making it better. Sure some of you might be going, hot sauce at Commander's? Well I would answer that by saying why wouldn't it be! This is New Orleans where the food, like the weather, is hot and spicy! I would like to come back for the regular lunch menu to check out some other interesting things on the menu. The menu is fairly conservative and by that, I mean it's a typical old-school New Orleans menu, tried and true kinda dishes.

It's not just a meal but a memorable experience. WHAT WE ORDERED: the 3 course coolinary dinner, consisting of a 3 sample soup (turtle soup, gumbo du jour, and chef's seasonal soup), the black skillet seared gulf fish and the creole bread pudding souffle. We also ordered the pecan-crusted gulf fish and a glass of von hovel white wine.Out of the soups, the gumbo du jour was our favorite. The pecan-crusted gulf fish was divine. The creamy crushed-corn sauce that came with it wonderfully complimented the crunchiness of the pecan crust. The seared gulf fish was also complimented by a great, spicy, smoked tomato vinaigrette sauce. The bread pudding souffle was the most unique. It was topped with a bourbon sauce that added an extra level of sophistication to this traditional dessert.After our meal, our waiter, Todd, was kind enough to give us a tour of the estate, a perfect way to cap a perfect meal. Thanks to him we learned about the history of the restaurant as well as the craftsmanship that went into making every one of its dining rooms feel like a different setting altogether. The garden room has floor-to-ceiling panes of glass that overlook the patio, while the main dining room downstairs has hand-carved wooden replicas of the native birds of Louisiana as well as electric chandeliers, each worth $10,000, with lights that flicker and move as if they were candle flames. Todd also gave us a tour of the red wine collection, and the cellar room that can host a private party surrounded by their extensive collection of wine bottles. One of the cellar rooms is kept locked at all times because the wine bottles in there are so old that they shouldn't be moved, and obviously expensive ($6000 / per bottle). We also got to see the adjacent garden, belonging to the house where Ella Brennan still resides, and which is tended to by a full-time gardener. Needless to say, the service was excellent. Todd really gave us a new appreciation for the restaurant and made us feel as if we were family.Another lovely detail about our meal was that all of the ingredients for the pecan-crusted gulf fish came within a 50-mile radius, while most of the ingredients that make up the dishes on the menu come within a 100-mile radius. The open kitchen, which guests are welcome to walk through, features a list of the local ingredients used in the meals. TIP: For an excellent briefing on commander's palace, ask for Todd as your waiter!

Well, the bartender ignored us. We stood at the bar for over 30 minutes trying to get the bartenders attention. There was a celebrity at the bar, a local horn player, and the bartender simply ignored us, and most everyone else as well, as all his attention was on the horn player's party. Finally we got a drink. Well, after an hour our drink was gone and we were still waiting (this is 45 minutes after our reservation). We had been touching in with the hostess , but I finally went and complained. They told me it would be a bit longer. After an hour and a half from our reservation time we were finally seated.

I first was introduced to Commander's Palace back in the mid 90's when I was fresh out of college. I remember being thoroughly impressed with the place and even though I had been back to New Orleans since then, I had never made it back there. So, this trip, I made it a point to eat there. I was bringing my significant other and I wanted this meal to be one he wouldn't forget. I have had bad luck in the past that every time I wanted to make a meal special, something would happen (bad food, bad service) where it would be ruined. I called the restaurant a few hours before our reservation to make sure that everything went smoothly. I wanted an experienced waiter but I was rushed off the phone by the woman on the other end as she was ensuring that everything would go without a hitch. Judging by her tone of voice and lack of concern...I immediately became worried. We arrived at 6:30pm and were ushered upstairs. We sat down and were forgotten about. It took quite a bit of time to even get our menus. I wanted to like my experience. I really did. I was excited to show my better half a wonderful restaurant that had stuck in my mind for 15 years. We love great food and so far, our experience in New Orleans had been great. Every meal we had was memorable. Every bite was infused with flavor. Unfortunately, our meal at Commander's Palace was not. The best part of our meal was the beginning. I ordered the soup 1-1-1. Turtle Soup, Gumbo and their soup of the day which was potato leek. All very good. As an appetizer, we ordered the Shrimp and Tasso Henican. It was good not great like the waiter had promised. I ordered a salad that had strawberries and walnuts...again...it was good but nothing to make me weak in the knees. As an entree, I ordered a shrimp and grits dish and it was pretty bland (nothing like NOLA's shrimp and grits...which, btw, is SO good). My bf ordered a pork chop dish which again was good, but didn't compare to the delicacies we had had the previous nights. For dessert, I had to order the Bananas Fosters. That was good...not too sweet...just right. The service is what's supposed to be impeccable at Commander's Palace and it really wasn't. Huge time lapses would go without us seeing our waiter (Hugo was his name), plates would sit in front of us after we were done eating for a long time, bread crumbs left on the table, silverware not being replaced...just not something you expect from a fine establishment with the kind of reputation they have earned over the years. Maybe we got unlucky but it sure put a damper on what was supposed to be the creme de la creme meal. We will go back to New Orleans, however, Commander's Palace will be left off of the \"must go to\" list.

I came on the recommendation of a friend and, of course, the amazing reviews of my fellow Yelp-ers.

I'm not one who often eats at the \"fancier\" establishments (I enjoy good food. My wallet on the other hand, not so much...) but here, you'll get your money's worth: the servers are incredibly knowledgeable, the service is executed with uniform precision, and the food is incredible. From the prix fixe menu, I ordered the gumbo du jour (cochon du lait, on the day that I went), the Hog Heaven platter (house made sausage, sticky pork belly & pork tenderloin on a rice pilaf) and the Creme Brulee (tempting as the bread pudding sounded, I'm just not a fan of bread pudding in general...) My boyfriend got the Commander Salad to start with the Filet Mignon as his entree. The gumbo was great, though I wish I'd opted for the salad as well. I don't know how that salad was made (it looked simple enough) but it was hands down one of the best salads I've ever had. The pork tenderloin that came with my entree was incredibly tender, and flavourful and the pork belly was nothing short of delicious. The house-made sausage was a touch on the spicy side, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. The only thing on my plate that I didn't especially enjoy was the rice pilaf underneath, which was beneficial insofar as it left me room for dessert.Their creme brulee is genius, and I don't know why more people haven't figured this one out: they used a shallow dish so that the custard wasn't overwhelming the dish. It was fabulous! The service was impeccable: our waitress was incredibly well versed on the menu and the wine, and the presentation for every dish was well-timed.

When I arrived our host asked for me and thanked me for the gracious way I had made my request and gave us the best seat in the room!The entire brunch was amazing. The waiting staff were superbly trained and very kind. When you order a cocktail they make it stiff. When you ask about anything on the menu they'll tell you their earnest opinion. They make you laugh. Come during the brunch and you'll hear a three piece swing band that take requests (and even Christmas song requests if it's during the season).Leave your moderation at home when you get here, you're going to want to devour everything you eat. It is in my opinion the best 5-star dining I've ever had.A few tips - a taxi ride if you're staying in the French Quarter is about $15. You can always take the St. Charles Street Car back since there is a stop two blocks from the restaurant. If you are doing the brunch, best to save room and skip any breakfast beforehand. You can always request your desert to go.

It's a chance to dress up a bit, jaunt over to the Garden district, and sit in a classic setting (absolutely reserve the Garden Room) dining to big food. Brunch is a 3-course affair - picking among the appetizers with Eggs Sardou (poached egg on top of artichoke heart, surrounded by creamed spinach) a favorite; a range of entrees, including their classic pecan-crusted fish in a pool of creamed corn - skip the beef entree; and desserts (including a fan favorite, the $3 extra bread pudding souffle - which really seems to be bread pudding in a ramekin, topped with a still gooey meringue). Commander's reminds me of the bygone days in NO, without completely falling into the wilted-salad, stained tuxedo trap of other, classic restaurants in the French Quarter. Cocktails are highly encourage, and their bloody mary is a hand-crafted affair, served with pickled okra and peppers, as well as a bit of pomp and circumstance. However, it's just as likely diners will be working on their second or third martini before the noon bell strikes. Every local will tell you this place is overrated - agreed - but if you had to pick one of this ilk, Commander's Palace would be it. Yes, it's a jazz brunch, with strolling musicians \u00a0- but chances are you'll only see them once, playing 2-3 songs, and then disappear to another room in this large restaurant.

To start off the place it is just impressive. The d\u00e9cor of the establishment sets up how your entire meal will be which is elegant. I also like how every table has a chair with arms denoting the head of the table, it's very subtle. When seated our server was very pleasant, he introduced himself and a few others that would be attending our table. \u00a0We started out with some drinks, they have .25 cent top shelf martinis for lunch. Which he asked what I like and made an excellent recommendation. \u00a0Also while he was about the floor tending to his other tables, other servers came by to see if we need anything or if we would like any refills on drinks. I have never been attended to this well in a restaurant. \u00a0When our entrees came out the server explained what everything was and the same with the desserts, one of them also gave me a tip to add some of the souffl\u00e9 sauce to my coffee for a great flavor. \u00a0All in all the service alone warranted a generous tip. As for the food, I started off with some of their turtle soup. \u00a0Being adventurous and having never tried turtle I decide it was my best option and it was fantastic. The soup had so much flavor it would be hard to convey with words. \u00a0And that you would need to try it for yourself should you ever find yourself here. \u00a0For my entr\u00e9e I ordered the rack of lamb, which was delicious.

When it came out I was \u00a0impressed by the presentation, when you get the whiskey cream sauce, the one thing I didn't know was that you had to let them know when you wanted them to stop ladling the sauce on top. Which didn't bother me but I did have a generous helping of the sauce on the souffl\u00e9. \u00a0Overall this was one of the best meal I can remember, and the next time im even remotely close to the area I will make sure I make a reservation.", "Date": "2010-10-18", "Author_Location": "Randolph, NJ"}, {"Author": "Adam S.", "ReviewID": "TJniTLjt1AvV7VXAhrMBHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing.

The attention to detail was there but not on point. The waiters do bring the meals at the same time, but my plates sat for a long time before being cleared when I was finished. I sat for over 5 minutes without water during dinner, and our waiter never came back within 2 minutes of dropping dinner to check on our entrees (obviously I was a server for many years!). Our wine suggestion was OK - he sold us a Cabernet Franc (generally a mixing grape and I was relectant but trusted him). It was kind of flat and didn't compliment any of our meals - more blah. My scallops dish was very salty. I like salt, but I couldn't even finish it. The scallops themselves were cooked perfectly.

The Commander's Palace is arguably New Orleans' single most famous restaurant. Each Sunday afternoon diners flock to the CP Jazz Brunch, slightly more affordable than a full dinner, to revel in hedonistic bliss. \u00a0CP hires several small, local jazz ensembles to float from table to table, from palatial dining hall to palatial dining hall, taking requests, playing to kill. \u00a0I was privy to a Dixieland performance by the Paul Simon Jazz Trio, composed of steel-guitar, coronet, standing bass, and southern-gentlemanly charm.New Orleans is known for its food and its music. After considering the typical options for Spring Break '09 - Cancun, Tijuana, Daytona etc...- I remembered that food and music are two of my favorite things in the entire world. Cancun? What was I thinking!? I booked airfare and a hotel in December, leaving three whole months to stew in anticipation. \u00a0During said months I researched music and food in New Orleans and made many bookmarks on my computer.My Aunt Monica, lovingly dubbed \"Mud\" in my infancy, was the first person to suggest CP, and volunteered to sponsor a brunch there. \u00a0(She belongs in the Aunt-Hall-of-Fame). \u00a0According to Aunt Mud CP is the place to visit while you are in New Orleans. Commander's Palace is the jewel in the crown of the Brennan Family's New Orleans restaurant dynasty. The progenitor of the Brenan Family, Owen Brennan, opened his first restaurant on Royal St. in 1946, and now his children, his siblings, and their children own and run more than ten successful restaurants nationwide.When I entered the CP lobby I was slightly disappointed. \u00a0There was no charming jazz band to serenade me as I had hoped. \u00a0There was no music playing at all. \u00a0As I was ushered past a line of servers, each of which was nearly too eager to greet me, I was surprised that the CP Jazz Brunch started in complete silence. \u00a0I consumed the most delicious brunch of my life, struggling to pace myself and savor the experience, all the while feeling that something was amiss. \u00a0Polite chatter, and the occasional delighted squeal, which erupted from my mouth, were the only sounds to be heard. \u00a0I finished my main course, crab stuffed quail, and contented myself with a dumb-show Jazz Brunch. At least I would experience the infamous bread pudding souffl\u00e9.One of a swarm of waiters, Jon, emerged from his hive, and placed my exquisite dessert in front of me. Jon punctured the meringue-like, eggy souffl\u00e9 top with a spoon (infinitely more satisfying than cracking the caramelized top of a cr\u00e8me-brule\u00e9) and blessed it with a generous helping of whiskey cream sauce.As if orchestrated in advance for maximal effect, the Jo Simon Jazz Trio wafted into the room at the moment my spoon was poised, quivering, next to my mouth. I felt it appropriate to consume the first delicious bite in time with the Trio's first sugary notes. \u00a0Ahh, Fidgety Feet. \u00a0In the midst of a relaxed strum Jo Simon smiled a saccharine smile, and glanced deep into my eyes. I was seated directly next to a window, and sunlight glinted off the coffee colored steel of Jo's steel guitar. The coronet player wailed away at the ceiling and bobbed back and forth, not more than four feet away from my table. The bald-headed, long-bearded standing bass player looked totally lost in the music. Where are you all from?D.C.!Mr. Simon nodded to the rhythm of the standing bass, still grinning. \u00a0Great Place. \u00a0Welcome to New Orleans!I am not ashamed to say that as I shoveled a heaping spoonful of souffl\u00e9 into my mouth a shiver ran down my back.The delight of the food was enhanced by the music, and vice versa; the one without the other would have been like Kirk without Spock, or more appalling yet, like Batman without Robin. Music and fine cuisine were joined in a perfect union that left me fat, and utterly happy by my last, precious bite.When the Jo Simon Jazz Trio had finished Fidgety Feet they glided to one of my neighboring tables. \u00a0The coronet player did a remarkable impression of Louis Armstrong as they worked through A Kiss to Build a Dream On. Raspy vocals emerging from the throat of an Italian mobster-looking coronetist elicited a chuckle from all tables in the dining room. \u00a0Tiger Rag, A You're Adorable, and Mack the Knife brought the trio further and further away from my table. Evidently, Jazz Brunch Patrons had a soft spot for Louis Armstrong (A Kiss to Build a Dream On, Mack the Knife) and the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (Fidgety Feet, Tiger Rag). I finished my delicious bread pudding souffl\u00e9. \u00a0As the music drifted into the next room I stood and made my way toward the door, passing tables and tables of smiling faces as I left.", "Date": "2009-05-01", "Author_Location": "Washington, DC"}, {"Author": "Mario P.", "ReviewID": "IRqpk851Iu38sZ38-4tI9w", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Indisputably one of the finest restaurants I have ever dined at.

Commanders palace is an exception. I make it a habit to eat at some of the best restaurants when it comes to business, family and close friends. This trip to CP included all three. The thing I hate the most is having to get \"dressed\". When I eat I like to be comfortable, just as I would be at home. Butt, to get in the door at CP you must be dressed. So I did. Let me tell you I'm so glad I did too. When I called to get dress confirmation I got a recorded statement explaining what the men must wear. I was taken aback when I heard what the Ladies must wear. The recording stated that Women must dress to \"compliment the men\" Wow! I loved that old southern charm! I was so excited.  Without going into too much boring detail I want to preface dinner with this short statement. Service was impeccable, decor was warm and everyone was knowledgable. Now, off to the good stuff. I had a trio of soups. Perfect for tasting. The turtle soup to my surprise was NOT the standout. The Gumbo was. It was by far the best NOLA has to offer. Loaded with all the goodies and a buttery, herby finish. Delish! For my appetizer I had the Blue crab in Crystal and The Duck Foi Gras on top of beignet. OH MY GOD. BETTER THAN SEX! Well....almost! It was served with a side of Cafe Du Monde's Chicory Cafe AuLait topped with a cream containing duck foi gras renderings. The idea is to sip then bite. Heaven, literally...in the food sense. The entrees all sounded good. There was something about eating a dish that has been left unchanged for over 100 years that really peaked my interest though. I knew this was a staple at CP and had to try it. It was simple: Pecan crusted trout. Sounds boring to any foodie like me but the nostalgia involved made up for such a simple dish, this alone provoked me to order it. It was so good that my words alone could never describe it. So simple, so perfectly prepared. Perfection. Classic cooking at it's best. \u00a0For dessert I tried three. The creole bread pudding, the strawberry shortcake and Bananas Foster. They were all great. The standout here was the Strawberry shortcake and the BF. The shortcake was made fresh to order, I have never had one like that before. The strawberries were fresh and sweet, the shortcake was a little warmer than room temp but not hot and the chantilly cream was perfectly sweetened. The CBP was certainly delish and the soufle on top was wonderfull. The whisky sauce was sweet, bourbony and not to thick. The BF was served tableside, again using fresh simple ingredients. Butter, Brown Sugar, Banana Liquor, Rum, Vanilla bean ice cream and Fresh bananas!! The server finished the sauce by using some of the ice cream to give it a smooth, rich and creamy finish. I knew he would do that. I would have and when he bagan I smiled. He recognized that I was truly into food and how much I appreciate good cooking. To top the night off he sent the Chef de cuisine to our table and we had a discussion about the food and dinner. I had to know where on Earth he got the inspiration for the Foi Gras Cafe aulait. He told me that he was at Cafe du Monde and was thinking about ways to pair dishes. He was sipping Chicory coffee and whalla! It came to him. Duck Foi Gras renderings in the cafe aulait.....really, REALLY........MAGIC.", "Date": "2010-05-07", "Author_Location": "Scottsdale, AZ"}, {"Author": "Yang C.", "ReviewID": "Hjcr4OIDnJMJNcerrbZh4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "4 stars???? Really 4 stars? No i'm not crazy. This place has been so highly recommended and so highly touted that we had to go. Actually went here for my birthday, I sure the heck didn't tell them it was my birthday but they knew anyways (more about this later).We were promptly greeted once we entered, escorted upstairs to a great table one table back from overlooking the courtyard, overall very happy where we were seated.Our waitress and her associate were super friendly and super genuine. You can definitely tell that they enjoy their jobs and it reflects well. We split their seasonal salad, I had to have the turtle soup, we also split the oyster in absinthe dome, dinner buddy had the Crawfish Maque Choux and I had the Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish. Everything was delicious, the oyster in absinthe dome was fantastic! I mean, really fantastic! The salad we split, don't remember the name but it was very good. The turtle soup..... a different story and why this place received 4 stars. Turtle soup was a bit salty, didn't send it back as I learned later on during my trip that they over salt most everything in NO, but the main issue I had was that I didn't taste the turtle aspect of the soup. It was a good base, I mean besides the saltiness, but there was nothing special to it. There was this expectation set, not only by reading the reviews online, but even by our waitress that stated that it was world famous. Sorry to say, it was nothing out of the ordinary to me. This isn't to say not for anyone to try it, its a must apparently when you go to Commander's, but I might just have to pass the next time I go.The Crawfish Maque Choux wasn't bad, but nothing mind blowing in regards to flavors, once again, a bit saltier than expected but then again it's just because we aren't familiar with the saltiness for the region.My pecan crusted fish did taste like crab as the waitress stated, very good. I was almost full from the previous courses but I was still very happy with the fish.Now on to the funny part (this did not dock them the star, the saltiness of the meal did, even though it's normal for the region, just not normal for me, a west coast boy, did) Anyhow, if it's your birthday there, they tie some balloons to a chair at your table. They also come over and say happy birthday, very tastefully. But for the life of me I couldn't figure out how they heck they knew. I kept wondering to myself if I was vain enough to put down its my birthday on my reservation, but I try to avoid acknowledgment of my birthday at all costs, so I was pretty sure it wasn't me. I thought it might have been one of my friend's who called in and such, and would take care of the bill also, but they presented us with the bill and my dinner guest paid. When I came back to work, my friend asked me how it went and told me she had called and told them it was my birthday and that she told them to charge her CC, they skipped the last part but the gesture was very nice by my friend and Commander's dropped the ball on this, but it was perfectly fine as it wasn't expected at all)Strawberry shortcake is just the right touch to complete the mealWould I go back? Most definitely as the atmosphere and setting of this place is just terrific. I would and will highly recommend for anyone visiting NO to pay this great establishment a visit.

We were celebrating two birthdays and they brought out chef hats for us when they brought us our desserts. It was a great prop for pictures! The best part of our lunch were the 25 cent martinis!!!!Service was fantastic. I had called ahead of time to inquire about the dress code since we had just flown in that morning and they encouraged dressy attire but only required that people not wear shorts. Regardless, the hostess gave me the stinkeye for coming in jeans and a top. Aside from that, our drinks were always promptly refilled and it was almost funny how each table is surrounded by servers when the food is all brought out at the same time. The only complaint I have about service is that it is a bit slow.

I mean, both Emeril Lagasse and John Besh started their careers here. We went for dinner. It's reservations only. I dressed in a silk summer dress with flats, but it's not super casual nor upscale. We took a taxi and were greeted by the valet. As soon as we walked in, the Maitre D sat us at our table. He got a little confused and walked us in through the kitchen, which was a nice and interesting detour for a foodie :). The decor is a lovely balance of modern (similar to a cornflower blue walls) and classic (crystal chandeliers). Oh except for the random fake birds and their birdhouses on the walls. I mean, at least I didn't feel as if they were going to start flying around, but it was a little bit scary for someone who is ornithophobic (like me). The lighting was a little on the dark side, but I'd rather that than so bright it triggers a migraine.Our waiter was very friendly, patient, and always willing to answer my questions. He loved that we were from California. Most meals in New Orleans start with a drink, so I had 2: a Holly Berry Martini and a Petite Saint. The Holly Berry Martini was originally a seasonal drink (Christmas time) but it became so popular they kept it year round. Both were very good and started the meal off right. I had the Turtle Soup as an appetizer. It's made with real turtles (I had to ask). It was a bit salty for my taste and kind of reminded me of a Chinese Hot and Sour soup. Still, it's what they are known for so I had to try it.For my entree I had the Cracklin Crusted Pork Tenderloin. I pretty much obliterated it...TRUST. It was a pork tenderloin with foie gras and black cherry injected with foie gras boudin, drunken cherries, butter braised leeks, and sweet onion soubise. The meat was moist. The crust gave it a texture which allowed me to eat the entire thing without getting bored of it. It was good.For dessert I had the Creole Bread Pudding Souffle. Sadly they ran out of the Creme Brulee which was disappointing because I had been craving it, but the souffle wasn't a bad second. We were served coffee along with it which helped end the meal on a warm note. Our waiter was awesome and even had the chef write salutations on my dessert plate in honor of me passing my board exams!

(well, \"durh\" you might say, whaddya expect with meringue and bread pudding???). \u00a0Halfway in I was so stuffed that I couldn't finish it.At about $80-90 each (including drinks) for three of us, our experience was very disappointing. \u00a0I've had way better meals for less at other restaurants. \u00a0I had read some reviews on here about how Commander's is a lot of hype, and in retrospect, I can see now how that's true. \u00a0Call me crazy, simple-minded, whatever you like... but I'd much rather have a baked ham sandwich at Mother's than what I had at Commander's. \u00a0The service was awesome, the ambiance was excellent, the drinks were some of the best, but the food... how could you serve such bland food???", "Date": "2012-02-23", "Author_Location": "Denver, CO"}, {"Author": "Thomas K.", "ReviewID": "fm_t3kVvecAhSA8pKLcITA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Food is great, ask for the soup sampler so you can try all 3.", "Date": "2012-11-04", "Author_Location": "Granby, CT"}, {"Author": "S R.", "ReviewID": "X-OR390SS-OQzVsLHYc1Rw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great service and good food", "Date": "2013-01-03", "Author_Location": "New Orleans, LA"}, {"Author": "Philip P.", "ReviewID": "m1FeJGGaabGYreImmoOIbA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Dined there tonight 6/1/2013. food was excellent.

The boyfriend's gumbo was fabulous. \u00a0I only tried the sauce, as it was filled with seafood and I didn't want to get sick on the trip. \u00a0The lamb was perfectly cooked...the fish, I didn't try. \u00a0The cheesecake? Good. \u00a0Anywhere else it would probably be great, but here it was just good. \u00a0Why? Because the bread pudding completely rocked my world!I have never had bread pudding before. Never. It sounds so bland and unappetizing to me. \u00a0But Commander's is also known for its bread pudding, so I figured I had to try it too. \u00a0I am a convert...well, a Commander's bread pudding convert! \u00a0This was fabulous. \u00a0I went on this trip in January and still think about this bread pudding. \u00a0I've since found the recipe and will be making it many times in my life...I'm just looking for the right bread, and I think I may have found it! \u00a0It was so amazing and I was so glad that I ordered it instead of the boyfriend because I was able to say \"I win!\" \u00a0(We have this game where we compete to see who orders the better meal at restaurants.)If you can order anything from Commander's just order the bread pudding. \u00a0I know they do 25 cent \u00a0martinis, but skip it. \u00a0The bread pudding is worth the additional $8.25 you'd be paying and you will get a more satisfaction than any martini you could ever drink.", "Date": "2009-09-25", "Author_Location": "San Francisco, CA"}, {"Author": "Neli S.", "ReviewID": "1jV-mkk6SrPHJ_04qsRqdA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were there for a Saturday brunch, and loved it!!

Esp something that 600+ ppl haven't already mentioned?? Hands-down the best. Perfect to even the timing that the servers place ur plate on the table. It will forever be the restaurant that I compare all restaurants to & so far it can't be beat. Ask to see the kitchen or get a tour & they'll take you right through. Why? Because they pride themselves on making their guests feel welcomed & they truly mean it. I've had several things on the menu & they were all amazingly good. I have not been disappointed by a single entree or appetizer. The bread pudding here is the absolute best I've had- but different bc they put their own spin on things & turn it into a light souffle. SO good. Everything I've had on their menu (even the standard- & usually bleh- pecan pie looks as good as it tastes! I've been here many many times (as much as my wallet can afford me) & have never been disappointed with anything. Except! The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. One minor blemish in otherwise perfection every time. I'm picky about my creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The top has to be perfectly carmelized & crunchy & the creme must be smooth & flavorful. Commander's creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was none of these things bc I think they torched it & then put it in the fridge. Big no no... Makes the top all soft. A mistake that I'm surprise that commanders made bc they usually make no mistakes. In any case, if u are in the area, shame on you if you don't come here. There's a reason y this is the best restaurant in the US. Hands down.

Whether you're rocking in your chair on an oversized porch, taking in the sounds of the mockingbirds and the warm sun, or sitting in Commanders palace over endearing southern accents, charm, and live jazz.I was recommended to dine here by the owner of a local B&B. \u00a0After reading the menu online and seeing that they have a weekend jazz brunch, I thought it'd be an excellent choice to take my sister for her birthday. \u00a0On their website, it says brunch is served for only 1/2-2 hrs on the weekend, so I was curious as to if people seated during the last half hour would get a chance to listen to music. \u00a0I called to ask before deciding on a time. \u00a0I was told the band continues to play for about 1 hour after the last seating. \u00a0I hastily made a reservation a week in advance for a Sunday afternoon. \u00a0Knowing that southerners tend to be punctual, we arrived on time. \u00a0There was a doorman and a host there to greet us, but we were told to wait about 10 minutes and we're escorted through the kitchen to the bar. \u00a0At the bar you can get a clear view of this kitchen, which I enjoyed. \u00a0I ordered a champagne rose, my sister a mimosa, and my grandmother a whiskey smash which was made just right with muddled mint, lemon, and Maker's Mark Bourbon. \u00a0We sat out on the patio as we waited, as it was a lovely day. \u00a0About 20 minutes later from when we arrived we were seated to the dining room adjacent to the patio. \u00a0Comfortable seats and white tablecloths with 3 festive balloons in the center of our table. \u00a0Balloons may sound tacky, but along with the jazz music I found the decor to be charming in a space that is bright and sunny; with a lovely, small, center room garden.We were greeted by a server (I think his name was Peter) whom noted the specials, explained the menu, and patiently answered any questions we had. \u00a0I mentioned it was my sister's birthday, and another server came to tie balloons to her seat. \u00a0As we were deciding on which dishes we'd like in our 3 course, we were brought french garlic bread and offered a beverage. \u00a0My Bellini was very good as was the bread, nothing special to the garlic bread but it tasted fresh.I decided to start with the Shrimp and Tasso Henican - Wild Louisiana white shrimp stuffed with spicy Cajun ham, Crystal hot sauce beurre blanc, pickled okra and five pepper jelly. \u00a0The thought of this dish makes me gasp. \u00a0This dish alone would bring me back to Commanders Palace, it was that good. \u00a0Something you just had to savor in your mouth. \u00a0My sister had the soup on special and my grandmother had a salad on special, both of which were very good.As an entree, I enjoyed the Pecan Crusted Gulf Fish - Champagne poached jumbo lump crab, spiced pecans and crushed corn sauce.I've always thought that fish should be enjoyed without having to be accompanied by another marine animal, such as crab. \u00a0But I've never \u00a0been opposed the idea, and I wanted to see if maybe my assumption was wrong. \u00a0What I assumed would be too rich and creamy ended up being light and fluffy, with no overbearing flavors. \u00a0It was a delicate dish served warm that offered you how you wanted to savor the robust, well combined flavors. The fresh, french bread was also served midmeal, to swipe into anything left on your plate. \u00a0I'm not a big fan of pecans, or pecan pie. \u00a0But I'm in NOLA, where they're famous for all things culinary, and pecan pie is one of them. \u00a0I'm all about immersing myself in a place, doing as the locals would do, eating as they would. \u00a0I found the slice of pie exceedingly large and very sweet and crunchy. \u00a0A little too sweet for my taste. \u00a0The crust of the pie and the vanilla ice cream that accompanied it was more enjoyable, paired with a cup of fresh chicory coffee \u00a0I did tast my sister's Creole Bread Pudding Souffle. \u00a0Hot, gooey down goodness inside served in a puffed pastry. \u00a0What tasted to me of vanilla extract and bourbon stood out. \u00a0My grandmother had a vanilla ice cream special which was very, very good but unfortunately, I do not remember the details in which the dish was.The service and food were above standards. \u00a0Table crumbs removed and fresh silverware inbetween meals. \u00a0I had learned on a garden district tour I had taken the previous day that the owners do not leave the restaurant up to their managers, and that they're on the premises everyday. \u00a0And there we could see as were dining, a man in a suit checking on dishes and the service. \u00a0Everything was served in a relaxed, timely manner, we arrived at 1 and didn't leave until 3:30.I only wish that they had a jazz band in each dining room. \u00a0It was more-so a rotating jazz music, so we only got to listen to about 20 minutes of jazz during our stay. \u00a0The band was very good and I would have enjoyed more. \u00a0They took requests and played tableside which was nice.A fantastic value as well, for 4 - 3 crse. entrees, 4 coffees and 2 drinks, our bill came to $60 pp. For a truly creole affair, CP lives up to the standard.", "Date": "2010-03-13", "Author_Location": "Philadelphia, PA"}, {"Author": "Kristina M.", "ReviewID": "W6rnjJ2KPvKBZ3h2AsvzGQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wonderful experience. \u00a0I am glad I was able to go to this restaurant on my trip to New Orleans. \u00a0Great serves and good presentation. \u00a0Prices are resonable. \u00a0I wans't a big fan of the jumbo but the rest of the food was terrific.", "Date": "2010-06-26", "Author_Location": "Annapolis, MD"}, {"Author": "Utsav R.", "ReviewID": "tmXH5TlnCTO2kSDVGMYAIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unbelievably good!

The new husband and I took the St. Charles line out to the Garden District and upon walking Lafayette Cemetery and the neighborhood, we landed here one of the best meals in New Orleans.We were greeted with enthusiasm and genuine Southern Hospitality. Seated by the hostess, then introduced us to the team of servers led by a Captain - that was a sign that we were in for amazing service. Led by Steve, the group of servers were hands on for our needs, and very charismatic in telling us the history of the restaurant.We started with amazing garlic toast, the flavor was crisp and delicious, hubby and I put butter on everything, but truth be told this toast was yummy on it's own. The butter was left untouched. The husband decided upon the soup du jour, which was a Chicken and Bean soup in true Southern style - thick yet mellow in taste, the beans were not overpowering and the chicken was not diced but rather shredded, it made a good opener. I went with a Pris Fix, and started with a Romaine salad with a creamy pepper dressing - I have never had anything like it ever! I love pepper and this dressing was not overdone or over oily. Perfectly creamy with kicks of peppercorn in each bite of evenly mixed bacon and pressed eggs. Hubby followed with the Fillet Mignon in a mushroom reduction over the fluffiest mashed potatoes we have ever known. The fillet was tender and moist, the reduction complimented the protein without taking away any flavor and the potatoes melted in your mouth with every bite. It was buttery and so light, the hubby went as far as to say the potato was ever better then the fillet! I had the Commander's Grille which gave me three treats on a plate - a spicy Cajun chicken sausage, a veal medallion injected with bacon marinade which made the veal very tender, and a beef medallion. All three proteins came on a bed of andoullie stuffing and some fried greens. I couldn't decide what I wanted, but this dish was a right mix of everything I wanted. Each meat was prepared well, I asked for medium - I got medium on the veal and beef but bot cuts retained a moistness and soft tenderness. My fig reduction was a little under seasoned, but the stuffing well makes up for it. We finished with the molten lava chocolate cake - chocolate cakes it was decadent but now I wished I tried their bread souffle.It seems the menu on-line is different from the in house menu we were offered, so it really pays to visit the place. During the course of our meal, our water glasses were replaced with new ones with additional ice. There was little waiting time between dishes and the whole meal came and went without fuss - truly well choreographed. The house \"mother\" came by and ensured we were having a great time, and the staffed congratulated us on our recent nuptials. The Commander's Palace is everything I could imagine for a classic New Orlean's Garden District institution. The staff cares for your experience with them, and the little things matter to them. I wish I took pictures of my dishes, but the hubby said it wasn't classy. He was right, Commander's Palace is one of those rare classy places to take a step back in time and enjoy new modern dishes.* A meal for two with starters, entrees and a dessert - $100.

As far as service, they excelled as per their reputation. Honestly, a little too cordial for me, this place would be ideal to impress a date, or if you are older and feel like making it an \"experience\". While it is \"nice\" inside, the style was not for me,On to the food. I had Turtle soup which I have loved for a long time but there is not a lot of access to it in many areas. The turtle soup here was good, and to be fair, I could have eaten much more than the tiny bowl had for me, but there was something a tad off. I can't put my finger on it, but there was a flavor I neither liked or completely hated in theirs that I would have not preferred.For entree I picked Duck Confit, which again, despite being a small portion, I was very pleased with. The beans were tender and had just enough flavor, and the small duck leg was exactly what I would expect.My BIG complaint was the dessert. Being a brunch, and simply in general, I don't order dessert. I'm mildly allergic to dairy, so in short I pretty much never get dessert. When the server took my order, after I had told him my entree, he asked \"and are you having the * or * with that\". The wording of which led me to believe the dessert CAME with that entree. He did not ask \"do you want desert?\" or \"would you like dessert with that?\" So I ordered the strawberry shortcake WITHOUT whip cream. When I received my bill, I had paid an extra $9 for a small buttermilk biscuit with a few strawberries cut up around it. A few other people in my large group had also fallen for the ploy.If it had not been for that, I would have been pleased overall, but that really upset me. It could be said I could have asked if that would be extra, but when put in a \"formal\" setting such as that, I don't feel I should be asking a question like that. The menu \"specials\" at the top is an example of the confusion induced during ordering.Also of note is many people in my group ordered the \"Shrimp and Grits\" and loved it. Overall, I can't say I regret going here, but that tactic will stick with me.

Mandina's is the best turtle soup I had had up to this point, and I'd say this was just a tad better. Me, my boyfriend and his mother all decided to get the pecan crusted gulf fish (I forget what the fish of the day was) and all adored it. His dad got the filet (I refuse to eat beef from anywhere besides Charlie's, after many attempts at wonderful restaurants around the city all left me disappointed). He wasn't able to get any sauce on it because of diet restrictions. I thought this was very unfortunate, but he didn't want to make an exception for the third time on his trip to NOLA.

The waiter, while sincerely kind, once he finished RAVING about the cuchon de lait (& I told him while it sounded so rich, that I was a vegetarian) looked at me like \"Well what the hell are you doing here then?\" (with complete kindness of course!) and suggested the pancakes.

The Griddle Seared Gulf Fish was perfectly \"griddled\" and the fish was nicely cooked, but the dish itself was way over-salted.

I had the cheesecake which was delicious and my husband had the bread pudding souffle. One word yummy! The reputation of this Establishment is well dis served. Service,food and atmosphere(including a jazz traveling trio who took requests) were incredible. We were glad this was the last stop on our trip because everything else would have paled in comparison.
