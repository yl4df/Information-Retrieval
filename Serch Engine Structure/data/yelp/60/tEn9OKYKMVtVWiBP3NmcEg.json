Unbelievably awesome, you definitely need to share this, maybe with more than two people.Tried the veggie burger for my entr\u00e9e, again made the mistake to ask the waiter his recommendation between fries and the potato salad (geez, dude chill out when someone asks you for your opinion).

I've been a number of times and am finally getting around to putting my happiness into a review to share. \u00a0I've gone on dates, with a group of friends, with just one friend and I'd feel completely comfortable going alone and sitting at the bar. It's one of those places I feel is great for just about any occasion. When the food is good, man it's amazing. But some things are best passed over. The beer is reliably good and you can be guaranteed a chill experience which is what I expect at my brewpubs.Service is always friendly and prompt without issue. It can get insanely busy on the weekend nights though. Shocking for a Logan Square joint that serves liquor, I know.A sampling of items I've had at Revolution over my visits:Bacon Fat Popcorn $5 - Am I a jerk if I say this is overhyped? Yea, probably. It's got a little cheese & bacon on top of popcorn but I really didn't think this was anything all that special. However, if you just need something small to munch on and share with someone over some beers, it's a good option. Eugene Cake $7 - Yep, you guessed it. It's made with Eugene Porter. Well the ice cream is. It's an indulgent dessert and goes best with...Eugene Porter, duh!Bowl of soup $6Sweet Potato cakes $7 - I'll take a pass on having this dish again. Sounded really cool in theory but just wasn't as amazing as I hoped it would be.Scotch Egg $9 - One of the more pricey scotch eggs but it's darn good! Herb-malt vinegar whip, frisee, champagne vinaigrette....goodness gracious, full of succulent flavor. The price point is just a tad too high on this though.Gratin $9 - I believe they took this off the menu and I don't mind. It wasn't a dish I was a big fan of, not enough flavor.Various pints of brews, too numerous to name usually for $5-9 with most being $6. They also have sampler sizes of all their beers for $2 with a few extra special beers for $3. I love getting a few of those to try some I haven't before...or if I just feel like mixing it up a bit. Revolution is one of those breweries that every beer I've tried has been solid. I can only name about three breweries like that. My favorite I've ever had was Chicago Smoke and I'm just crossing my fingers they bring it back. I've been craving it but it's nowhere on their brew schedule. :( Other top brews of theirs to me are the 4th Year Beer and A Little Crazy.

The upstairs room is gorgeous and it was perfect to fit our 100 person wedding ceremony and reception. From the beginning they were so easy to work with. Meghan Rutledge was an exceptional coordinator. She had an answer to every one of my questions and was so easy to get ahold of. They also let us change around their party menu so we could have cheeseburgers and fries for the main entree. Everyone at the reception kept saying how wonderful the food was and that it was one of the best burgers they ever had. The staff at Revolution, especially Stephanie our day of coordinator, were amazing. They were very conscious of whether or not my husband and I were eating. They even put our burgers away until we were done thanking all the tables so our food would not be cold. They also made sure we had a beer in our hand at all times.

I don't know how they make those beer onions, but I'm committed to finding out. The blue cheese potato salad on the side is perfection.

The space is lovely, the staff was more than welcoming and friendly and the space itself is gorgeous. \u00a0I really love the decor of the place. \u00a0The wood from barrels are used on the walls, the metal strapping is used for the light fixtures. \u00a0This place is all beer. \u00a0Not to mention, the location has it right off the blue line. \u00a0So, you there is no need to take a taxi and no excuse for not having that extra beer for the road! I think we arrived last night at 9 pm and spent the next 5 hours drinking and talking. \u00a0I want to say i had 7 beers but, that can't be correct.. With the majority of my choices weighing in around 8 percent alcohol, I should feel much worse than I do. \u00a0 Not to mention i got in around 3 and was at a 730 meeting this morning. \u00a0 I digress. Now here are my issues with this place and why i can't give this place 5 stars. \u00a0Part of the reason is because of the food we ordered. \u00a0We started with the cheese plate and the charcuterie plate.. Both of these were 15 dollars a piece. \u00a0The cheese plate came with 3 different types of cheese, macrona almonds and a bunch of flat bread. \u00a0The cheese while a nice selection of Midwest Cheddar and Gouda was really sparse. \u00a0LIke three very thin and small tastes of each of the three styles.. It was perhaps a slice large enough to fit on a ritz cracker. \u00a0And perhaps an 8 th of an inch thin. \u00a0This is Chicago, \u00a0I expect a lot more cheese than that. \u00a0 \u00a0So, i found that while the cheese selection was nice, the portion was paltry. \u00a0 The charcuterie plate while not cured meats, there was one sort of rillette, one pork terrine and two sausages. these were really nice. \u00a0I then moved on a couple of hours later to splitting a pizza with someone. \u00a0it was a shrimp pizza. \u00a0They have a pretty oven but, it was just ok. \u00a0The toppings were cold while the pizza was warm. \u00a0They must have topped the pizza after it came from the oven. \u00a0it was not exciting. \u00a0My buddy got a pork belly and egg sandwich i believe and he was disappointed. \u00a0So, the food is not too exciting though the menu reads really nicely. \u00a0My last sort of complaint well, not complaint was there bottle options.. it's strange and I guess a service for them to be offering other beers but, their prices are ridiculous. \u00a0They are selling beers I have paid 8 bucks a bottle for, for 29 dollars.. i get it, they are basically saying, yeh, you can drink other people's beer at our place but, we are basically going to rip you a new one.. But, then they also had a 3 floyds ipa for 6 bucks so, I would say \" navigate with caution\"But my few minor criticisms aside, go here, support them and their awesome beer. \u00a0Spend some time, drink you way through their list and when you think you have had just about enough, have one more. \u00a0Great beer, really nice people, life is good.", "Date": "2013-07-09", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Randy D.", "ReviewID": "eSmQigmO2sH0gxWFYoGuvw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only reason this isn't a 5 star is the service - and it's not THAT bad, it's just that the restaurant is often very loud, crowded and as a result, seemingly understaffed.

Um, as a marketing person, I would suggest caving and calling it what it is - a beer flight. My beer buddy and I ordered two beer flights (four for each) allowing us to sample eight beers. I would suggest going this route - it gives you a good feel for the range of beers. I also want to give a shout out to whoever writes their beer descriptions - brilliant writing!The food is fairly typical pub food, with a touch of flair. Meaning it's pretty good pub food. I had the wings and others at my table tried a pizza, fish and chips, and burger and fries. All looked pretty good. The building is super cool and stylish and huge!

Our wait time was 45 minutes, but that doesn't matter when you have beer awaiting you at the bar.The one thing I don't like about this place is that the bar is in the middle of the restaurant. It does stand as a focal point, but makes it difficult and awkward to stand and drink a beer because you're standing either near the entrance, behind people sitting at tables eating meals, or in the walkway area next to the wall where everyone is passing by. Luckily, two seats at the bar freed up and we were able to sit and enjoy a beer while waiting for a table.I started out with the Anit-hero IPA, which I've had once before. It is incredibly drinkable and not at all overly-hoppy, but maybe I've just become so accustomed to drinking IPAs now? My bf had Rise, a heavy stout that is smooth in flavor. Finally our table was ready and it's mealtime.I had the Workingman burger, which comes with cheddar, bacon (duh), and beer onions. I'm not usually someone who likes onions, but they were actually a nice addition to the burger. They were caramelized and had hints of beer in it. My burger came with a side of fries that were absolutely divine. Hand-cut fries will always win my heart. My bf had the Smokehouse burger which comes with peper jack cheese and pulled pork. Now that's a burger. They were a little pricey ($11, $13) but they were good, so I can't complain too much.Okay, back to the beer. Bf had the Winter Saison that was good, but tasted like it was high on alchol content. I mean they're all up there, but this one just TASTED like it. I had the Coup D'Etat, also a saison, but a French style. This one was actually higher in alcohol than the winter, but tasted better and was more drinkable. He also had the Iron Fist which has four different hops in it (delish) and a sampling of the Berry Brown. Gross. This one was gross. It was overwhelmingly fruity, and had a brown aftertaste, if that makes sense. I had one sip and said \"good luck\" as he tried to finish it. It's like 9% ABV and it tasted like it.There are some beers that they ran out of, so I would love to come back and try some more. Overall, Revolution is cool.

We in fact chose the Smoke Stack pizza which had a fun and perfectly portioned array of sausage, bacon and pulled pork. The crust, the meat, the cheese; everything was perfect. We shared the pizza and a Reuben sandwich which was fresh and tasty. Cheddar and garlic mash on the side was a perfect comfort food accompaniment.I asked the waiter to choose six small servings of different beers, and he was happy to oblige.

She was a sassy, attentive, and honestly the best waitress I've ever had. I wanted to give her more business. I wanted to buy her a beer. I wanted to be her friend. Then I realize that those thoughts are slightly creepy, so I just gave her a big tip instead.Food: This was actually kind of a let down for me. I got the chicken and waffles, which I guess is a popular dish for them. The chicken was nice and crispy, the waffle golden and fluffy, the salsa nicely tangy, but it just seemed like there was something missing. The salsa wasn't saucy enough and had a lot of string onions to pick through. My dish was decent, but not the best. Luckily, I went with a group of friends that night and had plenty of friend-dishes to sample from. A particular favorite was the Smoke Stack - pulled pork, Italian sausage, bacon, pepp, and smoked tomato. There were six splitting the pizza as an appetizer and trust me, it was hard to share.However, the winner of the day was definitely the Flemish BeefStew.

I was worried the strong funk of blue cheese would overpower, but it's subtle, well-balanced. The Iron Fist fish and chips, too, are good. The fish more than the chips.

So, of course, I paired that with the bleu cheese mussels. Hopleaf is my standard of brew-house mussels and I think these compare. Cheese and shellfish might sound horrible - at first.

It warmed me up in many ways. It's also very filling, so keep that in mind. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and was surprised with how big it was (...thatshwatshesaid. I can't help myself). Topped with mustard and slaw and served on an insanely big bun, the pork is nicely seasoned and heaped onto the plate. I had to set it down and take heaving breaths while eating it (this is a good thing). I ate the entire sandwich but only got through half of my bleu cheese potato salad side.

Something that can make the craft beer experience even better is a great pairing it with thoughtful inventive food- something Revolution clearly understands with their astoundingly expansive menu, complete with plenty of options for a veggie like myself or a meat lover like my former self. On one particular visit to the Rev I got down on a seriously tasty Chicago Style Tofu (dog). Whoa, Mama- things got a little dirty (as in messy, not filthy) to say the least. The overflowing and copious amounts of neon relish, yellow mustard, sport peppers, tomatoe, onion, celery salt, and grilled tofu slab on a poppy seed hotdog bun (also topped with a very noteworthy crunchy pickle slice) made my maw gape.

I hit up this new, hip Logan Square hot spot (that's becoming a pattern, ain't it?) on one of our balmy Summer-esque nights recently and let me tell ya, it was the perfect place to be! Huge windows opened to the street, glorious draft beer flowing like a river, tasty bites passing excitedly chatty lips... truly, the epitome of an ideal city night. Taking a cue from the popularity of our local brewery/pubs, Revolution has turned up the heat on the formula of microbrew + gastrofare + social gathering spot and left its competitors way, way, way back in the dust. Granted, some of their bites could use thoughtful tweaking, but the beer is spot on. My short list of things to love (and things to avoid) at RBC... LOVE: 1. Beer. A doi. The orange wheat Belgian 'Bottom Up Wit' with hints of spice and coriander downright rocks as does the uberhoppy 'Iron Fist Pale Ale' and, my fav, the amazingly smooth and lovely 'Coup D' Etat' French saison. Mais Oui! 2. Pizza. House-fired in a beautiful brick oven, these are an undeniably melty, gooey, crispy, perfect accompaniment to your drinks. After all, what on Earth goes better with beer than pizza? 3. Sandwiches. Especially the meaty, spicy, HUGE, Smoked Pulled Pork sammie on a huge brioche bun and accompanied by honey-jalapeno slaw and your choice of three infallible sides (psst, go for the garlic cream cheese mashed). AVOID: 1. House-made Sausage & Ham Plate. As an app, fell a bit short. Super heavy on the bread and less so on the meat. While the Jagerwurst and Schinkenspeck Ham rocked, the Thuringer tasted like baloney and the portions at $14 seemed better substituted by the Sweet Potato Cakes and PEI Mussels getting all the rave reviews. 2. Hampshire-Duroc Pork Chop. Presented absolutely beautifully yet contained a major flaw in the sage stuffing side which was completely burnt on the bottom and pork which was slightly dry. Le Sad. Overall more good than bad... lesson learned, I should have stuck to the beer bones and items that more so go with beer over fancy pants pork chops.

The good news for us is that we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.I was prepared for bad acoustics as a few friends mentioned it was excessively loud. I say-- not so much at all! Our party of four was able to hold easy conversation without straining to talk or hear.We started with a few appetizers-- the bacon fat popcorn (tasty with TONS of thick bacon) and the steamed mussels. They offer two versions of the mussels: the classic style prepared with white ale, celery, shallot, and bay leaf; and the other prepared with hard cider, blue cheese, leeks and Fuji apple. Usually I'd go with v.1 as I order something similar at Hopleaf and admittedly, I get a bit skeeved out about cheese and seafood together. However, I really enjoyed their fresh take on this dish and if I was sitting closer, would've probably ate more than just a few. Boom!For my main, I ordered one of the evening's specials which was a pork belly sandwich. It was served on some type of soft multi-grain bread which I felt was an incorrect pairing. The pork belly is so rich and fatty and could have used more substantial armor. Though good, the threat of falling apart was always a possibility. Even better than the sandwich was the side I choose-- the cream cheese garlic mashed potatoes. So outrageously delicious that I could probably eat an entire wheelbarrow full of 'em. And after this meal, I could have been wheeled out in one, too!For dessert... they have a chocolate bread pudding that tempted but my beer had already filled the last of my stomach real estate.

Burgers and pizza and sweet potato cakes, oh my! I bended. I caved and said yes. On my way there at about 3:55pm, my friend's called saying that they were there and had been seated and were waiting my arrival. Sweet. I found my party after finding some easy parking, (after forking over a foot and a leg for the lovely LAZ parking), and sauntered in, looking about... nice. Woodsy decor, over there the large vats of beer being brewed. Over there, oh hey look at that plate. That looks good. Damn that is a big burger. Oh there is my table, appetizers? A few plates of them? Super sweet. We got the very tasty sweet potato cakes with a red pepper sauce. You get about five or so, luckily I had friends so I had to share, other wise these great little crispy critters would all be in my belly. Then on to the bruscetta. They have four different choices. Oh and you can get to choose which of the four you want. (Wait for it...) Or you get to mix and match. Love it. I also love the roasted cauliflower with the mashed chickpeas, (hummus to you and I), with lemon oil, but what really stole the order was the duck with mushrooms and fontina cheese. These crispy yet super flavorful piece of bread were great. The cheddar soup that my friends ordered were awesome as well, however I am glad I didn't get it. As flavorful as it was, a bowl of it's cheesy richness would have filled me up too much for my main course. Pulled. Pork. Hell yes. When you are starving and needing a large plate of tasty tasty pulled pork shoveled on to a massive, (and tasty and made on site), bun, so huge that you need to eat some of the pork before you could even fathom taking a bite of it as a sandwich, this would be a good place to start. The portion sizes are huge and I feel well worth what you pay. My friend's beef stew was more like \"two pounds of beef cooked in this great sauce\", (so quoted my friend), yet he some how managed to finish it off. The cream cheese garlic mashed potatoes were made by angels or the devil, I can't decide if they are sinful or heavenly, but no matter what damn good. The fish and chips were good too, but really at this point my eyes started to roll back in my head. Oh wait. Did I forget? Shoot. I must have. We are all gluttons and love to torture ourselves. So. Of course we got dessert. The special of the chocolate cake with some vanilla whiskey sauce was my favorite, (um.. hello? Chocolate?) Certainly you could taste the whiskey and it delivered a punch. I will say as good as it was, the presentation could have been done a little bit better. It basically looked like a brownie swimming in a vat of spiked milk. Perhaps making the sauce in to more of a thicker reduction would be a better option, if it could be done. The cherry bourbon cake dessert was good too. Our servers and really everyone was great to us. The space is lovely although feels a little crowded, almost people stacked on top of people. You aren't, you certainly have your space, but it just feels like it. By the time we got our check, there was an hour wait being quoted.

We are neighbors, after all.I called at 7 and the guy told me it was a 3 hour wait. 3 HOURS?! So I went accross the street and put our name in, hoping for a better time. The hostess told me 2 hours. We ran a little longer at work, and then called over there at 8:20 and they told us they just called our name. How perfect! So we were finishing working while 100 others were waiting. Nice :) \u00a0After being seated I ordered the iron Fist Pale Ale. Its an American Pale Ale, and pretty damn tasty. I had a second, I couldn't even bring myself to order something else because the Iron Fist was that good.For dinner I had the tofu sandwich. Best ever? No. But the fries were amazing, and the blue-cheese potato salad too. I also tried the Sweet Potato Cakes, which are seasoned with curry. Those were pretty amazing. As was the cheddar ale soup. All in all, everyone in my party loved what they got. The atmosphere was nice. Crowded but not horrible, nice ambient chatter, punk rock in the background, and great lighting. The space is huge, and well decorated. The menu looks great, I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the things I lusted over.

Such a steal, I can't even say Hipsters drink overpriced beers just for the fun of it. Foods:Bacon Fat Popcorn- Bacon, crispy sage & shaved parmesan. You read that right. And once the popcorn is gone, a small lake of bacon fat puddles at the bottom.Pork Belly Confit- Apple puree, cider gastirique & frisee salad. Strange but delicious. Getting a little salad on your fork and then the pork is the way to go.Sweet Potato Cakes- Ginger, garlic & curry spices with red pepper cream. Oh Momma. So OMFG good. Sweet potato and curry is the way to my heart. Hombre Burger- Smoked poblano pepper, \u00a0avocado, Chihuahua cheese, red pepper crema & tortilla strips. So unnecessary, because we were busting at the seams full, but so amazing. The burger was cooked a little medium for my medium-well ordering, but it didn't matter once I took a bite into that gooey, spicy goodness. And the hidden gem on the plate?

To my right were giant windows revealing massive vats of beers being brewed to perfection. How disappointed I was to find out none of these beers were ready for the day! One o'clock and they had no homebrews ready for me!The tag team combo of Yanyao N and Aurore L had managed to spill water all over the place but that did not deter us and the menus were laminated to prevent our clumsiness from slowing down our decision making! We agreed on some bacon fat popcorn for $4, although I felt like two orders would have been wiser! I helped myself to a Left Hand Milk Stout after the waitress informed me that the guest brews were unavailable :(The bacon and the popcorn and the melted cheese on top was a veritable treat and the size of the order was good enough to eat politely and not earn an early food coma. There were big pieces of bacon crumbled over with freshly grated cheese melted over the tasty treat. \u00a0Not long after came my Working Man Burger featuring cheddar cheese and bacon.Having seen one person politely slice their burger in half, I contemplated the same. Instead, I decided to attack my burger like a Great White Shark and took the biggest bite I could! The garlic mashed potatoes and fries I had on my plate were delightful and Judy M had no such dilemma of whether or not to engulf her food as she was the only one eating something healthy in the form of a salad. The server came to check on us and we were doing fine.Nice interior and I was surprised to see the big TV at the bar showing the Cubs game.

I hope they decide to brew more dark beers.I would have liked to see more vegan-friendly dishes on the menu. They highlight several items as vegetarian, but most (the pizzas, the salads) have cheese. The tempeh Rueben is noted as having vegan dressing, but then they don't offer soy cheese to replace the swiss. Without the cheese, it doesn't have much taste to it. I had the smoked tofu sandwich, which had a lot more flavour, with plenty of sundried tomatoes and beer onions. I appreciated that the server checked to make sure that sandwich was vegan. The frittes, while still good, didn't stand out as much as I expected for being hand-cut. The other vegan entree right now is a lentil, quinoa and veggie dish.While it seemed busy, we were able to get a table right away on a Sunday evening. (Though the host was rather confused/confusing, telling us about how we can wait in the little cocktail area, then in the next sentence that there were tables available.) It was pretty noisy with music blasting and everyone's conversations bouncing off the walls and ceiling. The decor is pretty neat though; I enjoyed following their blog to see how they acquired and re-purposed materials.Since it's in the neighbourhood, I'm sure I'll be back. Note that they are running low on some of their brews because people are drinking it faster than they can make it. I hope they are able to adjust over the coming weeks to sort out the kinks in starting a new restaurant and brewery. I also hope they offer more vegan options so I can balance out the booze!", "Date": "2010-03-16", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "mcquake j.", "ReviewID": "o3W1gzWjNtTFomtEZcKphQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not designed to be able to resist a burger topped with pulled pork.

That was when you could just walk in and grab a table. Now the world knows about Revolution and the great vibe and beer (just won a few Gold Medals) and getting a table is far more complicated. Luckily I went on a weeknight and it was just Anne and me.First and foremost the beer is extremely good and could be my favorite of the city brewpubs (though Piece is also fantastic). The space is really cool too with a fireplace, a long double sided bar and a wood fire pizza oven in the back. There's also a small section of seating on a second level \"loft\" area over looking the bar. It's not a huge space but there's plenty of room to pack in the people. I also love the detail put into the bar with their fist logo used in wooden columns.The menu is pretty standard modern bar food with sandwiches, pizzas, starters and few entrees/salads. It's a nice balance of small plate bar finger food or make a meal out of any combination of larger plates. Anne let/made me order so I went with one pizza (Arugula), one sandwich (pulled pork) and a starter (black bean mole lettuce wraps). The pizza was good but nothing special and I was disappointing the crust was not crisp at all, more soggy/doughy. The lettuce wrap was a complete failure and I question what I was thinking ordering it in the first place. The mole was a black paste that had a strange consistency and everything else in the wrap didn't add anything to the mess. Oh well. The sandwich was good and large - a pretty standard pulled pork creation. It needed more sauce and I didn't have the energy/courage to ask for more. The fries were also tasty.Revolution is a place I want to love. The beer is great, the space is interesting and the service is attentive. I think the food selection I had was mediocre and I don't know if that was just one night or not. The value is a bit strange and seemed expensive ($10 sandwich, $12 pizza, $11 starter + beer) though the individual items don't seem high (maybe all the beer pushed the check up). My advice: try a lot of beer, get a sandwich/burger and/or a lot of finger food. The pizzas are probably hit and miss but with a solid crowd, good beer and interesting food, it's worth checking out (and I should return for a second chance).

They don't sell ranch, can you believe that?!?! Well, maybe you can't bring in your own ranch, per se, but you should be allowed to since they don't have any available to customers. We beat up our server, Carlos, pretty bad over this, but it was explained to us that Revolution Brewing Co. doesn't have ranch because, other than condiments, everything on the pub menu is homemade, which didn't really make sense since ranch is a condiment. They should really have a homemade ranch, since it's the greatest condiment ever made, but their food was still great without it, which is really the point of this review. For an appetizer, we got the Crispy Calamari, which was amazing. It had almond, romesco sauce, and Parmesan cheese. It's probably the best Calamari I've had in a long time. Do keep in mind, though, that Revolution Brewing does not have marinara sauce. I know, I know. What's up with this place and its lack of condiments? The calamari was so good with the cheese that it really didn't need marinara, but it's something to think about.For an entree, I ordered the Pesto Chicken Sandwich. Also amazing. It had a pesto sauce, bacon, gouda and arugula on a herb loaf bread. The flavors were spot on. Spot on! I got it with a caesar salad, but I could have chosen from a variety of different sides, such as fries and other stuff.

The Belgian Wit is pretty good although I was annoyed that they decided to brew a wit for winter. My seasonal snobbery aside, it may actually be a little too heavy on the coriander for my taste. The Iron Fist Pale Ale is good but after I drank it I immediately forgot about it and ordered a Dogfish Head. Don't waste your time with the Workingman Mild. It is low in alcohol and also low on flavor. Of the beers that they had on tap I'd have to say my favorite was the Cross of Gold. At many brew pubs that I've been to they try and make their lightest beer as close to a miller/bud kind of ale as possible to please the masses but this one had a nice hoppy kick to it that was well received by my entire party. Ultimately though, we all end up ordering drinks and beers off of their guest microbrew menu. As for the food: Bacon Fat Popcorn was pretty good but I felt it to be something you could easily recreate in your own kitchen. $4 for a yummy little snack while waiting for your food and enjoying beers however is a pretty good steal so why not go for it? Bruchetta was just okay. We had one of each and the only two that I enjoyed were the roasted cauliflower and duck confit. I probably would not order again. The mussels are fantastic. The first time I went we ordered the more traditional white ale, celery, shallot and bay leaf. The waiter at that time tried to recommend the hard cider, blue cheese, leek and fuji apple to us but we kind of brushed him off and went with what we knew. They were very good and plentiful. On my second visit however I went for the other variety and was extremely happy with the choice. I wanted to put a straw in the bucket and drink the juice from the bottom. My only complaint with the mussles is the amount of bread that is served is not sufficient for the way I like to enjoy my mussles. They only give you two thin slices of garlic bread and if you order more it's $1 a slice. Cremini mushroom pizza and mustard herb chicken sandwich were both quite good as well although next time I'll be ordering a burger because I've heard great things about them. My vegan friend has tried both vegan sandwiches and said they were both quite good. The atmosphere is hip but not pretentious. I went on a Saturday night once and it was packed but the wait was only about 30 minutes. Parking has also been very easy. On both visits I parked a couple doors down from the restaurant. Overall, Revolution Brewing is a good place to go with a group of friends and/or family. It has good food, even better prices and an extensive beer list.

I am a beer lover and this place totally hits the spot.I'd been forewarned about difficulty finding open seating after a certain point, so I headed on down here mid-afternoon ish on a Friday.

No big deal; I figured I could drink my beer at the counter behind the bar and that would be fine, if only slightly awkward since I'd come alone.As I stood at the bar waiting to be helped, the couple next to me (a woman, seated, and her significant other, standing at her side) stood up and turned to me, informing me they were leaving and I could have their seat. Awesome!As for the beer, I don't remember exactly what I ordered, but I told someone working what kinds of beers I like and was brought a pint which I then enjoyed while reading a book.And because (good) beer begs to be paired with food, I ordered the bruschetta appetizer, which is uniquely made and totally delicious. I was going to order a second glass of the beer, when I saw they had Lagunitas Chicago-Style Ale. WHAT?! Here I am, a California native living just down the road from Lagunitas Brewery, a place with which I am incredibly familiar, and I'd never even heard of the beer. Turns out, it's a Chicago specialty, offered only at select bars for a limited time. Obviously, I couldn't resist.Of course, that beer was fantastic as well... Revolution is all about good beer - whether it's their own or good beer made by other microbreweries.

They do a final rinse of their glasses with this upward-squirting fountain spray thing before they serve their beer. \u00a0According to the bartender we spoke with, this helps certain beers retain their head better. \u00a0Gotta love a brewery that focuses on the little things to make their beers more enjoyable.3. \u00a0Speaking of their bartenders -- nice, friendly people all around. \u00a0We sat at the bar and all three bartenders helped us and chatted with us throughout our evening. \u00a04. Revolution has a circular bar that is undoubtedly the focal point once you step inside. \u00a0Given that Revolution is a brewery, this makes complete sense to me.5. One more thing about the bar -- it's held up by these wooden pillars shaped like a raised fist (a la their logo). \u00a0Very cool. \u00a06. Their mussels with hard cider, blue cheese, leeks and fuji apples are not like mussels you'll find anywhere else. \u00a0See the broth that sits at the bottom of the bowl? \u00a0Blue cheese goodness that can seriously be eaten with a spoon (that's what I did).7. Though it's located in Logan Square, Revolution attracts plenty of folks who don't fit the hipster bill. \u00a0Take as that as you like but don't be surprised to see lots of folks boasting a 60614 zip code.8. There's not a whole lot going on around Revolution. \u00a0I view that as a good thing because we were able to find street parking with no problem, aside from having to avoid hitting the people on bikes up and down Milwaukee Ave.9. In case you're wondering, they don't take reservations. \u00a0When we arrived at 9:30 PM on a Saturday night, we were quoted a 25 minute wait. \u00a0But seating at the bar is first come, first serve so we were able to grab a couple empty stools right away.10.

Those were just too thick and weren't very homemade at all, don't ever pair a sandwich with mashed potatoes. Major fail.

We got the bacon fat popcorn appetizer for $4. It was a decent size and would probably be best shared between more than just 2 people. It was maybe a little too salty, but it's popcorn so it's supposed to be salty and we obviously aren't health nuts to have ordered something called bacon fat popcorn. There were bacon pieces in it and maybe some cheese and parsley on top (not entirely sure what it was, but it looked like it could be that). We also shared the smokehouse pizza. In hindsight, we should have picked only one item with bacon since I felt like a pig for eating so much pig, plus the grease started to get to me. Completely my own fault, I know. The pizza was thin crust, 10 inches, and it worked well to share between two people, since we're skinny girls who also got the popcorn appetizer. I'd say get one per person if you're really hungry, not getting appetizers or dessert, or if you're a big football player or tall type guy. There were a lot of delicious-sounding pizzas to choose from. Our runner up choice was something like a stuffed baked potato pizza, but they also had margarita, something with seitan, something with arugula, and something with butternut squash, among others. Even though we ordered meat-lovers things, they had an impressive selection of vegetarian items, conveniently indicated on the menu. In hindsight I kind of wish is tried one of those since most of them sounded really good. The menu also included burgers, salads, and some miscellaneous things like fish and chips and steaks. To drink we both ordered dark stouts on tap. They had a special since it was for St. Patrick's day for an Irish car bomb float, which was made of their paddy stout, baileys Irish cream ice cream, and Jameson Irish whiskey whipped cream. I ordered that but had them put the ice cream and whipped cream in a dish on the side, which they did without giving me any trouble. OMG the ice cream and whipped cream was amazing!!!! Seriously awesome. That was by far my favorite part of the experience. The waiter was good but nothing special. He got our order right and wasn't hard to track down but he wasn't particularly personable or helpful. We sat upstairs, which is a cute area with a fireplace and couches, although we were just at normal table. There were a decent number of people there but it wasn't crowded. They have a stage upstairs so I assume they have bands there sometimes, but I didn't notice anything saying who or when.

I arrived at 5:30 and sat at the bar until my date arrived. The interior is impressive, lots of wood, a huge bar in the center of the restaurant, painted tin ceiling, and the brewery is in full view from the dining room. I ordered the Bottom Up Belgian Wit. It was good, but lacked something I can't describe. I was chewing gum before I came in, so Wrigley's Extra may be to blame.We were seated immediately once my date arrived, and ordered more beer (the Cross of Gold for me, the flight for her) and the hard cider and blue cheese mussels. The Cross of Gold was a tasty and clean, slightly hoppy ale. The cider and blue cheese mussels arrived and were... absolutely the best mussels I've ever tasted. A more perfect combination of flavors I cannot imagine... the mussels were plump and plentiful, and cider, blue cheese, leeks, and julienned Fuji apples formed the broth.I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese pizza, and I was impressed, again, although it's not difficult to impress me with mushrooms and goat cheese. The crust was thicker than a Neapolitan-style pizza, but so incredibly light, and held its shape well. They must have sauteed the mushrooms in crack. The pizza was just intoxicating.The service was excellent from both the host and our server. If I have any issues, one is the beer did not absolutely wow me. It was solid and tasty, but not overwhelming. I guess I expected a bit more. Also, the acoustics in the restaurant are horrible. Conversing across the table was nearly impossible.

This is the place that we have been waiting on pins and needles to open. A brewery! In our backyard! Whoo hoo! So, we went in to try it as soon as we could: Lunch on Saturday.When we came in at about 12:45 we were told it would be a 20 minute wait. That was fine. One of my friends hadn't even arrived yet, so we just got a spot at the bar and ordered a few beers. What a beautiful bar it was! Very big. Beautiful wood. Four carved fists \"holding up\" the upper bar. As well, all of the beer taps are also these fists.To one side of the bar are some booths, up in an elevated area. To the other side are tables and a \"lounge area\" with a fireplace. In the back, through some stained glass windows is the actual brewery.Also, there are only one or two TVs in the whole place. My friend heard the owner isn't a fan.. so this is not where you want to go to watch sports.When my other friend arrived we chatted a bit and had another beer. A table near us opened up and we realized that our names hadn't been called yet, so I checked in with the hostess stand. There was a mix up, they thought they'd seated our party, so they seated us immediately at the open table.Our waiter was a friendly guy. I wish I'd have gotten his name. He told us about how he is in a band and lives next door and heard 2 years ago that a brewery was opening. From that time on he's been jockeying to get a job at Revolution Brewery. He told us all about the beer and food. All of the bread is baked in-house, everything is made there. The pork is from a local (IL) farm and the bacon and pulled pork and everything is made on-site.We tried the bacon fat popcorn and you know, the popcorn was good, but I didn't think it was worth all the hype. It wasn't a favorite for us. We also got the applewood smoked chicken wings. I'm not a huge wing fan, but my friends really liked them.For our meals, Friend 1 got the forest burger with blue cheese potato salad. I got the mustard herbed chicken sandwich with garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes. Friend 2 got the pulled pork with hand-cut fries.Everyone liked what they had to eat. My chicken was so flavorful and tender. And the baked in-house bread was delicious too. My mouth just watered a little bit thinking about it.The service at Revolution has kinks to be worked out. Our waiter was great, but our wait for the food was long. And there was the slip up with our wait. I'm not saying this as digs really against them. It's totally to be expected given that they had just opened a few days ago. Also, the waiting line to get in exploded just after we arrived. The crowds here are huge right now. We weren't the only ones excited for Rev Brew's opening!Oh, and the beer? Revolution has 5 of their own beers on tap right now. Between the 3 of us we tried each one at least once. Our favorites were the Eugene, a dark Guiness-like beer; Workingman Mild, a kind of toffee/caramel-y beer; and the Iron Fist Pale Ale, a hoppy American ale. Aside from their own beer, Revolution also had a really extensive list of other beers they serve, including some from other Chicago brewers like Goose Island and Half Acre. We only drank the house-made beer, but it was nice to know we weren't limited to just 5 choices.We will definitely be back to Revolution Brewery.

On it they had a savory tart, squash soup, lamb chops, and spiced creme brulee as the four servings. Of those items the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the squash soup were the only dishes that had any personality to them really. The opening tart was eh okay and the lamb chops served over lentils tasted bland. The beer pairings for $15 extra didn't seem necessary as only the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e seemed to be the only one to have any similarity to its associated pour (Night Moves - Black wheat ale which was tasty with a cool name :)The other three pours were fine, just that they really had no matching personality to their paired dishes.All in all would I do the tasting Prix Fixe again? Probably not. Our server was decent but overall the whole experience was uninspiring and disappointing.Would I visit Revolution again?

I don't make it into the city too often, so this was a real treat to go here.I'll start with the food: it was amazing. I am a vegetarian and had the tofu revolution sandwich with a spicy mustard and swiss cheese - DELICIOUS! I like tofu anyway, so a lot of you are probably shaking your heads at that statement and saying \"screw that, where's the meat?,\" But for all my veggie comrades out there, this vegetarian sandwich was a hit. The fries are delicious and the portions were perfect. We ordered the cheese plate as an appetizer but unfortunately our waiter forgot. They were SUPER busy on a Saturday afternoon at 2:30pm, and I go easy on the wait staff at any place because it's a stressful job when it's that busy. He came by and apologized (caught it himself, no one told him), which we appreciated and didn't give the guy a hard time. He did a good job overall.I had the Coup D'Etat, the Double Fist, and the Anti-Hero (which I've had before in the suburbs). I ended up taking a growler home of the Coup D'Etat. I would have purchased multiple growlers if it didn't mean I'd have about 5 of them in my fridge, lol.I love that this place exists. It's on par with Half Acre in terms of city breweries, although I have to give Revolution the upper hand because I like their beer slightly better, plus they have food (not just food, but GOOD food).

We had gone for opening weekend but like any good revolution, word had spread fast, the logan square citizens were restless, and thus the place was packed elbow to elbow around the central square bar area. We only had drinks on that crowded, chaotic, rainy weekend and it would be unfair to write a review based on that experience.That was maybe a month and a half ago, and today I returned to try my hand at lunch. Nearly every table was filled so it continues to be popular spot. I got there a little early for meeting up with a friend so I appreciate the fact that they have a pretty decent sized waiting area with a row of wooden benches and barrels cut in half to serve as a table and/or ottoman (another person waiting there propped her feet on top). My friend and I were seated in the lofted second floor area which had a great view of the overall layout of the brewery. This is definitely preferred seating so I would suggest asking specifically for the balcony area overlooking the ledge. The brewery is spacious and clean - no worries about day old beer smell. It is also surprisingly kid friendly for lunch as I saw a lot of families in the mix.I had a bloody mary instead of a beer (hey, it was lunchtime). I am very selective about my bloody mary's and I have to say I was pretty impressed with this one! The flavors were good and well balanced. It came with a garnish of two huge cheese cubes and a stick of olives. I think 2 cubes was overkill - 1 would have been fine and I would have preferred another garnish with it instead, like celery, or better yet, a pickle (man, stick a pickle in a bloody mary and you have something truly golden). We started with the Sweet Potato Cakes which were pretty good. A friend had told me avoid the Tempeh Reuben which I did and instead ordered the Cremini Mushroom since I adore goat cheese. The pizza was good but I actually enjoyed a taste of my friend's Arugula pizza more.

A little underwhelming, is how I would describe it. But I understand a new restaurant sometimes has to work out some kinks and I will \u00a0give it another try. Also, all the hype may have elevated my expectations to an unrealistic level. The room is cool - yet a little cold if that makes sense. It's a lofty space with modern and unique fixtures, a fireplace and a glass wall in the back where you can see the beer a-brewin. The only thing that was off is that the lights were very bright - which threw the ambiance off a bit for me. It just didn't have that cozy, warm vibe I like in a brew pub.Speaking of brew, their house brewed? Eh.. I wasn't a big fan. I thought all the house brewed beers were too similar and didn't have a lot of character. I had a flight of four and the one that stood out the most was the stout. I am used to a stout having a creamy head - and there was none to speak of. Also, it tasted a bit hoppy/skunky for a stout. They all had the same perfumey quality for me in taste and aroma & no depth/oomph which made them taste so similar. I didn't get it. The beer coulda/shoulda been a little colder too. Hey, I'm no beer nerd but I do have taste buds - so take this with a grain of salt. The beet salad was tasty but I wish there were some mixed greens instead of just romaine. It would have been good with some gold beets too. It seemed a little uninspired. The tempeh ruben was disappointing. If you are going to do a vegetarian version of something - I think some effort should be made to get it as close to the real thing in texture and taste as possible. I didn't get that with the tempeh - it seemed to have some spice that made me think Mexican but I can't put my finger on it.

The menu was different enough to be memorable, and in a strange turn of events I opted for the Tofu Revolution sandwich with fries. To drink, I asked for the darkest brew in the house and was served a chilled goblet of Mad Cow, their milk stout.Let's start with the beer/ the primary reason why you would cone here. It was good. Really, that's all I have to say. I've had quite a few milk stouts and it wasn't any better and not much worse than they were. At this moment my first impressions were melting. The average tasting beer made me realize how manufactured an corporate the interior is, and while it's definitely clean, it also lacks character. Then the food came out.For a tofu sandwich, this packed punch. By far the most interesting an filling (in a good way) tofu dish I've had. The bread tasted like it was baked minutes ago, the spiciness mixed well with the black beans, plantains, and salsa, and the tofu manage to add something to the overall taste instead of just playing it's normal role as a background filler.All in all the food made me second guess my opinion on the beer, but I have to say 3 stars.

Besides, who couldn't resist checking out a place with their own Gonzo fist-like beer taps! We finally got in last night and it was a damn good experience. We were told an hour and 15 minute wait for a table which was fine because we were able to grab a beer at the bar. After enjoying a Eugene porter and an Iron Fist pale ale, respectably, and stepping out for a cig, we were escorted to our table. 45 minutes - not bad at all. So we had to try the Bacon Fat Popcorn, which seems gimmicky, but it was another reason we wanted to check the place out in the first place. It was alright and I recommend ordering it just for the experience. I also ordered the Cheddar Ale Soup because of fellow Yelper's reviews. Well that and I'm just partial to beer cheese soup. I must say, the soup was good. Thick, probably really high in sodium, but good. It would have gone great with like a sliced apple or something to cut the creamy, salty, cheesy goodness.For our entr\u00e9es I ordered the Flemish Beef Stew, again on the recommendation of others, and it was delicious. Probably one of the best stews I've had in Chicago. My friend ordered the Smokehouse Burger medium-rare and it came out perfect. I tried a bit of it and the pulled pork with pepper jack cheese was a great topping combination. I'm definitely going to get a burger the next time I'm in. The food was filling and tasty and my friend commented on how it was the first time he witnessed me eat everything as opposed to taking leftovers home in a to go box.The ambience and d\u00e9cor of the restaurant itself was very warm and welcoming. The fireplace and open kitchen/ brewery were nice along with the whiskey, wine, or beer cask wood that makes up the wall on the south side of the bar. It does seem though as if Wicker Park has kind of snuck north up Milwaukee a bit. And I don't really quite mind as I didn't see any North Face coats last night. However it is gentrification at its best and along with the good food, beer, and atmosphere will come the masses and their UGGs.Still not too sure about the name Revolution Brewing Company. I read the \"about us\" history and there seems to be nothing extraordinarily revolutionary going on. No leftwing political agenda, not even a manifesto or the like that we've seen from a familiar looking red star'd brewery (Rogue). Maybe it's just a ploy to get all the bearded, utopian socialist Che fans that live in Logan and the surrounding areas to come out and spend an extra buck on some revolutionary yummy food and booze. Who knows? And whatever - I'm game. \u00a0 \u00a0All in all, the bartenders were quick to notice us and offer a beer list even though the bar was crowded 2 rows deep (seated customers and those hovering behind them). Our server was attentive, friendly, and quick. The food was tasty and priced accordingly. The beer was delicious even though I only drank the porter which was right up my alley. I highly recommend this joint for a date with your new bohemian proletariat girlfriend, dinner with your hipster - bike kid friends, or just for taking mom and dad out when they're in town so you can finally try the Hampshire-Duroc Pork Chop and get them to pay for it.See you again soon RBC!", "Date": "2010-02-11", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Dan H.", "ReviewID": "LJ3dU65Ongmiik7a6wA2rw", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I have been going to revolution since it opened.1) The beer is great.

I had the Hombre burger: smoked poblano pepper, \u00a0avocado, Chihuahua cheese, red pepper crema & tortilla strips - yum. It was huge and I could only eat half - plus all the fries. My bf had some of the best beef stew I've ever tasted - super gourmet: slow braised in mild ale and balsamic vinegar with garlic cream cheese mashed potato, french bean and carrots. Perfect. His brother had the smoked buffalo chicken pizza which gave us an idea of both their pizzas and their wings. Holy buffalo tomato sauce! It was tasty though. I was happy to taste a few of their items and can't wait to go back to try more. It seems as though you can keep going back and have a completely different dining experience as far as their different foods. I've heard the blue cheese potato salad is delish so I'll have to keep that in mind. As far as beer, I'm a wheat/Belgian fan and thought the Cross of Gold and the Bottom Up Belgian were good.

Really. Best overall brewpub I've been to in Chicago.Food....The Bacon Fat Popcorn is pretty much the greatest thing on earth. No, I'm not kidding. A near perfect combination of bacon grease without being too much, popcorn, shaved (Parmesan?) cheese, bacon, and toasted oregano or some other leaf. Amazing.Burgers...The Workingman can go toe to toe with any other top end burger I've had in the city. A thick juicy patty, hunk of cheddar, generous slabs of bacon, and beer soaked onions? I mean, do I need to say more? The Hombre' and Forest burgers are also lovely, but for my money, the Workingman is where it's at. Entree...I have sampled the Flemish beef stew and the Iron Fist fish and chips. Both are outstanding. The stew was lovely, the meat came apart with a spoon. Pizza...I've had several, I don't remember which ones specifically, but they were all great. Cooked well, chewy but not too chewy crust, but crispy at the edges. Done right.Brunch...The egg in a hole is awesome. These guys should guard their hollandaise recipe like a mama grizzly watches her kids. Their breakfast pizza is outstanding as well, that's my go to favorite. Get the bacon, you won't regret it.Beer...I've had all their regular brews. The Iron Fist, Anti-Hero, and Cross of Gold are my favorites. Their Eugene porter is a great one as far as porters go. I must say, I think Piece edges out Rev for overall beer quality, but Rev has also been open for a year or so.

It's all very well considered--and though it still looks a little too polished to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood, I think it's only a matter of time before Revolution becomes more of a local staple and less of a shiny new kid in town.

It's always packed when I go, however it never feels crowded. They have a nice little waiting area sectioned off that you can sit and order beer while you wait for a seat. They have also expanded to a second floor within the last year which has really helped the wait time. Beer: Always a great selection. Something for everyone. The Coup D'etat and Eugene Porter are my go to's. I'm a stout lover and I went once where they were out of the two stouts that I initially ordered. The waiter then came back with samples of 5 different porters and stouts they had available. Great service. Food: Bacon popcorn. This is what initially drew me to this place. I will say, that 50% of the time I order this appetizer, it isn't fresh and is...dare I say even stale. It's still delicious though, it's just that it's to die for when you get a freshly made batch. I have never had a bad meal here. Burgers are tasty and cooked exactly how you want them. Pizzas are just the right size and the sauce is just right. Their garlic mashed potatoes....can't get enough.

I don't remember the name of it, but I seem to recall it was an oatmeal stout that had been aged in the barrels with the cherries. I liked it a lot. (It had an aroma a bit like some of my own homebrewed dark meads, tho I could not actually taste the cherry.)The other one I tried was the Weegene, a small beer brewed from the second running of the Hugene imperial porter. It was strong-tasting, dark and smoky, and frankly, not to my taste, but I can tell it was well-crafted. I'm not usually a dark beer drinker, but I decided to try the Foursome Quadurpel with my meal. I was quite happy with it, which may have had something to do with the over 10% alcohol.So, on to the food! To start off, we had to try the bacon fat popcorn topped with parmesian. It was extremely yummy. Then we munched on the polenta fries with giardinera and tomato aioli. Excellent.We ordered the cheese plate, because the crackers that come with it are made from the spent grain used in the brewing process onsite. The cheese was a snow white cheddar and a baked honey-glazed cheese. (I didn't catch the name of the third type.) I liked the compote and almonds too, but since I'm not a fan of beets, I gave the beet-preserved eggs a miss. The cheese perfectly complimented the crackers and was served on a rather entertaining trencher shaped like a giant mousetrap.I was trying to balance the calories of the nice beer, so I opted for the duck comfit salad, with goat cheese, pears, spinach, pistachios in a nice citrus vinagrette.

I agree with the other reviewers, don't come here thinking you're going to be ordering anything low-cal or low-fat. You are going to leave here feeling like a bloated, bloated mess. Like \"ugh, what have I done to my body.\"Bacon fat and shredded cheese on popcorn...need I say more? Actually, there are a few healthier choices on the menu but the choices everyone seems to rave about are the more indulgent ones. My recommendation? If you're going to have something fatty, balance it out with some of the less artery-clogging items on the menu like the mussels or a salad and you'll be a lot happier.

I heard a lot about this place and I've read the reviews for some time now. Finally, I was in the Logan Square are today, texted a friend, and before I knew it, we had plans to hit RB at 8PM.So glad we did! Let's just say it was one of those damn days where all I wanted was a vodka rocks. So I did! I was waiting up for my friend and ordered a Ketel One on the rocks. Bill came...$8. I was shocked! I braced myself for the usual $10 plus tip and was thrilled to see a vodka rocks ring up in single digits. Finally my friend arrived and we were promptly seated against the wall. I have to get it out of the way, but I love the atmosphere and decor. It was loud, but a good loud where you can still hear the person sitting across from you. Awesome dark wood throughout with the cool globe lights. I was a fan. We decided not to get an appetizer because nothing looked too appetizing to me. I don't like cheese plates and the popcorn didn't sound appetizing. No big deal.As the token vegetarian-leaning-vegan friend, I went with the Tempeh Reuben. Seriously, this thing was a monster. Amazing! I still can't get over how spicy it was with the cheese and mayonnaise on toasted rye bread. It's been a long week so I went with the fries, which were also fantastic. My friend went ahead with the Rappini pizza and I'm going to say...that was this reason this place didn't get 5 stars. I just wasn't impressed with the pizza. I'd eat it just because I'm a food machine, but compared to the Reuben, I was left expecting a little more. Service was cool. I was a little disappointed that we didn't receive water refills and it was a little warm in there. Not too big a deal...but refilling waters should be second nature. I hate to be nit picky, but that just stood with me. After all that...I will be back. I'm going to be dreaming about the Tempeh Reuben tonight.

They serve it with dressing on the side which was nice because I didn't feel like it needed the dressing but my friend did, so I'm glad they did that without us asking.

It won out over Chicago Diner as our choice because of the beer and non-veggie options on the menu for my wife. The food was indeed quite good, although they use too much salt, especially on the fries. This is a common problem with vegetarian food preparation, especially when tofu is the protein, in many restaurants. As noted, the day was gorgeous ... the first day in the 70s after a very unpleasant heat wave. Thus, everyone seemed to be out. The traffic in Chicago was horrible, especially because the reversible lanes on the Kennedy (I-90) were closed for repairs. Parking in the Logan Square area was an interesting challenge. I mention the weather, because it must have had something to do with the crowd in the restaurant. The packed house of people glad to be out combined with the tin ceiling made the noise level deafening. I realize this makes me sound like an old fart, which I suppose I am, but we enjoy conversation with our meals and it was nearly impossible until the crowd thinned out ever-so-slightly. We sat at the front window, which was the noisiest location, probably because of the glass and the small waiting area between us and the main part of the dining room. We would definitely recommend not sitting by the windows. People watching is good there, but that is all.Pro: Good food, beer, service and vegetarian options. Con: NoiseBottom Line: Not going back because of the noise level. Rating: Should be a 4 based on the food and beer or a 1 based on the noise level.Aside: Probably just to prove that I am an old fart, I do not understand why restaurants play music when there is such a large crowd. It clearly does not add to anyone's enjoyment.

But if you hang around the bar for a few minutes and are quick about it, you can bypass the hostesses and sit next to one another and just eat at the bar, which makes conversation over the loud music much easier.", "Date": "2011-08-09", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Jeff S.", "ReviewID": "vmXrSfY2KTQ-IqJ6MvgRwg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Finally got a chance to hit Revolution as it's been on my list for a while. \u00a0Luckily we ended up recognizing our waiter so he hooked us up with a handful of different beer samples on the house. \u00a0Having already been familiar with some of their signature beers we ventured into different areas which I typically don't care for (e.g. Porters and Stouts) which I was all pleasantly surprised with:Anti-Hero IPABottom Up WitCross of Gold Blond AleEugene PorterDouble Fist Double Pale AleIron Fist Pale AleRosa Hibiscus AleRed Scare AleRise American Stout We started out with the bacon-fat popcorn with shaved Parmesan cheese and sage to accompany the beers. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0The only negative thing I could say about this treat is that the bowl is much too small.As it was around brunch time some of the menu items were not yet available so I was unable to try the seafood dishes that looked really good, so I opted for the pork belly and egg breakfast sandwich. \u00a0The meat was wonderfully tender and not overly fatty, and the aioli and arugla added great flavor. \u00a0The redskin potatoes were also very good. \u00a0My fianc\u00e9e made a note to point out that her burger was one of the best ones she has had in recent memory.So far this is my favorite brewpub in the city when looking for food that deliveries just as much as the beer. \u00a0I'm also eagerly awaiting their new bottling/canning shipments so I can start grabbing cans of Anti-Hero at my local Binnys.", "Date": "2012-08-04", "Author_Location": "Oak Park, IL"}, {"Author": "Jeff H.", "ReviewID": "TZzxfWhAoZ7X9PgZE4Yr8Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We didn't eat there today, but we met up with some friends for drinks.Very very cool theme to this place. \u00a0Regardless of you worldview or politics, this place has a cool feel to it. \u00a0I'm not going to bore you with my politics, but I'm a big fan of 20th century world history. \u00a0When you walk into this place and see the fist beer-tap pulls, you get a woody (check out the photo gallery and you'll see what I'm talking about). \u00a0I'm a Reagan Republican and have my own opinion about the whole concept of Marxism and \"revolution\", yet I still loved the feel and respect for history this place has. \u00a0Very cool. \u00a0Our friends got a handful of appetizers... my wife and I picked at the fries and dipped them in blue cheese that came with the wings. \u00a0Tasty. \u00a0Love to go back and try some of the things on the menu. \u00a0Definitely recommend, if nothing else just for the drinks and experience.", "Date": "2010-02-13", "Author_Location": "Geneva, IL"}, {"Author": "Quinn K.", "ReviewID": "5-YH5TS_PEjNezuZgbhfhw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been here maybe 3 times and it is growing on me. \u00a0It's a really nice looking restaurant and the inside is dark and cozy. \u00a0The location is a bit far afield if you aren't familiar with Chicago but it's right in my neighborhood.

Actually, you could taste EVERY flavor in this meal and they were so perfectly paired I can't even come up with a better word to describe them. I ate every last bite of these pancakes and wished I would have savored them even longer than I did.My companion ordered the Pancetta biscuits with Italian sausage gravy and while it looked amazing, I didn't want anything to interrupt my own breakfast so I let him keep it to himself. All in all, I know that next time I'm in Chicago this is a place I NEED to visit again. I wish it were possible for me to eat breakfast, lunch, AND dinner here all in one day, but I just might go into a severe coma and require hibernation for at least a week after doing so. Their set up inside is quite lovely, very simple, lots of wood -I love that- and they even have neat little cozy corners where (apparently) there is a fireplace burning at night. I could definitely see myself coming here with friends at night for a drink or 6. They have a pretty awesome selection of beers (most of which I have never heard of), and they even have a beer-club and offer growlers which you can take home and bring back in to refill throughout the year. Why can't there be more places like this in California?! The only problem with this place is that it is a little \"out of the way\" unless you live within walking distance.

Our server came back and we both decided to order burgers, but I left it up to the decision of our server to pick a burger for me. I wound up ordering the Smokehouse Burger, which consists of a beefy patty, pepper jack cheese, and South Carolina-style pulled pork. Yeah, that's right. Burger and pulled pork. A-MAZ-ING. You're probably asking yourself where my description for the popcorn is, right? Well, it's between that last paragraph and this one.

The only thing that I came up with was that you should order it...no matter what.Now our server made a booboo. Our burgers came out and our popcorn didn't, so I asked her about it. She apologized and said that she thought she put in the order but she admitted she didn't do it. I like that she admitted her mistake, but C'MON MAN. You're getting in the way of a many and his popcorn. She had the nerve [insert sarcasm] to ask if we still wanted the popcorn.

We walked in and were greeted and told us it would be about 20-30 minute wait time. It was a beautiful night so we hung out in front of the building. within 10 minutes they came to get us. Our server was great all around, she was friendly, attentive, and brought me a sample of a beer she recommended based on what i told her i liked. It's a bar and grill so naturally it is loud but not to the point where its annoying. They had a good selection of music going and the atmosphere was relaxed. We were seated near the kitchen and got to see all the amazing dishes going out. I am always fascinated by servers that carry a ridiculous amount of hot plates at once. Now for the good stuff - the food was amazing.Appetizer - Steamed Pei Mussels in beer - delicious, we expected a small amount but this could easily be one meal. Between 2 of us it was more than enough to split. Bacon Fat popcorn - the bacon was definitely on point, not greasy and just the perfect amount of crisp - droolSandwiches - Hombre burger -hubby ordered this and he loved it, he said it was cooked just right and had the right amount of spice. The fries were made out of real potatoes and were really good.Crispy pork belly and egg - oh my gawwwd was this good. I seriously want to come in just for this again, The pork belly was crispy and juicy, not in the least bit dry and not heavy either. The egg just complimented the flavors and the aurugula gave it the right amount of freshness. One of the best sandwhiches i have ever eaten. I ordered mine with garlic mashed potatoes and they had skins in them. Yum! I had 2 pints of the Rosa beer which honestly didnt even taste like beer, hence why i drank so much.

The joint was pretty full, but our wait was supposed to be 40 minutes and turned into 15, which was great. Our friendly server helped us with the menu since it was our first time, and we got down to brass tax (or tacks? I don't know).The food was fantastic from start to finish. We got the bacon fat popcorn and wings to split amongst us as a starter, and both were quite good. My wife got the burger and myself the vegetarian chili dog even though I'm a carnivore. Marinated tofu smothered in vegetarian chili and avocado on a bun, it was amazing! I rarely find a great vegetarian dish, but this one hit the spot (not too surprising given the owners have a hand in Handlebar, another great spot for vegetarians). My wife's burger was perfectly done as well. I think between the menu and specials one could never get bored with the food.While the food here is top-notch, the clear winner is the beer. We tried a bunch of the housebrews, all of which were great examples of the styles. My personal favorites were the Eugene Porter and the Anti-Hero IPA, which might be the best IPA I've ever had on draft (so much hop flavor and aroma, but totally balanced right). I'm quite psyched these guys are canning soon.In short, if you like brewpub fare and a great atmosphere, I cannot stress how good a spot this would be for you.

Generally, it is my experience that places have a tendency to cook your burger more than you want them to. Revolution did the opposite. I ordered my burger medium rare. It came out RARE. The burger patty itself was underseasoned and lacking flavor. The beer onions on the burger were good.My boyfriend's burger was properly cooked to a medium rare, so not sure what transpired here.As for the sides, my boyfriend opted for a salad.

I've been there twice already, and I knew then that I would come back many times, even if it is just to have the same thing over and over.I can safely say I've never had a tastier pretzel than the one I tried that first night at Revolution. You know it's not something that was ready-made to pop into the microwave, and the mustard was just as tangy and piquant as I like a good dipping mustard to be. Warm, soft, filling...yuuuuummmm!!!I also had the sweet potato cakes. The sauce that covers them tastes as authentic as any Indian masala sauce found in a Devon St. Indian restaurant, which was a totally on-point red curry cream sauce. The veggie chili wasn't spectacular, but it was still good and got its point across.The second visit is what really sold me on the place. This time, I chose the tempeh reuben, something that I've been wanting to try ever since I saw this one chick chomping on one the last time I was at Earwax Cafe. Holy moly!I'm going to start with the salad. You wouldn't expect a brewery to come out and give you a kick-ass salad, but they did. It was a large one, there was no iceberg lettuce in it, it was chock full of a variety of veggies, and it was just good. Good, good, goody-good, good!Now onto the sandwich. The sauerkraut was crisp and tangy with just the right amount of vinegary goodness that you want in a sauerkraut without the sogginess of the cabbage that you can usually expect. The pumpernickel bread was lightly toasted and the perfect companion to the rich flavors of the tempeh. The sandwich was so filling that I had to force myself to finish the whole thing, actually, that's not totally accurate. It was so tasty that I didn't want to stop eating it in spite of being more stuffed than a Christmas goose.I'm not even that big of a drinker these days, but I was also a fan of the drink called the \"Stray Bulliet,\" a drink made with Bulliet Bourbon, which I happen to be a fan of. It was a mixed drink that didn't sacrifice the taste of either the liquor or sweet stuff it was mixed with, which I think was a ginger and lemon simple syrup. Needless to say, this is definitely a new go-to spot for me. My stomach was immensely pleased. Staff is friendly and service is pretty good, especially considering the popularity of the establishment.

From the smoky chicken wings (with amazing blue cheese potatoes), to the chorizo pizza, to the various burgers their flavors are big, unapologetically spicy and in your face. I've eaten there probably 8 or 10 times and have yet to have a bad meal there.As for the beers, well, they are capable craftsman, offering beers with personality, distinctive character, with many exhibiting obvious hop character. There's always a pretty good range \u00a0to choose from, including Belgian styles, some nice takes on Stouts and Porters, and many of the kind of pale ales and IPA's you'd expect from a brew pub. They also have guest draughts that round out their own offerings quite nicely. I typically sit at the bar, where service is OK. Most of the bartenders are very low key, which is great, but some maybe to the point where a few might come off as uninterested. Generally wait staff folks are competent and usually pretty responsive. The third part of the experience at Revolution is the atmosphere and interior. Really well designed, artfully decorated with some very unique and custom details. The fist sculptural elements that support the upper bar are beautifully carved, and really drive home the theme that revolution is trying to put across - bold, unapologetic, in your face beer and food! Its got everything going for it, and the crowds on evenings and weekends tends to support that. If your looking for a quieter, low key experience, weekday lunchtime is much less crowded -- for now.

I thought the beef stew sounded good, but I didn't get it because who's ever heard of a $16 beef stew? Well, there is so much tender beef in it that it is worth the price. However, we both would have preferred that it had more broth like a stew. To give you a sense of how unlike a stew it was, it was served side by side in the same bowl as the garlic mashed potatoes (which are great). Wonderful flavor, I just wish there was more juice/broth to go around.Now let me tell you about the burger - Oh man, what a burger! This $11 bacon cheese burger might be the biggest single-patty burger I've ever seen! I ordered it medium, as I always do, and it was cooked perfectly. If I had a dollar for every overcooked burger I've had at other places, I could probably buy a flight to Vegas. But they know how to cook a burger!

Half an hour goes by, and my friends go up to the hostess just to make sure they weren't going to be ridiculous about actually needing to see the rest of the people in our party. \u00a0My friend comes back and he tells me that our hour and a half wait begins now, despite the fact that we've already waited a half hour. \u00a0I go up to the waitress and explain that when she asked i told her that the other two people in my party were less than two minutes behind me. \u00a0At no point did she say \"well make sure they check in\" \u00a0It's not like we had a huge group here - you can seat a four top. \u00a0Anyway so she tells me that she will 'try to make up for the time\" squeeze us in etc. \u00a0So instead of waiting an hour and a half, we wait 2 hours, yay! \u00a0On top of that, we notice a four top right at the front of the restaurant that was clear, it sat open for a good 10-15 minutes. \u00a0How was that table not turned more quickly?

I had prepared myself for this, so we weren't surprised by any stretch of the imagination. Since it was a nice night we decided to kill some time outside to get out from the loud bar scene inside.Almost 60 minutes to the dot we were able to be seated, and we were lucky to have one of the tables that is up a half flight of stairs that overlooks the bar. We all put in our beer order as soon as we were seated, and the beer was promptly delivered. I went with the Fistmas Ale due to my love for seasonal beers, especially Christmas Ales. The beer was sweeter than I had anticipated, but not overly so. It also was pretty spicy, which I enjoyed, and it was a great way to start the Revolution dining experience. Shortly after our beers arrived, we all decided on our food, which was as follows:1) Bacon Popcorn: This was a must for the table... I mean, who can turn down bacon fat popcorn topped with MORE bacon?! It was incredibly bacon-y (which is an obvious observation) and very tasty. I loved the freshly grated parmesan cheese and the dry tanginess greatly accentuated the bacon. The only off-putting aspect of this dish was at the end where there was a pool of bacon grease, but that didn't bother me too much at all.2) Hombre Burger: If anything on a menu has avocado or guacamole in it or on it, I immediately gravitate towards it. My subconscious apparently always craves guacamole/avocado which, luckily for me, isn't a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination. The burger was topped with a smoked poblano pepper, avocado, chihuahua cheese, red pepper crema and tortilla strips. The smoked poblano pepper was fantastic and added a great smoky flavor to the burger. The chihuahua cheese didn't add much flavor, but just contributed the melty texture which is always welcome. I couldn't really taste the pepper creama, but it was a bright orange sauce on the burger that you couldn't miss. The tortilla strips added a crunch to the burger which kicked it up a notch. Although I'm raving about the burger's topping, the actually beef patty is where the burger fell short. I ordered it medium and it came out 100% bone dry grey, which was such a disappointment. I would've said something, but they were still busy at this point and I kept hoping that the middle of the burger would have been cooked properly, but I never saw any hint of red or pink. My boyfriend also ordered a burger medium, but his came out moreso a medium well. Perhaps this was a fluke due to the fact that we visited on a busy weekend? \u00a03) Our friends split the pork belly sandwich and they were raving about it, but I didn't nab a bite. It looked pretty messy due to the egg, but they loved it! They also ordered the sweet potato cakes and seemed a little disappointed at the fact that they had too much curry powder in them. Lastly, my boyfriend went with the Smokehouse Burger and enjoyed it as well. You get a heaping portion of fries with a sandwich/burger which are tasty, but damn near impossible to polish off.The service was great--very friendly and prompt and I LOVE the atmosphere, even when it is loud and packed. The only reason I'm knocking off a star is due to the food mishaps we've had, but I'd definitely be willing to come back and give it another shot. The beer is worth all five stars in my opinion!

General pointing and grunting made us understand that he wanted us to order already... Ordered two Pablo Picasso's (house brewed beers) a glass of Malbec, \u00a0a calamari appetizer and he was off. Conversation was limited to \"What?\" and \"Huh\" because the music was EXTREMELY LOUD. After a very looooong while, our drinks and a teeny rather puny plate of 10 palid calamari rings was set before us. The rings were decorated with almonds and pieces of grilled asparagus and sat atop a red pepper crema. Sounds really good doesn't it? Unfortunately, it was just meh.

Nice crisp lettuce leaf and actual red tasty tomato accompanied each burger. Really very, very good. I normally eat only half my burger and take the rest home, it was so delicious that before I knew it I had eaten the whole thing. The Flemish Beef Stew, however, was the star of the show. Delicious melt in your mouth meat chunks swimming in a dark, velvety sauce with root vegetables punctuating and emphasizing each delectable spoonful. In the same dish the mashed potatoes though quite good could not help but be second best.The waiter showed up after our meal had been devoured, and left the bill.

That's not at all the kind of thing I do, but my beer aficionado friends have been anxiously awaiting the opening. We went the first Friday they were open. We got there a little bit after 5pm in anticipation of a big crowd. There were 3 of us and our wait for a table was about 20 minutes and we found stools at the bar in the meantime. We were seated at a booth overlooking the bar area, and the people watching opportunities were plentiful. Not long after we were seated, the place REALLY filled up. And since the lights were on bright bright bright (too bright, but they dimmed to a crowd-wide \"oooh\" at around 7pm) I could see the best that Logan Square had to offer with clarity and only a slight beer buzz. I only saw one baby though. Must have been a slow night. \u00a0Our server was great...and we didnt get stuck with one of the hipster leggings wearing guys. LEGGINGS!!! ON A GUY?!! Man I'm old. Anyway, she was friendly, and helpful. She admitted she didnt know everything there was to know about the guest taps, because they were very recently added, but she went to ask (instead of making something up). \u00a0As for the beer...well, here's where my review falls short. I dont really like beer. I tried the chocolate porter, and I liked it, but one was enough for me. It's heavy, but tasty. My hop loving friends like the pale ale, but I think the general consensus was \"wait for the next batch.\"But the food.....man. We started out with the sweet potato cakes, and they were great. The sauce they were served with was unexpected and went well with them. I ordered the flemish beef stew and I wanted to take it home and put it in a controlled environment and see if it would reproduce. It was HEAVENLY. The mashed potatoes that came with it were the best I have EVER had, including my own and I make great mashed potatoes. My friends ordered the tempeh reuben and some sort of chicken sandwich that I cant quite remember the exact name of right now. My friend isnt a vegetarian and said that anyone would love that reuben. I didnt try it, because I'm not a fan of the reuben flavor profile. \u00a0My other friend enjoyed his chicken sandwich immensely. The other side we tried was the bleu cheese potato salad. My friends (lovers of blue cheese) thought it was great. i (hater of bleu cheese) did not try it, and I'm glad I didnt since their review was \"good, but VERY bleu cheesy.\" So the food gets an A+ from me, and I cant wait to get that stew again. In fact, I might just get the mashed potatoes. Served in a bucket maybe. Mmmm.As far as the actual establishment....here's where the loss of 1 star comes in. There are two big screen tv's over the bar. They werent on, but I feel they really detract from the classy atmosphere of the place. I dont think they're necessary, but thats just my opinion. Also, the space seems very large but somehow doesnt have as much seating as you'd expect. I think that's probably in part because of the large waiting area. It seems disproportionate to the space. \u00a0And..the bathrooms. The brewpub is GORGEOUS....they really missed out on an opportunity to make the bathrooms something special. The thought they put into the bar, with the carved pillars and the pulls on the taps. The wonderful beer barrel wall, and light fixtures made out of the metal from the beer barrels....they obviously took some time and effort on the design. I just wish it would have extended into the bathroom.Truthfully, the only reason I'm nitpicking is because there is nothing hugely wrong with this place. The food is great, the beer is on it's way to being great, and the leggings are abundant.

Everyone has been waiting for this place to open and it shows. The wait can be out of control for dinner.

The bar seats are first come first serve and you can luck out at times and score a seat there right away. The beer is good, not over the top amazing but good. My current favorite is their gold. It's an easy drinking and refreshing beer. I think they are having trouble keeping up with all the demand for the product because it seems that each time I go there is one less of their beers on tap. Seems like a good problem to have. But don't worry if they ran out of their beer they have a huge selection of other beers on tap and in the bottle. Besides the beer being excellent, the food to go along with it doesn't disappoint. I don't think I can go to Revolution without at least getting something to eat and that usually is the bacon fat popcorn. I've had the farm burger twice and both times it has been the best burger I've had. That's right Kuma lovers, the burger here is better. The bun on the burger it what makes it stand out big time. It's dense and light at the sometime. So delicious! Besides the burger and bacon fat popcorn the pizza is great and the fries are pretty rocking. The mashed potatoes were unbelievable, best I've ever had. Sure right now the wait sucks but it's worth it.

Finally, the opening happened on a random Wednesday night in February, and it was penciled in that Saturday would include a trip to Logan Square.We arrived bright and early...lunchtime, just about noon, and the place wasn't full yet, but would be when we left a few hours later. We (my husband and I) easily found a cozy spot at the bar and dug in for an afternoon of beer and eats.After persusing the beer menu, which included on tap their house-brews (5 at the moment) and about 5 others on tap (Goose Island and Metropolitan had offerings, I believe), and a solid bottle list (about 25 different, inlcuding Victory, Dogfish Head, etc)) I started with the Workingman Mild, the hubby went with the Porter, Eugene. Both were delicious. The Workingman Mild had good flavor, definitely picked up on the toffee notes the menu boasts. And, at only 3.5% ABV, a good one to stick with if you want to have a few and not get so tipsy so quickly. The hubby's Porter was solid as well, tasted coffee among other flavors. we ended up leaving with a growler as part of the mug-club package. So far so good...For those of you that are not info craft brews, not to worry. I was surprised that in addition to its solid lineup of beers, Revolution also has a full bar with an intruiging cocktail list. Didn't try any of the mixed drinks myself, as this today was about the beer for us!As we had every intention of taking our time, we didn't order lunch immediately but opted to snack on the Bacon Fat Popcorn. At $4, it really didn't make sense not to. This appetizer proved to be a steal--well worth the $4 but I could've eaten a whole other bowl myslef! The popcorn was wonderfully smoky, topped with bacon, crispy sage, and shaved parmesan...I'm never having plain, butter, popcorn again, folks!On to our next beers, I chose the Cross of Gold (golden ale) and the hubby chose the Anti-Hero IPA. I can see the Cross of Gold being a sure-fire crowd-pleaser. It's a nice everyday drinker with a crispness to it that is also very refreshing...And then you get the little hop-punch at the end. It's not overwelming, very well done. I tried the hubby's IPA...I'm not typically an IPA girl, but I can definitely see drinking one of those as well.It was time to order food, and the choices on the menu were plentiful. Altough I was very tempted to get one of their pizzas, I ended up choosing the Smokehouse Burger in the end...The burger itself has their pulled-pork on top, along with some pepper-jack cheese. It was very good, the bbq sauce on the pulled pork had a nice tang to it. Serving it on the burger (which was tender and juicy) was the best of both worlds. The fries were okay, kinda shoestring style just like at 3 Floyds. My husband got the pulled-pork and chose the blue cheese potato salad as his side. YUM! Definitely getting that potato salad next time--and it was an absolute perfect accompaniment to the pulled pork! And I am a huge fan of blue cheese...As my husband said, his meal was like, \"a taste of summer on a cold winter day.\" Both sandwiches had the same bun, which the menu says was house-baked...It was delicious as well, close to a pretzel bun, but not quite...Between the two of us, we ended up trying all 5 Revolution brews on the menu. He went back to the Porter, and I had the Iron Fist Pale Ale. Stellar. I can't wait for the Belgain Wit that's apparently \"coming soon.\"All in all it was a very pleasant and successful afternoon at Revolution. Although there were a couple of times where the service was slower than I would normally like (it did take a while for the food to come out), the staff was very friendly and helpful. And, I'm willing to write it off, being opening weekend, and all. And, by the time we left (well after 3 at that point), the place was getting jammed...We were both impressed enough with everything to join the mug-club, which ensures our return in the hopefully near future.

The hombre and farm burgers are pretty yummy, the side salad I got was surprisingly good (didn't look like salad mix out of a bag! cool!), and I got a bite or two of the amazing mashed potatoes....mmmmmm....I've liked every beer I've tried here, and the chalkboard drawing of the featured beer is way better than the bizarre art they often choose to display in the dining room. Recent favorite: God of War (both the beer and the chalkboard art!)Yeah, it's nuts how crowded it gets, but it's a popular place, so plan accordingly, I guess. Four of us came the Wednesday of the Big Ol' Blizzard and were told there was a 45-min wait, so we ordered beers at the bar, took a sip, and were whisked off to a table in probably just short of ten minutes. This has happened a couple of times, so maaaaybe they exaggerate the wait time. But why? Or to weed out those uncommitted to their dining experience? To separate the strong-willed from the ambivalent? In any case, the bar is really big so take a seat and enjoy a beer with your comrades as you wait. This brings me to my only complaint about this place so far: I despise a particular hostess. This person has been there I think every I've come, and she is obviously Too Cool For School. Each time it's the same; a real nasty attitude right from when we walk in the door, and she makes it clear we are obviously a great inconvenience to her. I've been a hostess, a server, and a food runner, (also did retail and I'm a hairstylist, so I really do understand the trials and tribulations of the service industry) and I know busy restaurants can grate the nerves, but man up and deal with it. That first interaction really sets up whether or not someone has a good or bad impression of the place. Also, wearing sunglasses indoors is lame. Unless she has some kind of light sensitivity problem, in which case, I apologize for the previous comment. \u00a0Fortunately, each server I've had has been really great, particularly the last guy.

Been to and/or toured all the big ones in the area (Bell's, 3Floyd's, Goose, Piece, Flossmore Station, etc), and many others around the country. Dabbled in homebrewing, been to brewmaster dinners, beer festivals, blah blah blah. You get the picture - beer dorks. So we have high expectations when it comes to brewpubs. It's not enough to just \"brew your own beer\" - it has to actually taste good. Revolution has got the goods, believe me. On our third visit (they've only been open for 11 days or so), they had 6 of their own beers and 8 guest beers on draught (including a badass \"Grober Kurfurst\" Dunkel by 3 Floyd's that you can't even buy in bottles, anywhere). But let's talk about the house brews, shall we? Cross of Gold and Workingman's Mild are lacking personality but very drinkable and not bad by any means (great if you don't prefer more intense beers). The Iron Fist Pale Ale is a great balanced american pale ale, for fans of Sierra Nevada and the such, good stuff. Their Porter is called Eugene and it's a great example of the style. Dark, roasty, chocolatey, and strong. The two newest additions to the lineup (they had just the previous 4 beers on tap when they opened) are the extremely tasty Bottom's Up Belgian Wit and the hopped up Anti Hero IPA. The Anti Hero IPA (as my wife immediately pointed out) tastes almost identical to Goose Island's IPA. Which isn't a bad thing. It's a perfect IPA and they serve it in the perfect glass - a tulip (but it really does taste exactly like Goose's famous IPA). The Bottom's Up Wit is also a top notch brew. If you like Allagash White and Bell's Winter White (or Hoegarden, Blue Moon, etc), you'll REALLY dig this Wit. It's has much more personality/balls than most popular Wit's out there. Favorites/standouts are Eugene, Anti Hero, and Bottom's Up. Join the mug club and you get to drink from some serious hardware, plus you get discounts on merch and growlers. And a cool membership card and a secret decoder ring. Ok fine you don't get a decoder ring. Oh and did I mention they have 30+ beers in cans/bottles as well? The food is also top notch. The Carolina style BBQ pulled pork sandwich is my favorite so far. They make/bake all their own breads and they get their pork from some very nice farmers (check revbrew.com for details). The mussels and pizzas are also good. The beer alone is worth the trip (many of the brews are just as good or better than Piece/Goose/etc), but the food is icing on the cake. Eat, drink, and be merry.The brewpub is well designed. Great 360 degree bar with \"fist\" columns. Communism theme actually works well (doesn't just sound good on paper, zing). Fireplace is a nice touch, and great use of barrels in the decor. Lighting is good and the window into the brewery is key (every brewpub's gotta have a nice view of the fermentation vessels for you while you drink the finished product). Also love how the kitchen is situated, and love the Xcelerator hand dryers in the washrooms. Ice in the urinals would bump my review up from 4 stars to 5 \u00a0 =) \u00a0Well, that and the service needs a small step up. If I want servers that don't check back on me and are too cool for school, I'll go down the block to Rocking Horse. I also heard they plan to open up a party room on the 2nd floor by next year.We live less than 1/2 mile away so I'm sure we'll be regulars (the wife and I both joined the Mug Club), but even if you don't live nearby - if you dig craft beers and good eats, you should probably come check this place out.

As in the food options they offered were kinky and interesting. And they have some kinks to work out with service and quality.Let me explain.First, the owners of Handlebar decided to open a brew pub, but went more upscale then its sister restaurant. The overall decor of the place is gorgeous. Artistic and well thought out, the flow of the place is great and there is a big, welcoming bar in the middle of the room. It connotes a higher end brew pub feeling, without being pretentious or under serving of the locals. However, while their constructivism logo is good(fist pump!), the color and the font don't fit in with the place. This is a small detail, but made bigger by the fact that they provide the menu with the typeface spilled directly across the top, on these over-sized, laminated paper that belong more at a chain like Fudruckers then a classy brew pub. Kinky.Second, the beer is good, not great as many people have noted in their reviews, but still unconventionally interesting. I sampled almost all of them and thought the Wit and the Iron fist was good, but nothing to write home about. Conversely though, the Willie was incredibly delish and aromatic. It also went well with the beingets for desert, since it had a nice smoky flavor. Who knew a beer could be smoky? And, their cocktails were good. The Manhattan with whiskey cherries and liquor was great. Third, food was good as well, and also had some striking options: Bacon Fat popcorn? Sounds awesome. But we stuck with the PEI mussels with white ale and shallots which was probably the best dish I had there. Next time, going for the mussels with hard cider and blue cheese. The roasted beet and feta salad was large and a fair price at $9, and easily enough to share, but I felt like the romaine lettuce, since it isn't in season, was too light. It would have been better placed with spinach, even a little bit, to even out the taste and color combination. Also, too many onions that left you with a sharp taste in your mouth for the rest of the night. The fish and chips were real good! They served it in a basket with chips underneath, and honey jalapeno slaw and roasted red pepper remoulade, which was great for dipping the fries in. Oh, and the newspaper they used for the basket to catch the oil? The Onion of course. Brilliant.And for desert, as I already mentioned were beingets and a mocha nip. I thought that it was only going to be 4, but it ended up at 8 pieces. They were fried a little too much. Not like the light and fluffy beignets I remember from New Orleans, but hard and dense. Kinky again.Finally, service was...eh. We sat at the bar and there were 3 tenders on all night, but there were many times that we had to flag someone down for water, or to order drinks. They weren't very attentive, and they weren't crazy busy either. Kinky.Overall, 3 stars. The place is nice, and the price points are high enough to keep the waning hipsters out and allow this place to become a nice establishment. I hope the hype they have received lately hasn't gone to their head and they will actually make some positive changes that will surely keep their customers coming back.

Love the interior decoration and the space Revolution is in. It was roomy enough to accommodate the true crush of people there when I visited. Also, the food is yummy (I had the Workingman's Burger and it was a welcome treat after the wait). The bad: The staff seemed completely overwhelmed and really mishandled our party. Here's what happened: We went at 6:30 on a Saturday (which, admittedly, is going to be among the busiest times at a place like this). We were told an hour wait for a party of 4. To be expected. We put our names on the list and grabbed beers. I had the Wit to start with and it was decent. An hour into our wait we checked our status and there were still 8 (!) parties ahead of us. At that point it became clear that they had underestimated our wait. Badly. We ended up waiting a total of 2 hours to spend about 40 minutes eating our meal. The absolute worst part was that the hostess promised us the next available four-top and then the managers went over her head and seated another party in front of us. It was rude and while the hostess was apologetic, the managers seemed only falsely friendly. We had ceased being customers and were just part of the problem - they were too busy.Bottom line: Decent beer and good food, but nothing so amazing that I would want to wait 2 hours for it. I was pretty disappointed and I won't be going back. If you want to go, don't go at a peak time. I'd recommend waiting a few months until the hype dies off. Suggested improvements: Currently, they seat incomplete parties and allow add-ons to tables. They need to stop that ASAP. It slows down the service and is frustrating to watch as a customer with a complete party waiting to be seated. Caveats:I don't live in the neighborhood so my review should be read as one who has to travel to get to Revolution. If this place were within walking distance of my house, I might feel better about the whole experience I had there. But traveling for a meal and then experiencing poor service is a real downer.

The Cross of Gold is my favorite so far, but I haven't made it in to try the Wit, which will hopefully surpass it. The Gold is just a well textured beer with a great flavor profile. Refreshing and num num. The porter could use a little more body, in my humblest opinion. The Workingma's Mild has great caramel tones and is a close second to the Golden. The Pale Ale tastes a bit hoppy for me, and the IPA has great aromatic hops and isn't too bitter, which I like cuz hoppy beers are a bit played out in my mouth.Second, the food. OMFG. A gastropub with V items on the menu. Thank you RBC for answering my biggest wish. The reuben holds up to even the Chicago Diner's--as much as I hate to say that. You're fries are super num num. Crunchy and well seasoned in a nice portion. Presentation doesn't hurt either.Ambience is super classy. The open air feel of the place is wonderful, and what a bar you all have.

Great burgers, though I mostly stick to the Crispy Pork Belly and Egg Sandwich. I'm not a big sausage guy, but their Jagerwurst was amazing. Don't overlook their pizza either. It's all hand-tossed and made in a hearth oven. The Twice Baked Potato and Giardinera Pizzas were very impressive. Theirs beers are great as well-- good mix of craft seasonal and regulars. There's also a great selection of guest beers (bottled and draft). I believe they don't have a single domestic light beer. They are canned and bottled now too.

Not a big fan of random people walking around my table at all!b) I didn't like the beer. \u00a0Given, I am not a beer connoisseur, but between 3 of us tasting 5 beers there SHOULD have been one that I wouldn't mind drinking.. Actually when we left 2 of the glasses were barely touched after the initial tasting. \u00a0 c) The food we ordered missed the mark.. Scratch that, it missed the wall the the dartboard was on. \u00a0I split two of the dishes with my sister (the Tempeh Rubin and the Goat Cheese Croquette Salad) and my husband had a burger of some sort. \u00a0-The Goat Cheese croquettes were awesome, but there was a whole salad that was to be eaten along with it. \u00a0The problem with the salad was the dressing. \u00a0It tasted really good as soon as the food touched your tongue, but as you started to chew it all the flavor disappeared! \u00a0I know it sounds crazy, but when I told my sister she agreed that it was the weirdest phenomenon . \u00a0Maybe the salad needs less oil or something.. it really was a pity. \u00a0- I was soo stoked about the tempeh rubin being on the menu. \u00a0Since I stopped eating meat I kinda missed this dish as one of those meals that you think you can never have again. \u00a0It wasn't completely awful, but I'm not craving it. \u00a0It was really messy and better when eaten with a fork, but the texture of the tempeh was a little too crunchy. \u00a0We were kinda put off by it.-The Burger: \u00a0My husband ordered well done, it came medium rare. \u00a0He is grossed out by undercooked burgers. \u00a0Yeah, I know that it's organic meat and such, but meat is meat when it comes to bacteria that might get on it. The staff was awesome about handling the problem, and they just took the item off the bill (and I read other reviews about how they say they will take it off and they don't, we didn't have that problem). \u00a0But from the couple bites he did eat, my man was pretty sick the next day. \u00a0An inside source (we know someone that works there) said that the guy that makes the burgers REFUSES to cook them well done- FYI.-Beignets & Mocha for dessert was a total let down. \u00a0I didn't expect Cafe du Monde, but they were really dry and lacked all flavor, even when dipped in the chocolate. \u00a0 Skip it all together, you will be disappointed if you order them. Yet when all was said and done I didn't feel like I was ripped off, so I guess the pricing was really good. \u00a0I really hope this place is able to shape up. \u00a0When I tell people about this place, I warn them about the food, but I sing praises about the service.

It opened to crush attendance.I elected to wait for subsidation of the crowds in order to give the venue a better chance at making a solid impression. My first visit was on a Thursday night. It took 30 minutes for me to be served due to the crowd. I wound up having two beers in a little over 70 minutes, at which point I decided to escape to Quenchers further east on Fullerton (I was on a CTA 1-day pass.). The India Pale Ale is a good one. It isn't hopped up the wazoo like many American Pale Ales. But my favorite is still the Porter. The dark malts prevail in the taste over the hops. It does cost one dollar more than the other beers, probably due to the malt bill.The motif of the venue angles toward radical, \"wobbly\" politics.

It is not overt.This brewpub shall energize the entire neighborhood, from Ronny's on the south to the Two-Way Lounge on the north.

The service was OK, not the best, not the worst. Overall, a middle of the road experience.

Visual Aesthetic: The setting is very cool. Feels a little like a traditional pup with the darkness of the wood and \"brick\" accent room divider things, but it's so wide open a \"airy\" you don't feel in a dungeon. The \"chandelier\" thing by the front door is neat--made of these brown glass flask things all grouped together. \u00a0The rest of the lights are these funky things that tie some black above with the black/dark brick things below. \u00a0The bar, in the center of the main room, is specially designed, as evidenced by the Revolution hand logo seemingly holding up the top part of the bar. Also, above the TV is a Revolution Brewing Co. sign. Very cool. They have many of their own beers on tap (duh!) and some other \"guests\" as well. \u00a0The bar stools are comfy. \u00a0The brew space is connected to the main dining area with glass for all to see. The kitchen is open to the main dining area but is clean, bright (glistening silver metal appliances and wall back-splashes), and not at all a chaotic and noisy distraction. \u00a0On an early Sunday afternoon there is a mix of young friends coming for the brunch and bloody mary's, as well as families with young kids. \u00a0A good vibe all around.The Food: The good stuff. I had the Cremini Mushroom pizza. It's a thin crust brick oven style personal size pizza. SOOOOOOO friggin good. It was a white pizza with goat cheese b\u00e9chamel, tarragon, truffle oil, and a butt-ton of mushrooms. Not everyone's cup of tea, but Yum! The girl next to me had a traditional cheese with sausage. It looked good too. My boyfriend had the Smokehouse Burger which comes with Pepper jack, and South Carolina-style pulled pork, and he got the blue cheese potato salad on the side. Burger was HUGE, and cooked exactly the way he wanted it. The pulled pork had a good-flavored sauce with the right amount of \"zing\" to it. The potato salad was to die for. The beer: I had Revolution's Workingman's Mild, a very good, drinkable session-style beer. Boyfriend had the Iron Fist Pale Ale and the Hombre, an American pale ale. They were solid, quality beers. An additional bonus... don't know who chooses the music that gets played for diners/drinkers, but while I was there Sunny Day Real Estate came on. I've never heard this band's music played in a public place such as a restaurant, or even this type of bar. It's a nice bonus and a comfort that someone at the establishment has good taste in music. \u00a0:)", "Date": "2010-08-22", "Author_Location": "Ann Arbor, MI"}, {"Author": "Bobby K.", "ReviewID": "SbJXpZZyS4n86ganR0lHXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Superb. \u00a0I'm a big brewpub fan and this one has never disappointed. \u00a0The menu is seasonal and has changed by the next time I return. \u00a0Have yet to try the pizza but every other entree I've had has been excellent. \u00a0Prices are a bit higher than the competition, but Revolution makes it a point to note the quality of their ingredients which more than justifies the price. \u00a0The beer is lovely, more experimental and seasonal than Piece in my opinion. \u00a0I'm rarely out in Logan Square but this is a worthy of \"destination spot\" classification for sure.", "Date": "2010-10-10", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Rina Y.", "ReviewID": "Nq3f8aNpYBjghXBQV-AT3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My family and I wanted to eat something other than Christmas dinner leftovers on 12.26 so we went in search of an open restaurant. \u00a0We just happened to be driving down Milwaukee when all of a sudden I saw the sign and yelled \"Stop! \u00a0We're gonna try Revolution tonight!\" \u00a0We were doing an earlier dinner (6 pm) and it's the day after Christmas so we were super lucky to have no wait but there was definitely a wait within 5 minutes of us sitting down. \u00a0Had a good vibe - neighborhood people just enjoying general holiday merriment with friends and family - and felt super cozy right when you walk in (prolly because of the fireplace) We tried the Cross of Gold (prolly their most middle of the road beer), Bottoms Up (wheat beer) and the Fistmas Ale (the seasonal ale). \u00a0All had its own distinct and fabulous taste and even my mom, who does not drink more than a sip of any alcohol at a sitting, was definitely asking for \"another tasting\" of all of them. \u00a0The food was actually what was more impressive. \u00a0Since we'd been eating and laying around all weekend (the way to really do the holidays) we weren't starving so we shared the steamed mussel appetizer (the white ale, celery, shallot kind - super fresh mussels and amazing broth), charcuterie platter ( when we went it was all house made kielbasa, jalapeno sausage, super thinly sliced pork tenderloin, and pork rillet with a strawberry and blueberry compote, all served with a few slices of dark rye bread - all of it was soooo good and we were even raving about the mustard on the side!), the apple pork pizza (not awesome but not bad either - a bit bland and could use some color - maybe throw an arugula salad on top of it?), and the forest burger (my sister is a super picky eater so this was her dish but of course I had to have a bite - delicious meat, she requested medium and it was cooked perfectly to specification, and fabulously creamy mashed potato as a side). \u00a0Making mom, dad, and sister happy is always tough but this place left all of us super happy and full.", "Date": "2010-12-27", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Christa R.", "ReviewID": "PuMzoaQ887si2o_n-825tw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yum, yum gimme some.

Here's the visit. Ambience: The decor is great. Kinda rustic and hip. Loved the portraits hanging on the wall of distinguished fictional celebrities like Frankstein's Monster and Richie Tenebaums. Very warm and comfortable. Even though they did have double doors a draft would get in every now and then that affected my wife, but for me it was no biggie. Yes. They did have some televisions showing Sunday Night Football, which I liked, but it was easily ignored if one wished to and it didn't hinder the enjoyment of the nice atmosphere. The Service: I was warned by Yelp to expect not to be seated until our full party had arrived so when the hostess asked us to sit at the bar to wait for the rest of our group I was fine. I chatted with the friendly bartender about their homebrews and even though she pretty much told me \"everything is good\", which isn't what I wanted, I orderd their Bottom Up Wit to start things off. Good. Light. A little hoppy with a citrus finish. I could drink several of these. Our server Katie was fine. The restaurant was pretty much full and she had no problem checking up on us throughout the night and making sure we were content. Though there was a mix up on our bill that took some time to get remedied, she handled it fine and there was no drama. But oddly, like the bartender, she didn't really have an opinion on the food and drink when we were ordering. She went with the \"everything is good\" route as well. Maybe it's restaurant policy that employees must say that everything is good but I just wanted some opinions straight from the horses mouth especially since the restuarant is new to me. Oh well. Maybe everything is good. Or. Maybe not. The Food: I might be becoming a wing snob because even though their wings had good flavor and some good blue cheese sauce for dipping, I just wasn't crazy about them and probably wouldn't order them again. I think for the most part it was the texture. The wing was limp, not soggy or undercooked, but it just didn't have any real bite to it. The wing, though tasty, kind of seemed liked they were microwaved instead of fried. The blue cheese potato salad, that a co-worker of mine raved about, tasted like a blan potato salad and nothing special whatsoever. I didn't even taste any blue cheese. Kind of sad. My other appetizer I tried was the popcorn. Now I read a review that said that it was something I could have made at home and that it was medicore, but I'll disagree. The popcorn was great. A salty snack with just the right amount of bacon and thinly grated cheese that went awesome with my brew. Simple ingredients and certainly something worth spending $4 on. My Workingman Burger at first glance seemed like a clear winner. Large burger with onions, cheese, and bacon on a nice bun. What could go wrong? Well, for the most part it doesn't come with any sauce. Not that no sauce was the nail in the coffin for me but sauces are wonderful. Why not have one? So I took a bite of my big burger that I applied ketchup to and a few things hit me. Good bun. Great onions. Crispy bacon. So-so beef patty. Even though the beef was juicy and thick and looked wonderful, there wasn't much flavor to the meat and alas toppings can carry a burger only so far and I struggled towards the end to finish the thing. It was probably the beer talking but I ordered their Cinnamon Roll for a little dessert. Homemade Cinnamon Roll with bacon baked inside. Sounded awesome. I like bacon. Sadly the Cinnamon Roll tasted like it came from a grocery store and the bacon bites, though adding some fun and flavor, couldn't save the treat. Very passable. Beer: Clearly the winner here is the alcohol. Out of the homebrews I tried, the Coming Up Wit and Fistmas, were my favorite. Even though I'm not a huge pale ale fan the Fistmas had just the right amount of hoppiness to me and was quite good making me prefer it over the other IPA I tried, their Anti-Hero. If one doesn't want to go the homebrew way then they have a rotating selection of guest draft beers on tap and a pretty big bottled beer list. Win win.Conclusion: It's good. I would come back. There are plenty of positives here. But I wasn't wowed like i wanted to be and if I was forced to choose between Revolution or Haymarket I would have to go with Haymarket.

BUT... It can be drank at this Logan Square venue. I have been one of the thousands waiting for this future staple to finally open. Doubtful, Chicago would let it ever open, but even Daley could not hold back the Revolution any longer. First, anyone who complains about the wait last night is obtuse and naive. Last night was the soft launch, and the rumblings and excitement of this place's opening would have tipped you off the opening was going to be extremely busy and have some kinks. Also, Logan Square, has been screaming for a landmark venue to open here like Revolution. To fairly review this amazing venue properly you must remove the element of extreme anticipation, and visualize what the venue will be like, when the initial excitement dies down. The decor is OUTSTANDING! Not one detail was over looked. Exposed brick, hand-carved wood fists, and tin designed ceilings look amazing. The waiting area in the front, has barrels cut in half as tables and also dawns a very hip fireplace, similar to high end ski lodges you find in Vail and Aspen. There are some interesting looking VIP type booths near the kitchen as well. Basically it is 2-3 booths that are tall leather seats that seat about 8 people, but do not have a table. I dug these areas. It is a great seating idea so friends and keep everybody engaged, and not divided. I hope these sections are permanent. It is very hip and trendy, but not too cliche'. Also, the kitchen is a prominent feature. Many places hide the kitchen away to conceal mess, but Revolution fearlessly exposes its glimmering steel and high flaming ovens for all to see. \u00a0Finally, the pride of this establishment is also within view of its customers, the brewery. Four large tanks stand against the inside wall probably full of wort waiting to fully mature for our palates to enjoy.Next is the food. I was not able to order the bacon fat popcorn appetizer, it will be on my plate the next time I visit however. Sounds unique and needs to be sampled at least once. Does bacon make anything taste bad? \u00a0The food appears to be a bit pricey for Logan Square, but after eating there, the price is a deal for the quality and portions. Packed to the gills, and with orders coming in at full pace, the quality of the food I ate did not suffer from the overworked kitchen. I had the Forest Burger (Gorgonzola, cremni mushroom and crispy shallot, $12). I ordered it medium rare, it was cooked perfectly. The beef is farm raised and the burger is HUGE! It must be 2/3s to a pound, no joke. The cheese, bun and shallot went well together and the beef was juicy and flavorful. My wife had the Cremini Mushroom Pizza ($12). \u00a0For some reason we were in the mood for mushrooms. We tend to have a weakness for anything \"truffle\" on an item. The pizza has goat cheese b\u00e9chamel, tarragon, and truffle oil. It comes looking and tasting like a wood burnt pizza and is priced well considering it contains truffle oil. \u00a0I recommend both. Now to wash it down...Okay, here is the pride of Revolution... THE BEER. I was able to try all 5 of the handcrafted beers Revolution offers. The first was my wife's favorite, \"Cross of Gold\". This is a golden ale that is the closet to a pilsner wth a sweet bitter finish (I am aware of the oxymoron here). Next, I had the Iron Fist Pale Ale (IPA). I liked the hop taste, but it is not in your face hops like an Alpha King. However, I would order it again and did enjoy it. The Workingman Mild is actually very filling for only 3.5% alcohol. Most lower gravity beers are watery, but this one was not at all. I had another ale, but the name slips me. It was a good beer, but nothing flashy. Finally, I had the porter -Eugene. I am not a fan of Porters, but ironically this one was my favorite. The dark beer has a hint of coffee taste from the chocolate malt and is very smooth. It has made me think twice about porter style beer. I guess that is the point of Revolution. Each was $5, except the porter ($6), but I think that is reasonable for beer that literally moves about 50ft. from where it was born. I do need to keep in mind this is the first batch, and the beer will only get better from here on out.Although I do give five stars, I was disappointed there was no wheat beer (normally a summer beer, I know), but the fresh beers on tap should have something for everyone and I think one is brewing. Could be more room around the bar, I see that area being tight even after the initial buzz dies down. It might be pricey for Logan Square. Hopefully, outsiders will make up the gap though. Strong recommendation and a must visit. \u00a0I will be back soon...ALSO, join the mug club... great deal there too.", "Date": "2010-02-04", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Mark R.", "ReviewID": "ETQkA0krai5VG_zorC0URg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Stopped in Sunday for lunch.

Fish and chips a big hit, too - although lemon wedges would have been better than the slices we were served. Loved the coleslaw! The fries in both orders were superb.

That's right: I HAD MEAT AS A TOPPING ON MY BURGER. \u00a0It was as good as you can imagine. \u00a0My friend had their Farm Burger, which had an egg fried to perfection with a creamy house horseraddish sauce that made a spicy heat that amplified the beef's natural savor without drowning it in the horseraddish flavor.Second, I've been a fan of their beers for a long time, but nothing beats having a solid stout in the winter that almost had a mocha-like quality to it. \u00a0It was all the chocolate flavor of a hot chocolate without the sickening sweetness. \u00a0Delicious.Third the atmosphere is that of your typical hipster gastropub (some of you are on high alert now if you've read my other reviews; it's coming). \u00a0It's clean, with your stereotypical faux industrial with wood overlain. \u00a0Very 2010's as a style.Finally, we get to service. \u00a0Our table was fine, but the problem was we started at the bar with tall Hipster Jesus. \u00a0This guy is the worst bartender in the City of Chicago. \u00a0First of all, his half-sleeved arm tatoos tell me I'm potentially getting side of hepetitis with my beer while his half-assed work ethic says, \"I have a trust fund and only took this job to fit in with my hipster friends....and I voted for Romney.\" \u00a0I was there for 10 minutes before I gave up and just resolved to wait another 5 minutes for the table without a nice Revolution Beer. \u00a0This jerk went over and proceeded to chat with his friends and check on all his other customers, despite a clearly raised index finger and clearly audible \"Bartender\" from me. \u00a0Even $$ didn't motivate this college drop-out to come and serve me. \u00a0(I felt like an ass pulling out that $20, but nothing else worked.) \u00a0He's probably someplace now talking about the irony of them having a TV in the bar but never turning it on while spraying some Axe body spray to go double-pits-to-chesty.So, my friends, I impart upon you a colloquialism: Never Tip Hipster Jesus at Revolution.Otherwise, the place is awesome. \u00a0I'll be back, and I'll continue to drink their beer wherever...provided Hipster Jesus isn't to busy crushing it instead of doing his job.", "Date": "2013-02-16", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Diego G.", "ReviewID": "IWcIeEe15yVaqdt6i4IzTw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT go to Revolution.

First time I walked in for Lunch during the week and the bar had probably a total of 6-8 people in the entire place and was fully staffed. Ordered an appetizer from the bar and took it to our table where our server took our lunch order along with the drink order. Long story short, We finished our appetizer and received our entrees before we even got a glass of water let alone our first and only order of beers. Now it would be totally different if the place was packed and the server was \"in the weeds\", however it doesn't help the servers reasons when he is parked at the host stand the entire time we were there. Hey off day no biggie right....WRONG! Next time I go in is with my uncles on a Friday night. My uncle orders a Stoli & 7up, observes the Lady Bartender pour a one second pour and water the rest down with soda. After trying the drink he informs the bartender that he tastes no alcohol in the drink. The bartender proceeds to grab a straw and taste the drink herself and and agrees, has the bar manager taste the drink and he agrees. They state the obvious to my uncle and tell him that it must be the soda. DUH! So my Uncle asks if they can top it off with another shot of stoli please. NO ONE SHOULD pay 8 dollars for SODA POP. So as the bartender is pouring the drink, she looks dead in my uncle's eyes and says and I quote \" maybe you can't taste the alcohol because you've been drinking all day long.\" What the hell kinda of service is that? And the last and final experience comes from this past Sat night. My other uncle stops in after work for a couple rounds of the beer flights they have with some buddies. He buys the first, friend buys the second, other friend buys the third round. So on the 4th round of these beer shots he orders and is served. He hands the bartender a 20$ oh and let me point out that this is the same young lady that made the inappropriate comment to my other uncle. The bill is 9$ so they are about to close and my uncle states to the barkeep that he never received his change from the last round he bought. She tells him \"oh I don't even remember you paying for those drinks.\" There is no way she could have thought that the 11$ due back was hers because the party was paying for each round individually with tip. He and his party weren't even able to finish that round. We only live a block away from this establishment and had such high hopes but it turns out to be the biggest letdown since the BARTMAN scandal at Wrigley!

I signed up to become a member of the Party a couple of weeks ago. I figured since I'll be moving into the 'hood soon, I might as well spend the extra dough for the first growler and reap the year-long benefits later. Last night, was my first experience with the food. So let's do this in two parts: the beer, and the food. The beer (the good): No serious complaints here. Is it the best beer in the world? No. Does it beat the offerings from Peace and Half Acre (my other two grower refill locations of choice)? Certainly. So far I've had four of their beers: The Workingwoman brown ale, the Anti-Hero IPA, and a heavy triple ipa and another liter lager-body beer whose names I currently forget. The Workingwoman was a little disappointing. Should have gone for the the Workingman, more than likely. It was a little soapy for my taste. And the perfume? It smelled like the glass was not washed all the way. Smelled like old food and dishwater than an Eau de Toilette. The Anti-Hero IPA was much better. Though the other IPA's hops had an almost grapefruit tartness, this one was much more mild, and a much better paring with most food. The bad (the food): I have to say, the menu here looks delicious. But the end results? Very disappointing. A friend and I split: Bacon Popcorn; the beet, mushroom, and duck bruschetta; the special pizza: bacon, pea puree, goat cheese, basil, and egg; and the pork chop with mushrooms, gravy, and cranberry (sauce?). Everything looked great. Reality, however, was much more disappointing. Our bruschetta was, by far, the best part of our meal, especially the beet with onion and goat cheese. Perfect. What I was most excited about was one of the biggest failures. When I heard about bacon fat cooked popcorn with parmesan cheese, I said \"Sign me up!\" However this seemed more like an awful stoner snack gone institutional. The bacon fat made the popcorn chewy. Along with the chewiness of the bacon and the half melted cheese, a bite became a chewy mess in my mouth. Even worse were the entrees. The pizza had a soggy crust, the ingredients didn't come together like I thought they would, and the egg was totally overcooked. I'm a HUGE fan of a sunny-side up egg on pizza, because the runny yolk can be cracked and spread 'round the pizza. This one was totally overcooked. And the pork? Almost every element was oversalted. The meat was cooked to perfection! But you could barely taste the character of the meat because of all the salt.The Ugly: Two beers, two apps, two entrees: $75 without tip. Wow. Wayyyy too much. Especially for totally uninspired food. I feel like the chefs here are not doing the food justice. I totally support creative cooking, and will always endure a miss as long as the cooks do their part to execute it well. However, I feel like a soggy crust and \u00a0completely oversalted pork are two things I cannot forgive. I'll keep coming here for the beer, and maybe some finger food.

I'll admit, I wasn't a huge fan of the Workingman Burger.

The guy I placed my order with said it is meant to be a subtle beer that is best suited for drinking while eating. He was right. It's a 3.5% abv, light, has a great subtle taste, and did complement the food wonderfully. And, with take out, they have growlers of beer available for purchase. Which is kind of awesome. And you can get it refilled for cheaper if you keep the growler. I will be going back for more Workingman beer. Annnd my boyfriend ate everything on his plate.
