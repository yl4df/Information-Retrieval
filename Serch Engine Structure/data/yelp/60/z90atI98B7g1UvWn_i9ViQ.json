If you're interested in the deep dish pizza, let the maitre d know because it will take a minimum of 45 minutes to bake.Tables are very small and quaint. They will place a TV tray by your table to accommodate the pizza.Service - they are on it! Drinks were constantly being refilled, and with a friendly smile. Large deep dish pizza - it feeds about 4-6 people. I love the flexibility to customize the order. The maitre d recommended to keep it simple. Decided to go with pepperoni, mushrooms, and roasted garlic. The pizza arrived piping hot. The crust wasn't soggy like other Chicago-style pizzas. It was crispy. There was a perfect portion of tomato sauce and cheese. It was so gooey and delicious.Bread pudding - I usually go with the tiramisu but after reading all the rave reviews on the bread pudding, I knew I couldn't pass it up. From the photos, I had the impression that it was going to be small. I was wrong. It was huge! About the size of a deep dish pizza slice, but thicker. It wasn't just dipped in egg, it was coated in custard. Mouth waveringly delicious. It was warm, and the sweetness was not overwhelming.", "Date": "2014-07-15", "Author_Location": "Granada Hills, CA"}, {"Author": "nick g.", "ReviewID": "tYQ6R8mM3GJy6iew4UxZww", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "oh delicious calories, how I both love and loathe you.The food was 4 stars, but the good service bumped it up.

I appreciated his hospitality but told him it was okay.Then later the hostess herself came to apologize and they ended up taking a salad we had ordered off the tab.The customer service/hospitality of the staff/owner here are top notch and just wanted to write them a nice review.Pizza is top notch as well as service.

I'll explain the 7 in a bit...Number of visits: 1 (many more to come...)Would I come back? Hell effing YEAH!WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS JUST FOR THE BREAD PUDDING and the description of this experience may not be suitable for young children...A few of my friends had already recommended this place to me in the past. I've had several conversations with people about how good it was and that it was a must try. The final push was made by Carolyn C. after we briefly discussed my disappointment with bread pudding I had tried somewhere else. She was supposed to join us in this venture but couldn't make it. Instead I was able to experience this with Joseph A., Stephanie P, James B and Yuri K. We had just finished dinner at another location and this was the planned itinerary for dessert. I had high expectations, I didn't want to be let down...Upon getting seated we saw that there were several dessert options. We knew we wanted bread pudding, but figured since we were there, we might want to try another one too. When we asked the server what dessert she recommended, Bread Pudding was said before we even completed the question. Then I asked, \"What's the second best,\" and her response was, \"Bread Pudding.\" Clearly...Bread Pudding was a hit here. Still, we opted to go for the Chocolate Creme Brulee as well... When the desserts arrived and pictures were taken...we dove in....OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG....At first bite I think my first reaction were eyes wide open as I stared at Joseph A who sat across from me while I chanted \"oh my gosh\" over and over as I feared I would scream for joy out of the goodness that just entered my mouth! I clenched on to my fork for dear life hoping I could contain myself as my heartbeat raced so fast! \u00a0Yeah...THAT GOOD! Move over Ramekin bread pudding...you've been replaced! The bar has been re-calibrated to a higher standard! I don't even know how to explain it...All I know is that it's made with chocolate butter almond croissants baked in vanilla custard and drizzled with warm caramel sauce. It's so warm, moist, chocolatey and gooey as it hits your mouth that as soon as your taste buds realize what it's been hit with, you're mmm-ing all over the place! It was so good, I scraped as much as I could off of the plate. Heck even Stephanie P. had to remind me about the chocolate creme brulee I completely forgot about!Have you ever watched that Friends episode where Monica explains to Chandler the 7 different \u00a0erogenous zones and numbers them so she could describe the order of operations? \u00a0I felt like numbers 1, 2, 3 were the recommendations, the discussions and the foodporn pics and 4, 5, 6 were ordering, waiting and the first look at the bread pudding. Because once I took a bite of that thing....it was like what Monica said 7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...hence the rating 7! I think that's the reason there's an \"Echo\" at the park near by....just sayin...So yeah you should try it! You WILL like it! And if you don't like it...we can't be friends.

Do not underestimate it. We learned this the hard way.Came here on a Friday night with my best friend around 8P. There was a wait, but they let you put orders in early if you're getting a pizza. They make it fresh so it takes about 45min. Looked at the menu outside and then told the hostess what we wanted: a large \"Lots of Meat\" deep dish pizza. I'm usually not a fan of deep dish, but since this is what they are known for, we gave it a shot. Her response was \"For two of you? It's really big.\" Yeah, we didn't care. Ordered it anyway. Got seated inside about 15min later, wait wasn't very long at all. It's a cute place-- very homey, hole-in-the-wall Italian bakery type setting. It was dark inside, tables had a candle-- there's also a couch-seating area for biggers parties. Waiter came around, asked what our order was. He then replied with \"Just for the two of you? There'll be leftovers.\" We still didn't believe it. Waiter brought over a huge loaf of bread and butter, it was basically their pizza dough but it was soft, really good. Then, the GIANT PIZZA arrived. Even the the guy who brought the pizza out kinda laughed at us. Had ONE slice, which was amazing, and could barely get down half of another slice. Really regretted eating a slice of the free bread. My friend ate 2 slices. The best part was the Italian sausage: it isn't the usual you would get, it's more crumbled all over the top of the pizza-- but that means you get it with every bite. Ended up taking over half home. Will definitely go back to try their other dishes.", "Date": "2014-07-09", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "vicky c.", "ReviewID": "lf1Rj0L4uGyVSKrKjE48wA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I come here for their deep dish pizza, and let me tell ya, it doesn't disappoint! The only disappointment is the 40-45 minute wait after you put in your order, so order it as quickly as you can and perhaps an appetizer if you are still hungry. We purposely go earlier so we aren't starving. The pizza we usually always get is the \"lots of meat\" and we get the small size for 2 people. We usually only get through half of the pizza and take the rest home. This time, we shared with friends and we tried their \"lots of cheese\" pizza and it was incredible delicious too. Here I thought I wouldn't like it as much because it didn't have any meat! The marinara in their pizza is perfect, not too tangy, and had nice chunky tomatoes in it also.

DeepDish. Pizza.Enough Said- but I'll say a bit more anyway.Found out about this place after the iconic vegan chef Isa Chandra Moskowitz instagrammed them. How had I been so near this location so many times, and never known?I made a point of visiting soon after that. I just got a pizza to go. I went in to place my order, and the girl who worked to-go orders was great with recommending \"less is more\" as far as deep dish toppings, especially for the first time. I'm so glad she did, because it came with perfect chunky tomatoes (the best) and generous marinara. Perfect as it was, along with lots of gooey vegan cheese. It's Teese, not Daiya, for any vegans wondering. Didn't used to like Teese, but the new recipe is great!!! Especially on this pizza! Texturally better than Daiya would've been here. Backing up though, I had a wait for my pizza, so walked around the neighborhood for while before coming back to get it. Turns out I had left my keys behind, which they had saved for me. I have a lot of geeky keychains, so when I returned, the to-go girl and I had a nice little chat about a little known and under-appreciated TV show, called Supernatural.

We picked up our pizzas and asked if we would be able to eat at the bar because we wanted to eat there and order drinks while we ate. The woman working told us that it was such a huge hassle.

I was brought to this restaurant by my best friend for the deep-dish pizza. I am a fan and wannabe connoisseur of thin-crust pizza, but not a thick crust Chicago pizza expert---I did try several deep dish pizzas in the heart of Chicago and loved it. Deep-dish pizza is almost as tricky as thin crust pizza. These pizzas can be too dry, bread-like, and the outer layer needs to be cooked crispy but not burnt or oily. The restaurant interior is quaint and wonderful, with Anthropologie like decor colors and a dimly lit area. It does get a little noisy but adds pleasantly to the overall energy and experience of the place. Pizza is all about the dough and when served, I personally found the pizza very bready and yeasty in flavor, but the outer shell was cooked to perfection. The heaviness of the bread and the endemic characteristic of deep-dish pizza was too overwhelming and extremely heavy for me. I felt like I just stuffed a loaf of wonder bread into my stomach. Its saving grace was the deliciousness of the sausage that had a moderate but present tone of anise, which made me want to eat it again and finally just picked incessantly at the sausage--I asked the waitress about the sausage on deep-dish pizza and she confirmed it's freshly made. The restaurant has its roots in baked goods and therefore I instinctually ordered the \"Bread Pudding\"--It was great, the heaviness of the bread matched so well with the delicious thick apple slices & cinnamon and frankly I would go back just for the bread pudding. Service and waiting times were excellent. Overall, since my Foreman grill can make pizza similar in taste with two slices of bread. I would call it bread-yeast pizza. The experience is worth the trip with your Anti-Atkins Delicious Bread Pudding--Amazing. If you want the sausage, sometimes you have to swallow the bread gravy.

This place was just so good that I've come out of my month-long hiatus from writing yelp reviews to write one just for them haha! I'm pretty sure this place has also converted me to become a deep-dish pizza lover. Thin crust? Pfft, that can barely handle all of that soul a deep dish pizza has(;After not being able to see the sold out XXYYXX show at the Echoplex, we decided to grab a quick bite to eat before heading back to USC. We ended up outside of Masa, which smelled tantalizing, so we quickly stepped inside and was seated right away. Our waiter was super awesome, and gave us great recommendations, which included their deep dish pizzas of course. However, to our disbelief, he informed us that the pizza was going 45 minutes to bake. But with a quick scroll through yelp reviews with patrons stressing how amazing the pizza was and how it was worth the wait, we decided to go ahead and order a Traditional Small, which features mushrooms and sausages, half just mushroom for ol' pescetarian me. We also decided to start off with their artichoke dip. The artichoke dip was yummy, chock full of goodies such as red peppers and spinach, served with their signature Cuban roll. But the pizza....omgoodness the pizza*___* When it came out, I thought, eh looks okay, bet it's soggy in the middle with all the toppings loaded on it. One bite later, and I was in pure bliss! It was neither soggy or just okay as I originally perceived it to be....but truly out of this world. I don't know how they do it, but the dough was sturdy enough to hold everything and the crust was just so deliciously flaky. I honestly think some magic was involved lol. My friend, who is not a fan of sausage at all, took an immediate liking to their sausage. All the ingredients were top quality, with a chunky tomato sauce and so much ooey gooey cheese and layers of toppings. We weren't able to finish the small, otherwise I would've gone ahead and ordered the bread pudding which looked epic haha! Throughout our meal, our waters were always filled and our genuinely super rad server was always making sure that we were happy with everything.

You know... When you get a \"made to order pizza\" with just a few toppings, the pizza goes from being 20.95 to over $30 after tax, which is really a big difference. \u00a0So...

I wasn't sure about this place as I didn't love Hollywood Pies and was starting to think that maybe I wasn't loving deep dish as much as I thought I did! Happily this is not the case! We went on a Wednesday afternoon (although on a day they were featured on Yelp). I guess it was pretty busy for the middle of the day but there is ample seating and space in the restaurant so it wasn't super packed! I was able to find parking up the street fairly quickly (free might I add!) so that was another plus, especially in such a busy area. The inside is certainly very eclectic. The tables all have mismatched tablecloths (like the plastic outdoor ones my mom would use on the patio as a kid) and the chairs are all totally different. There is also an area to the left of the entrance with some 70s style plastic tufted yellow couches and chairs arranged for a larger group in that modern-restaurant-couch-seating trend. It works though.The service was fast and friendly. They were up front with how long the deep dish pies take (45-60 mins) but they quickly brought out a huge bread roll - piping hot from the oven with a steak knife \"stabbed\" in the middle. The salted butter that accompanied it meshed well with the sweetness of the bread. Not the butter was anything special - it just paired surprisingly well since the bread was sweet! We each had a bowl of the potato leek soup, which is not a creamy soup at all. The potato is cut into larger chunks with the skins still on - which give the soup a very earthy taste. It was good but simple and not something that I would need to have again. We decided on the \"lots of meat\" pie since it included my pizza must have - pepperoni. It did take the 45-60 mins but it was certainly worth the wait. It was delicious! Okay so the pizza is constructed like this: sausage pieces on top, thick tomato layer, pepperoni layer, ooey-gooey cheese layer and thick crust bottom!Sausage: On the top of the sauce, \u00a0was an almost butterflied piece of sausage. The sausage was great - lots of fennel and sweet with a hint of spice but I'm just not a huge sausage on pizza person. It was an easy fix though - I just removed mine. That's not to say though that it wasn't good. It was a great sausage. Just I prefer mine without.Tomato Sauce: Tastes homemade. A really nice balance between sweet and tart. It was also a little bit chunky with hunks of stewed tomato. Yum! Pepperoni - Yum! Not much to say here. Slightly spicy. High quality. Good. Cheese - I was worried because at Hollywood Pies, I felt they skimped so much on the cheese. The waiter assured us there was plenty of cheese on this pizza - and he was absolutely right! Lots and lots of cheese right under the sauce! Made a girl very happy! The Crust - I think this is what this pie is all about! The crust! It's amazing! Thick! Crusty! Flaky! Buttery! And with a bit of sweetness! Actually, a lot of sweetness. It's a very sweet crust but it's not overly so and \u00a0balances so well with the tartness of the tomato sauce and toppings. I'm still amazed at how they got it so flaky and buttery! (And it didn't get the least bit soggy - and was so strong that it even held up for single handed pizza eating - and I'm talking about the leftovers!)It was an excellent meal! The guy actually sold us on a size down, we originally wanted to get the large for leftovers as well. We took two slices home (although I think I only ate 2! \"Pizza Bandit\" strikes again!) but the next time we go, I want more leftovers so I think a larger size is the way to go!

Our friends ordered the basket of mozzarella sticks and the deep dish with half pepperoni/sausage, half pepperoni/jalapenos. What I liked most about the pizza was it's uniqueness...the dough had a pastry-like buttery texture and appeared to be made from cornmeal. Very good. Each bite was satisfying and scrumptious. Not as filling as I thought it was gonna be but then again this was my cheat meal for the week so I guess all those calories I had been saving up for the week were more than I needed to make room for this. My friend's husband said it was one of the best pizzas he's ever tried...while my husband agreed the pizza was very good, he thought 'the best' was pushing it.

The slices are pretty solid, huge and filling. The crust is doughy thick from what I've had in the past, but it was super (hard) crunchy. The chi style pizza here is a lot more doughy than what I've had. It's not bad, I just have a different expectation for \"best\". The layer of crust at the bottom is decent and not as thin as I had expected. The tomato sauce on the pizza is sweet, almost reduced wine, herbal taste. I love it. It's absolutely addicting! I wish they were more generous with the mushrooms. The cheese is unbelievably cheesy. I mean string cheesy cheese ;)) I took half of the pizza home and reheated it in the oven a few days later.

Spots are numbered and you pay at the machine. Restaurant:Nice & cozy. Small, dim lit, and pretty loud. Didn't really understand the small baby TV in the corner hanging on the wall, but overall it was very casual. There's not a lot of seating for the parties waiting.

THE SERVICE:I was over at Raul's Auto Body & Repair, which was in Silver Lake, waiting to get work done on my car, so we called to phone in a delivery order. Although the place only delivers to Echo Park, they made an exception because we were merely one mile away off Sunset.We called around 1:30, and they quoted 1 hour to 1 hour 15, which was reasonable considering that the deep dish pizza itself takes 40ish minutes to bake anyway. I've heard that you have to wait just as long, if not longer, while dining in... just a heads up for those considering here for a quick lunch spot.The owner (the missus) hand delivered our pizza, and when she noticed the puppy running around the office, she said \"if I had known you had a dog, I would have brought a treat. I'll remember to bring him a treat next time!\" and then proceeded to note \"dog\" on the receipt she was bringing back to Masa. Then I handed her a tip, and she wouldn't take it! The nerve of her!THE FOOD:I've had Masa once before when Dao P. brought it over to a friend's apartment for us to try, and remembered savoring the first bite up to my last bite until we finished the pizza. I was a little obsessed to the point where I craved it minutes after finishing the deep-dish pizza made from crack, and the days following. This time, I ordered the small Traditional Deep Dish (small $15.95, large $20.95) and garlic bread ($5.95 for a loaf), and while I was nervous it wouldn't fill 3 people, my anxiety was clearly in vain. We were more than stuffed and bloated, AND we still had 2 extra slices of pizza that none of us could finish, not that we didn't want to. The ingredients on this pizza were just beyond words... the Italian sausage, mershrooms, smoked mozzarella, and fresh tomatoes (and possibly basil?) were so balanced in flavor that every bite was incredibly rich without any one ingredient being overbearing on the others. I could string as many words together to try describing it, but I highly recommend you taste this pizza for yourself. Also, if you're willing to stray from the signature, it's always fun to have the option to Build Your Own. I think I'm up for the challenge next time! :) Lastly, for those who aren't hip to pizza, there's a large (and neglected, likely) menu offering salads, crepes, paninis, burgers, and pastas.Solid service + fantastic food = 5 shiny, well-earned and deserved stars!", "Date": "2014-04-25", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Jessica B.", "ReviewID": "bFdngfdRH9Fjy9MqL5KF6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The most amazing deep dish pizza.

Usually, artichoke dip is mostly greasy cheese with a little bit of spinach and artichoke. This was super thick and chunky, with really large pieces of artichoke, and tons of spinach and red pepper.

Eight very nice size pieces. It was absolutely delicious! I don't like a lot of sauce on my pizza, and this seemed less like sauce and more like fresh, chopped tomatoes. The cheese was excellent, and the crust was exactly what I would expect from good, deep dish, Chicago style pizza. Nice and thin on the bottom, extra thick along the edge, rich and buttery, but not greasy in the least. The only thing I was sad about is that we were too full to try the bread pudding I've read so much about, but this just gives us an excuse to go back! Great service and very reasonable prices (with an iced tea and Coke, about $33) and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day.", "Date": "2014-06-26", "Author_Location": "Palmdale, CA"}, {"Author": "Chris C.", "ReviewID": "1ARw3gI-A_6OE2UqkJ6BAw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Masa of Echo Park is known for their deep dish pizza. That's where they get the very name for their eatery, as the \"masa\" is more commonly known as cornmeal dough. It gives the crust that corn bread-ish texture. I'm not really a huge fan of it, but it does make the pizza pie rather interesting due to that flaky and brittle composition. It's almost like eating a biscuit, but tends to imitate an extremely soft cookie.Even though you're not a fan of Chicago style deep dish pizza, it's one of those things to add to your bucket list. My mission is to frequent the top places in SoCal and try to find that ultimate one. That way, if someone asks, I would be like - \"Yeah, I know the best place for Deep Dish pizza in LA, it's (FILL IN THE BLANK).\" You become an instant sensation.THE HISTORY* A mom and pop restaurant that prepares comfort style bistro food from old family recipes. You're getting a mosaic of Italian, French, Spanish, Cuban, and Midwest American cuisine. * They have a revolving oven that's over 80 years old, which is used to make the deep dish pizza and fresh breads that are baked daily. The menu is an assortment of paninis, burgers, desserts, crepes, pastries, pizzas, soups, entrees, salads, and pastas. Here's their complete inventory (masaofechopark.com/masa-\u2026).* Uses organic and local produce, along with imported favorites from Chicago. It's also Vegetarian and Vegan friendly.CHICAGO STYLE PIZZAThey have 5 Masa Specialty pizzas, which include - Traditional, Lots of Meat, Lots of Cheese, Classic Vegetable, and California Vegetable (yelp.com/biz_photos/masa\u2026). You can also build your own small or large pizza with a slew of toppings (yelp.com/biz_photos/masa\u2026). (yelp.com/biz_photos/masa\u2026).We created two large pizzas, which costs more, but we like to choose our own adventure.* Sweet Italian Sausage, Spinach, Onion, and Extra Mozzarella Cheese. (yelp.com/biz_photos/masa\u2026)* Italian Beef and Onion. (yelp.com/biz_photos/masa\u2026)On the side, we added Giardiniera - Italian American relish of pickled vegetables in vinegar or oil (yelp.com/biz_photos/masa\u2026). Think of it as jalapenos for your pizza.THE RESULTSObviously, as you add more toppings, the pizza gets thicker. The waitress recommended to not get extra cheese, so we opted out on the second pizza. MISTAKE. There's no harm or foul with adding more queso. In fact, the second pizza felt deficient without it. Both pizzas were a bit runny, so I felt like they should have cooked it more, hence, well done would be better. For some strange reason, they placed the sausage for the first pizza on the outside, which resulted in the sausage being scorched, with a rough texture. Un-sausage like, dry, and burnt. Placing the meat on the inside would have kept the sausage juicy and familiar.The service was attentive and bright. On the flip side, it's mellow and dark inside the restaurant - maybe cause it was in the evening. Our wait was short and they'll text you when your table is ready. There are plenty of things to see and stroll on Sunset Blvd. Take advantage of that. Parking lots with fee are a couple blocks away. The meters seem like an ordeal to refill quarters.

I mean, who says \"Hey let's grab some food in Echo Park\"? Answer: No one, ever (unless you are a hipster-vegan-Masa-fanboy).Anyways, the claim to fame for Masa is their Chicago-style deep-dish pizza. The pizza will cost you $21+ for a 14-inch, which is reasonable since it will fill you up. However, just ordering one requires too much effort since you have to either call ahead or allow an hour for cooking time (40 minutes my ass). Don't get me wrong, making pizzas fresh is great, but the long cooking time means you will have to wait... and wait... and wait... this may cause you to end up ordering their lame appetizers like the meh-diocre mozzarella sticks and overrated salads. Honestly, the manchego salad is overhyped for a baby spring mix salad topped with cheese, apple wedges, walnuts, cut up pieces of dates and an overload of balsamic reduction mixed with pear dressing. Sogginess galore!At least they have a good (but limited) selection of beer to pass the time since Firestone Brewery brews a honey blonde and IPA specifically for Masa. Sadly, by the time the actual pizza comes out, you won't be able to eat more than a slice or two. And of course, the long wait times means that if you come during their peak hours, do not expect a quick turnover. The pizza itself is akin to what you would get from Chicago with a tad less grease, but with a doughy-ness that will screw up your no-carb diet because there is so much dough in each bite that you will feel like Pillsbury's family was massacred to make it. While the ingredients used are fresh and seeing tomatoes on the red sauce are a nice touch, ultimately the toppings were overwhelmed by all the dough. Lastly, I would have given them a better rating had it not been for their shitty service, especially the server with the moustache that looked like Super Mario but wasn't so super and reminded me more of a clueless Koopa Troopa.

The sun goes down but the evening gets brighter with the slow crescendo of illuminating lights waking up from its daily slumber. People strip off their daily burdens and find energy in good friends and better outings, and nothing brings a night to life like a great meal. Though Chicago and Los Angeles couldn't be further away, the two cities are brought together by one bite in a small restaurant serving big love. This is Masa of Echo Park.Atmosphere: 4 starsThe store front of this Italian eatery is usually covered by small trees placed around the corners. A few two seater tables lay out front but compared to the buzz inside, it doesn't match the spectacle outside: a growing crowd. Masa is probably the worst kept secret when it comes to one of the best pizzas in town. Huge crowds of people will be the normal decorations for Masa, with wait times lasting as long as two to three hours for a seat. It might sound ridiculous but when a crowd of people are willing to wait so long for dinner, it speaks volume for the quality of food.Service: 4 starsOnce entering past the long wait and receiving the euphoria of being seated, the servers try their best to take care of you while juggling the sea of people around. They are similar to the demographic expected of Echo Park; well dressed hipster hybrids with a charismatic smile. Friendliness is key and they are inviting without the need for the generic personalities found at your local Olive Garden or BJ's. There's a naturalness to their personalities and it's just the first in refreshing differences that make Masa special.Food: 5 starsThe food is what everyone is anticipating. In fact, the first time you see the crowds a bug enters your mind and the buzz of curiosity stays with you all the way till the food lands on your tongue. Unfortunately, there is a 45 minute wait to get your pizza once you order it. That's right, you heard right, 45 minutes. This is why the lines are so long to get a table. People usually are seated for at least an hour and a half for their food. The smartest thing to do is once you have your name down on the waitlist you tell them your dinner order so they can prepare it ahead of time. Do not worry, the food still comes out warm and fresh and that's important because the freshness of ingredients can be tasted.Masa is known for their Chicago-style deep dish pizzas. If you've never had a deep dish pizza, it's hard to fathom the type of comfort food you're about to fall into. Deep dish pizzas have been described as pizza and lasagna making sweet love. Some have described it as a pizza in actual pie form like chicken pot pie. What you really need to know is deep dish pizzas are comforting and tell a story unique to each happy eater. Using a cornmeal base for its dough, the dough is lush and rich, almost like a delicious, frothy beer. It's one crust you definitely don't want to throw out at the end. The slight tart and citric flavor of fresh tomatoes infuse their essence with each bite, and the cheese is smooth with a slightly chewy texture, making it both fun and delightful to play with as it rolls around the tongue. Garlic is a key ingredient in each bite so hopefully you have an affinity for the herb. Place them all together with your own toppings on top and you have 2\" of food-coma inducing happiness. But, it doesn't stop there. It would be a shame to finish a meal at Masa without getting their signature dessert, the warm croissant bread pudding. Whatever you thought of bread pudding before, throw it away. Masa's bread pudding will redefine your expectations. To make this dessert extra lush and even a bit sophisticated, they take buttery croissants infused with chocolate and almonds, pan bake them together, and dress it all up with vanilla custard and drizzles of caramel sauce. It even comes out in the shape of a thick pizza pie slice, and just like the deep dish pizza, it is incredibly decadent. Every bite is heavenly and after tasting heaven you'll find yourself reaching for another forkful to get back to those puffy clouds and singing harps. It is one of the best ways to end a meal and should not be missed.ConclusionThe great thing about food is when done right, it tells a story; a history relived through flavors. Masa of Echo Park doesn't only make dining delicious, they also make it interesting. You'll find yourself gabbing to your fellow diners about what different aspects you can taste or what different pizza combinations sound amazing. The food inspires conversation making it perfect for socializing and making your own stories. Though the wait time might discourage some, like all great things, virtue rewards the patient. Practice patience and you will be rewarded with incredible things at Masa of Echo Park.", "Date": "2014-04-02", "Author_Location": "La Mirada, CA"}, {"Author": "Angela T.", "ReviewID": "Hs0ob95_vIfKnJSPmLueQw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yes, yes, yes.. Chicago-style deep dish pizza.

I right away asked for the mushroom asap, as it takes about 45 minutes once ordered. While waiting I got a salad, and the fresh warm roll with butter packets came that serves about 4. \u00a0The salad followed, which was a nice mixed greens with Manchego cheese, dates and walnuts. Not too long later the famous pizza came. It was large and deep and looked good. So that is some of the things I ordered. How was everything?Here's the breakdown of what I tried:Shot version: CANNED INGREDIENTS!Long version...The roll was fresh and warm, but like Wonder Bread, as it had no crust or any flavor. Basically it is hot and nice for melting the butter and thats all you will taste.The Salad greens were a bit( or more) wilted, but they were a mixed green which is always a plus. Enjoyable without the usual overpowered dressing. It had a unique initial flavor I liked, but couldn't remember what it tasted like.Lots of walnuts(not candied) and good balance of dates with crisp green apples. If the greens weren't so lame the salad would have been the star(and earned another star in rating).The pizza looked good, but I no smell of anything. No mushroom flavor at all. And the sauce tasted like it was from a can. Epic fail! Too bad! The cheese was actually very nice textured and it was OK. Although low flavor. \u00a0The crust was good, though I think it was a bit underdone. Another 3 minutes or so, it would have been better. That is the best part of the pizza, the end crust. It would have made a great, roll or any bread, even on its own. So that's where I can give a point. The pizza was about 14\", serves 2-4, as it is thick with about 8 or so slices. I had 1 slice and I couldn't justify putting that much dough and cheese down without the return on flavor. I know it sucks as I sound like I'm really picking things apart, but there really was nothing special about the pizza other than it being a Chicago style, and yes, the crust is originally good, but the pizza overall has no flavor except for a less than half decent can of sauce and goowee cheese. And mushrooms? tiny bits with no mushroom smell or flavor....It sounds like I had a stuffy nose! \u00a0I DIDN'T!At the end, it tastes like a low grade pizza (except for the dough which I liked) BUT with all the mouth feel/texture of a really good pizza.Too bad. It surely wasn't disgusting, nor could I describe it as \"Eek, Me thinks not\", But, I wouldn't go again.....Yet I can't give them any more than a star. Another thing..the orange juice tasted artificial/fortified and preserved. I was recommended this place by 2 people I know. So it is tough for me to give this review, and I would like to come again, but I doubt that they had a bad day and used bad ingredients, so I wont return, and I don't think a bread pudding which I didn't try is gonna make up for it on another visit. Sorry....If they had good roll bread , I would think the Panini sandwiches might be worth coming back for. If they use the pizza dough I think it maybe worth a try.Service was very good, it was a slow time. Maybe thats where my$ went, surely not to the food. Pizza was about $22 (can serve 2-4)Salad $10 (serves 1-2)OJ $2 (Who orders OJ with pizza? I was simply thirsty when I sat down)Coffee$2 (I thought this would help end on a good note as the waiter said it was local roaster in Pasadena, Joe? or something). I'm not gonna expand on that.More thoughts:One more thing, as I look at their online menu....This web version looks so much more complete than the one I thought I looked at. Either the arrangement of the actual menu is really bad, or I must have been dazed by the OJ? I didn't see one mention of vegan options or all these other Panini options on the main menu as the web had! AND asking the server for any recommendations kept us in between the 2 pizza styles. No mention of the sandwiches, which he totally sounded like I shouldn't try them. I hope the manager is reading and if anything adjusting menu and staff response to general questions for suggestions. I came in with no expectation of eating pizza, but I was pointed that way in the deep pan style, and if not, the other style of pizza.Had I known they had vegan options, I surely would have ordered it.Geez!what a mixed up situation!_Change the roll bread. Maybe something with a memorable crust.Keep a better eye on salad greens to make sure they are not sitting in the dressing. Mix-in on order.Use fresh tomato sauce in the pizza. I know you claim to use whole pear tomatoes. What does your taste buds say?FAILUse better tasting and more mushrooms.Let it cook a bit longer.

I would definitely come back for the food!!! My friend and i created our own sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom pizza. It's a little bit more expensive when you create your own pizza but they give generous portions. The pizza owns up to its deep dish name.

I liked the bread alot but the dip was not so good to me. The presentation of it was very nice and Brandon said it's very popular with the customers but I'm going to tell you what I didn't personally like about it. \u00a0The dip had too much vinegar taste and I personally hate vinegar. If you like the sour and vinegary Taste then go for it. Bread pudding: foodgasm... The bread melts in your mouth with every forkful. Great presentation and was just simply Divine.

I joined one of my friends, who is from Chicago, as he put this place to the test - seeing if people's claims that this was the best Chicago pies outside of Chicago - and in his own words, it came close. It passes.I just know that the pie takes 40-45 minutes to cook. So, after some adult beverages, and the artichoke dip, we sat back and waited. Service was really great - with the exception of one mishap, where one of the staff, refilled my friend's Sprite with water; not once, but twice. No one was annoyed as it became something to joke about, as opposed to being irritated.

We ordered the garlic bread and a custom two topping pizza, which unfortunately took the greater part of 45 minutes, due to the crowded room and nature of the pizza.When the food finally arrived, it was received with mixed reviews. Having been to Chicago the summer before, I had an idea of what I was looking for in deep dish, and Masa just missed the mark. The garlic bread was excellent, and we could have easily filled up on that alone. However, the deep dish pizza felt kind of empty. We ordered green peppers and sausage as our toppings. I wasn't a huge fan of having the sausage as individual sheets over each slice, though it was tasty and well seasoned. In general, the toppings seemed to be thrown on top toward the end of the baking process as opposed to being infused into the cheese or below, which I prefer.

Until your pizza arrives. A heavenly circle of decadent carbs and cheese. \u00a0Delicious crust meets gooey cheese that melts your taste buds. Its just about as good as food porn gets. Almost.... Let me state that i hate what is commonly referred to as bread pudding. That crap is shit. What Masa offers is a slice of heaven served with an orgasm. It was amazing. I wanted to lick the caramel sauce off my plate. No component to this dessert was overly sweet and everything incorporated to it added to its flavor. the only thing that could have topped this dessert would have been to skip the pizza (gasp!) and get two slices. Its just delicious. do yourself a favor and have some. And for heavens sake don't make the mistake that i did and share it.

We knew there would be a wait when we got there -- and they send you text notifications when your table is ready -- so fine, but everything after being seated was a bit of a mess. First, no sign of the waiter for about 10 minutes. Then he rushes up, asks if we want a deep dish, and we're like yes, so he takes that part of the order, then runs away without asking if we'd like to put the rest of our order in. I get that the deep dish pizza takes a while to make, but I wanted to order some water and didn't even get the chance! It would have taken maybe 1 extra minute to just put the rest of our order in at the same time. harumph.Another 5 minutes and he comes rushing by our table on the way to another table behind us to say, \"be right over,\" and we finally get to place the rest of our order. No water comes until we've been seated for probably 25 minutes. We ordered the manchego salad and the garlic bread for apps. Apparently, there was free bread available, but that was neither offered nor delivered. So, bummer. For $10, the manchego comes with a child's handful of mixed greens, 3 walnuts, 2 dates, 1/8 of an apple, and 3 slices of Costco manchego. Mine didn't have dressing on it, not that I wanted a salad doused in dressing...but some?? A little bit? I was going to ask our waiter for dressing but I didn't see him for another 20 minutes after he dropped that part of our order. The garlic bread was a similar let down....$6 for 5 small slices of generic grocery store italian bread with some garlic and marinara sauce? Maybe if I'm at Mozza and Nancy Silverton's pinky finger touched the corner of one piece of that garlic bread, I would pay $6 for it. But not at Masa.Finally the pizza arrived, and it was good. It had a lactose-intolerant nightmare's worth of cheese, good tomato sauce, nice cakey crust. \u00a0 I was so full from the salad and crappy garlic bread that I ate one piece and was done. And of all things, the price of a small pizza ($16), which could safely feed 3 if not 4 people, is great. So why the ripoff for everything else??The bussers and other waiters were our best bets at receiving service, and we had to ask 2 different employees who walked by to find our waiter so we could get our check (20 min after we had stopped eating and had our leftovers wrapped up). It was ridiculous. I don't know what we did to receive the sub-par service but it was like literally every table around us was more important to him than ours was.So the word of the day is 'takeout,' and don't waste your time with overpriced, bland appetizers.", "Date": "2013-09-08", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Marah A.", "ReviewID": "SLG9FyZp_LHJdInuo8q7lw", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Why do I keep coming here??I always hope it will be better.

It's HUGE. you will have leftovers. If it's your first time obviously get the deep dish, not even a question.

Plan to spend some time finding parking if you have a reservation. The three parking lots that are directly off Sunset stop charging for parking at 9:00 PM, and Masa is open until midnight, so keep that in mind (although the later it gets on a weekend, the more those lots will fill up).

When one of our friends pulled out a E cigarette the owner immediately kicked us out. There was absolutely no reasoning with him. He proceeded to go hide in the back while we all gathered our things and closed out our bill for what we had eaten. He is clearly a coward on a power trip. Everyone in the group was so appalled and even the one in the group who is a regular to the restaurant vowed to never eat there again. Treating customers with that type of disrespect is unbelievable. Treating locals who live in walking distance of your restaurant that way is probably not the best business model. HOLLYWOOD PIES is a much better Chicago style pizza. They have delivery options AND they treat their customers with respect! Probably why they have a better Yelp rating yelp.com/biz/hollywood-p\u2026UPDATE: As for the owner's response... the first warning was BEYOND RUDE! The owner came up and got in our friend's face. When our friend, completely out of habit, pulled the E cigarette out accidentally, the owner POUNCED on the table yelling \"MY HOUSE MY RULES.

Masa is on the corner of Sunset Blvd and Lemoyne and it's sort of hard to find! Keep your eye out or else you're gonna miss it! There are street parking and small parking lot available near Masa but you have to pay a small fee so keep some changes with you.Next is the wait time. Our group of 6 arrived at Masa around a little past 9:00pm on Saturday night. We didn't have a reservation but we didn't expect the wait time to be too long since it was past 9pm and it was past most people's dinner time. But boy we were wrong! We had a wait time about 25 minutes (totally reasonable though since we didn't have reservation and the restaurant isn't so big) and got seated at a table.Once we were seated, we ordered mozzarella sticks and garlic breads for appetizer since our waitress was kind enough to warn us it'll take about 45 minutes to cook the deep dish pizza (O_O so long!). I didn't try the mozzarella stick but the garlic bread was great! It's not an ordinary garlic bread--it wasn't too overly oily or buttery and had just the right amount of each. But the best part of the garlic bread was the generous amount of nicely sliced garlic chunks that were mounted on the bread! I can easily eat \u00a02 or 3 slices of that, mmm.As of the deep dish pizza, the outside crust was super duper thick but the crust under the pizza topping is made super thin. Marinara sauce with big diced tomato chunk is packed in the pizza with mountain of cheesy good-ness and your favorite toppings! Our waitress mentioned large would serve 4-6 people but since we had a group of 6 and wanted to try couple types of pizza, we ordered 2 small deep dish (One was traditional chicago deep dish, which had sausage and mushroom and the other was a custom pizza with salami and bell peppers). All of us stuffed our faces with pizza but we still managed to have some left overs!

C'mon you guys! FOUR stars? What about this restaurant deserves 4 stars?I've been here so many times, and I just don't get it. People who live in Echo Park like to think of Masa as the gem of their neighborhood. Why? Do you like shitty service? Bad paninis? Fake Chicago-style pizza? Bland pastas? Overly warm wine served in little juice glasses? If you are into these things, then maybe you'll be into Masa. Me, I'll find a new neighborhood \"gem\".I get that this is supposed to be a homey, casual restaurant and isn't attempting to be fine-dining, but please - they need some stemware and to serve their wine at a proper temperature. If you find yourself unlucky enough to eat here, stick to their beer. It's actually pretty good.Now for food, let me count the ways Masa has wronged me. My last visit: \"Steak\" panini. I asked how the steak was cooked. \"Grilled\". No, I mean to what temperature. I'd like it medium rare. \"Oh its all cooked well done. But it's really good.\" Fine, I'll take my chances. And what did I get? A panini with no hint of steak on it. It had some \"meat\", sure, but definitely not steak. This was beef that seemed almost braised; not grilled. It was stringy and falling apart. No wonder they only serve it well done - they make the beef way ahead of time and heat it up before putting it on your panini. Liars!Trying to order a burger here proved equally miserable. There was only one burger on the menu that they would allow me to specify a temperature on. And when I asked for it medium rare, it still came back well done, dry, and bland.Pastas? Don't waste your time. Go down to USC or UCLA, find an incredibly stressed out college student who doesn't know his or her way around a kitchen, and ask him to make you pasta. I promise it will be better than Masa's.Oh, lets talk Moules Frites. Such a great dish... elsewhere. The mussels are usually fine, but the last time I got them tasted a bit like urine. Read Bourdain's first book though and you'll learn why that is. But now, the \"frites\". Don't try to be all fancy and call fries \"Frites\" if you are cooking frozen Sysco crisscut fries. I bet you could order these same fries from the little window outside Costco that serves pizza. Or maybe at a ballpark? Where does Masa get off trying to pair these super low-brow fries with mussels and call it Moules Frites?I want to keep going, but its almost lunch time and typing this review is making me lose my appetite.

They specialize in deep dish pizzas. We ordered 2 deep dish pizzas and apps like salads (3 - cesar, nicoise salad, and manchego which was my favorite; very tastey and cheesey!)) and calamari. Note to first time goers, make sure you order your deep dish pizza first since there's a 40-45 minute cooking time for these delicious monsters. Yes, the pizza was good. I enjoyed the freshness of the tomato sauce, cheese and the sausages. Ah the sausages, they butterflied it (cut it in half and spread flat and open across the pizza sauce) which I've never seen done on a pizza before. Usually, in the pizzas I've had before, sausages are cut into flat circles the size of a quarter. But this one - it was different and looked really interesting on the pizza. On average, I think, a person can eat 2 slices of pizza. But a Masa Deep Dish pizza - I think one is enough. The masa is so heavy and thick - really yummy! But don't take my word on it - if you want to have a second slice GO FOR IT! If you stomach can still take it - which obviously mine did - order the bread pudding for desert. It had the right amount of cinnamon and nutmeg on it. Not too sweet or bland. Served in room temperature. It was delicious. The only thing that it needed that I think would complete this desert - was a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream. But that's just me though. Over all a delicious desert. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. They give you a short orientation on how to order if you are a first time customer which I found very useful. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. Has that quirky mix and match decor kind of feel. Not your regular red colored plaid picnic table pizza parlor look. Do you know what I mean?The restroom was nice and clean.

Parking is strictly on the streets. Note that the restaurant is located on a very busy street, so be prepared to circle the block or maybe park 2 blocks down.

So we get to the restaurant and Shell, myself and a one of our guests where there but 3 other friends were running late. We were told that because the whole party wasn't there that we were losing our table, even though we have food cooking in the oven, WTF!?! We stand around for 40 minutes waiting to be sat and for the rest of our party to arrive when the host comes out to let us know that our food is ready but has nowhere to seat us...we tell the hostess (Susan), that our friends are stuck in traffic and she makes some rude, sarcastic comment that everyone is aware of traffic in LA (totally unnecessary and my friend left from work and sat in 2 hours of traffic, how to do you prepare for that?). We finally get sat after waiting for an hour and ask if we are going to have to eat the old food that died in the kitchen while we waited for a table and yes, yes this was what we we're in store for. We get to our table and we're all pissed. I was on time, we had food cooking in the oven, why am I being punished for my late guests and have to eat old food? I understand their policies and have been to restaurants that won't seat you till the whole party is there, but that information should have been relayed when making the reservation (which wasn't). \u00a0And in this particular situation the host should have, if she knew what the hell she was doing, should have said \"Look, our policy is that the whole party must be here to be sat but since you have food cooking in the oven we will make an exception this time, but for future reference we don't allow a party to be seated till all guests arrive.\" That would have made sense, we would have ordered drinks, salads and appetizers while waiting for the rest of our party, they wouldn't have lost money on us. So as I was saying, we get to our table and are pissed to find out we are going to have to eat old food so we ask to speak to a manager. My friend tries to explain that we are upset with losing our reservation when half our party was on time and in her frustration uses the F word. Now my friend shouldn't have used that word but \u00a0the manager never intended to hear her out, he grabbed our cups and kicked us out of the restaurant.

Good food will get me in the door but shitty service like that won't get me to come back.That's not how things really went down, but you can go ahead a believe your side of the story, it's fine....everyone at the table has been former servers and not one of us have ever given or received such bad customer service. The manager is supposed to come to a table and diffuse a situation, not create a bigger one. Masa of Echo Park, Your response is so false, I had to reply...I am the twin sister of the original post writer and one of the bday girls that evening. Every single person in our party is either in the restaurant industry or has worked in the restaurant industry. I myself worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years and currently work as a culinary arts instructor and I have never experienced such awful service in my life!!! A friend made these reservations and told me to pre-order our pizzas since she was still on set. There was NEVER any yelling on our part...the ONLY yelling came from the manager. Only one F word came from our party and a glass accidentally spilled and fell to the ground as we were being kicked out!

It's located on the corner of Sunset, with lots of traffic and people passing by. My first impression when I entered was 'wow, this is pretty intimate (and dark)!' Since I went in the late afternoon/early evening Sunday, the first day of Fall essentially, it was a little bit dark for 6pm.After a few minutes of standing around, we were led to a little table to the left of the entrance. The table was soooo small haha. Our waitress was nice and prompt. However, the pizza took a little while since it's deep dish. The appetizers tied us over, we ordered one salad which was plenty for two. Their warm bread was pretty yummy I've always liked it when restaurants serve warm bread as opposed to room temp.On to what really matters, the PIZZA! Keep in mind I hadn't really tried Chicago-style pizza prior. So we decided to change things up a bit, we ordered a garden-style pizza...minus the cheese...you can imagine that lol but surprisingly, it was like a pie version of bruschetta. Pretty tasty! You should opt for vegetarian if you're counting calories or just wanna try something new and refreshing :) The pizza bread and crust itself was super yummy and buttery. \u00a0It was easy to cut and it didn't flake. The consistency of the dough made the pizza extra crisp yet chewy at the same time. I can imagine how delish their pizza with cheese is, which I'll def try next time :DThe noise level was moderately high for it being a pizza place, and it's a little cramped as far as seating goes. It's a pretty small venue, so the family right next to you may as well join tables with you :) And there's one little TV off to the side lol But Masa has its own charm.

I let my friends know and we ordered a crepe and the Manchego Salad to whet our appetites while we waited. The Crepe, a Banana Crepe,($9.95) was simply sinful.

By the end of the meal, our server brought the check to us before we had a chance to ask for it, which was nice because I wanted to leave. \u00a0But sucks when you think about it... Food is slow, service is slow, wait is even slower but your check comes out at light speed ;p. Anyway, we paid trusting the bill was correct and got out of there asap. \u00a0When we got into the car and \u00a0glanced back at the receipt, there was an additional $0.50 charge on our bill for something they called \"greenware.\" \u00a0Alright, half a dollar is not a lot of money but WTH was this for? \u00a0So we googled \"greenware\" and came to the conclusion that it must be the sustainable to-go bag, which held the leftover bread pudding and pizza. \u00a0C'mon, seriously? \u00a0We don't mind paying the extra fee if we had been told about it prior but the server did not mention anything when he took our food to box up (nor does their online menu mention anything about this. I can't vouch for the printed menu because I vowed never to step back into that place). \u00a0So, lets do the math. \u00a0If they had 20 parties that dined there \u00a0and all had to-go bags, that's an extra $10 in their pockets without the customers even knowing! \u00a0Terrible... It isn't the bread pudding that kept you in business; it's the mystery fee that you charge your customers, Masa!Sorry for the long review but this place did nothing for me (besides give me a stomachache and stole $0.50 from my bf's pocket, which could have gone towards meter parking btw)!", "Date": "2014-01-12", "Author_Location": "El Monte, CA"}, {"Author": "Sue F.", "ReviewID": "pGqnNq3KXkm0-cOnpvFbhQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gosh I really miss this place.

Once I realized we were taking deep dish pizza, I was so down cause I've been on the hunt for a decent deep dish place in L.A. to rival the ones I had in Chicago in the past. Since my friend said she was running late, I decided to plop down and have a beer to while away some time. Unfortunately, they don't have a happy hour which earned them one less star. Beers I was informed were $5.00 for draft. Man, gentrification has its drawbacks. I forgot what I had, I think it was a blond of some sort and I thought it was decent but a little too light for my taste. I enjoy a beer with a little more pizzazz. The next one was a pale ale of some kind which was better. Yeah, at this point, my friend was running really late, like two hours late so I had to go slow on the beers. I think the waitress was getting slightly impatient cause I was paying for the drinks up front. She seemed a little put off because I think she thought she wouldn't be getting a tip on it off the total bill at the end. Well, you know what, just roll with it cause the customer is always right. My friend finally showed up which was fortuitous because I had already put coinage in the street parking meters twice. I had already had my heart set on the Manchego Salad and the Traditional pizza and so we ordered. We were informed that the deep dish pizzas could take up to 45 minutes to make. \u00a0While we were waiting, we were served some bread and butter which we tried not to eat you much of since we didn't want to over carbo load knowing pizza was coming. \u00a0After a short while, our salad came out and this was so awesome! Mixed greens with pine nuts, a balsamic vinaigrette, little slices of fig for some sweet and a nice chunk of Manchego cheese, loved it!! \u00a0After a while, the pizza finally came out and it looked really impressive. Our server served us up our first slices and we dug in since I was pretty hungry at this point. \u00a0The pizza was tasty although I felt the tomato sauce could have used a tad more seasoning. It also didn't seem to hold up as a deep dish like the ones I've had in Chicago because it was kind of goopy(?) causing the ingredients to slide off on the plate making it slightly challenging to pick up and eat so a fork is needed to shovel this baby into your mouth. \u00a0Still, it was highly enjoyable to eat and I'd order something like this again.One strange thing is our pizza pie was set on an elevated metal rack and I think the rack was a little bent so halfway through our meal, the pizza pie slid off and went crashing onto the floor! \u00a0The servers were apologetic and what was incredible is they offered to remake a whole new pizza for us of which we were super appreciative!There's dim lighting here which gives it an intimate feel while dining. \u00a0Service was good. \u00a0Parking is street and you need to feed the meter until 8 pm and then it's free.Ambiance: 4/5Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Value: 4/5Oh, and I did tip my waitress for the beers I had previously so, a note to servers, let's just have a little faith in humanity, alright? \u00a0Just do your job well with a smile and stellar attitude and it will all pay off in the end. : )", "Date": "2013-10-28", "Author_Location": "Redondo Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Kandice C.", "ReviewID": "FiT07hrv0u5s9WIdOOTT-g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't been able to come back since I first went to Masa because I'm still trying to get over the food coma from the one night I had dinner there.All I can say is that you need to be well-equipped before coming here and understand the implications of the situation: you are going to be drowning in a deep-dish of ooey gooey cheesy nom nom nom sausage greasy hearty textured tomato yum for about the next few months.

If you're coming with a group, then it would be wise to call and make a reservation as this place can get packed.Seems to be a trendy place that attracts a lot of foodies! I went with a big group of about 10 people, and the service was great! We couldn't have asked for better. I don't think they have a parking lot, so you just have to find street parking.Now onto the pizza. We ordered the Lots of Meat Chicago Deep Dish pizza (if you come here, order deep dish). The small costs $16 and the large (feeds 3-4 people) costs $21. For the quality and quantity of this pizza, this is a great price! The Lots of Meat comes loaded with sweet italian sausage and pepperoni. The sausage here isn't like the typical small round pieces of sausage you typically encounter on pizza. It comes as large flat pieces, almost like a sausage patty. I thought that the sausage was tasty, but a little bit dry. If the sausage was more juicy, it would have been absolutely perfect. \u00a0One of my favorite things about this pizza was the sauce and crust. The sauce tasted so fresh and rich. It was chunky with tomatoes and very flavorful. The herbs were perfect! They perfectly blended in with the tomato sauce, without being too powerful.The crust was amazing! It was thick, fluffy, and not dry. Lastly, the pizza was filled with cheese, as any good pizza should be! I'm a big eater, and I was able to eat 3 of the large slices. This was probably a mistake because I went home feeling like total crap. Each of these slices is HEAVY! Imagine 3 slices of normal pizza on top of each other. I have to say that the pizza is very greasy, which is probably why I \u00a0felt so bad after eating 3 slices! But i guess that's what you can expect when you have a pizza loaded with cheese, sausage, and pepperoni.

Long story short we ordered the deep dish pizza with vegan cheese and about three seconds before I took the first bite we noticed it was made with regular ol' dairy cheese.I called over the server and once they saw what was up it was an instant flurry of action. The pizza disappeared after a handful of apologies and within sixty seconds the manager was at our table. So apologetic, very sincere, she let us know our new pizza was being expedited and would be on the house. Plus while we waited they sent some bread our way along with another round of wine. I wasn't freaking out, they weren't trying to appease some lunatic angry customer, they were all about making things right simply because they wanted to.The pizza was FRIGGEN DELICIOUS, the large size being so much food my friend and I filled up and we both left with a bunch of leftovers. This is some serious pizza, my friends. Toppings galore to choose from so load it up as you see fit. It's weird, sometimes you can just tell when someone genuinely feels bad about something. I wouldn't have even needed a free pizza, their apologies were genuine and frankly we've all made mistakes.

Both come with Italian sausage and the Traditional comes with with mushroom while the Lots of Meat adds on pepperonis... didn't seem like a lot though. The pie is thick with soft sponge dough and crisp exterior and oozing with TONS of marinara and cheese. It takes more than 40 minutes to bake these bad boys so expect a wait. The complementary bread was delicious and we also added the spinach dip to eat with it. Super creamy, it wasn't bad and held us over until we got our pizza. Overall, cute place and good pizza.

We chose Masa as our restaurant for year 2013 and our decision granted us with instant gratification!Located within the City of Echo Park, Masa could be considered as a landmark restaurant for all of the Yelpers out there. Fortunately, the waiting wasn't as bad as we expected as it took the restaurant about 20 mins to seat us. From what I heard of or reviews searched from Yelp, having the deep dish pizza is a must. Therefore, we decided to start with the Manchego Salad to go along with our own deep dish pizza, with a combination of buffalo mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, and basil. For dessert, we decided to have the must-try bread pudding.First came the Manchego Salad. The combination of the Balsamic Vinegar, honey roasted walnuts, cheese, olive oil, and the mixed greens was made to perfection. The flavor is very unique and tasty. Served with Masa's homemade dinner roll, these two babies already made our expectations skyrocketed!! Then came the pizza. OH BOY DID IT TASTE GOOD! The crust was crispy on the outside, gooey in the inside. The ingredients came along marvelously and certainly it worths every penny (around $13-$14 for one pizza). Since the portion of the pizza itself was beyond gigantic, we decided to pack the pizza and went forward for our dessert.NOW HERE COMES THE BEST EPILOGUE OF A MUSICAL PIECE! The bread pudding was by far the best bread pudding we have tried in the City of Angels. The previous one we tried was from our summer trip at Walt Disney World, at the Irish paradise of Raglan Road. The sweetness of the bread pudding and the gooeyness of the core were factors which impressed us the most. Definitely, the bread pudding was hands down, a MUST TRY!Enough said, Masa of Echo Park was as good as it gets! Not only do they serve excellent quality food, their table touch and attentive service kicked it up a notch!

I read some other reviews complaining about the wait, so I ordered for pickup, they told me 45 minutes, so I gave it an hour, so everything was ready, and not too hot, just the right temp to enjoy. It was loud as hell when I went in there, so yeah, maybe not great for a date,butgreat if you don't want to worry about how loud you're being while other people are trying to eat.I forgot to mention the pizza weighed like 10 pounds so the large will definitely feed 3 people, no problem.", "Date": "2013-03-24", "Author_Location": "Hancock Park, CA"}, {"Author": "Mike M.", "ReviewID": "y5h5OyWwHz8fbw05FFiIIg", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good pizza, but the deep dish takes an estimated 40 minutes to make, so call ahead. \u00a0Street parking can be tricky. \u00a0Prices were fine, food was fine. \u00a0I personally prefer Taste Chicago a little, but since they're in different parts of town, no reason they can't co-exist. \u00a0Would definitely go back.", "Date": "2013-10-15", "Author_Location": "Sunland, CA"}, {"Author": "Christopher V.", "ReviewID": "wIzF9e_f6lgPCJQbJAD9cA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright when I first walked in there was a wait and I was like what the bajesus.

The sauce was the best part by far, not too sweet and with a nice simple flavor. The faults lay in the crust and the garlic. The crust lacked that indescribable, impossible to quantify quality that real Chicago pizza has. But the real let down was the par cooked garlic cloves. When I think whole roasted cloves, I think mushy, sweet lumps of mild garlic. This was semi-firm and quite pungent. yelp.com/biz_photos/CbW8\u2026My last complaint was on their sausage pizza, which some friends ordered. The sausage came on top of all the sauce and cheese, not under like at my favorite deep dish spots, and the wheel of overly sweet meat, covered only 70% of the pie. The best part of most of the deep dish spot in Chicago is the wall to wall sausage that goes directly on top of the crust, giving you meat in every bite.

I'm not saying I've tried all the pizza in the city, or even that I've tried the majority, but I have tried over a handful or pizzas in my time down here...and either I've gotten way too picky or LA in general just sucks at pizza, because I hadn't had one good pizza experience in Los Angeles proper...until, of course, I came to Masa (you guessed it!).Oh, Masa, you be so delicious. But, to be fair, as I've only had their deep dish, which is generally NOT my go-to pizza choice and pretty much exists on a scale of its own, I can't really judge Masa's pizza overall. What I can judge, however, is everything else I've eaten here, and my experiences, and they are both a very solid 4 stars.I have a love-hate relationship with the Silver Lake/Echo Park area. Sort of like I have a love-hate relationship with SF's Mission District (...and San Francisco as a whole), not only because of the perpetual lack of parking, but also because there are certain aspects of gentrification--ESPECIALLY hipster gentrification--that seem touristy and insincere to me. But you can't deny that, for all of their glaring fashion missteps them hipsters are onto some good shit. And Masa be some goooood shit.To start, the whole atmosphere is very relaxed and inviting. And the servers are friendly and attentive. They aren't too good to be helping you, and there isn't much posturing towards the customer. These are both good things. Sure, my mother may have ordered a glass of chardonnay and received instead some very, very sweet white wine that in no way (save its color) resembled chardonnay, but that's forgivable. Shit happens, and sometimes you get the wrong wine. And, really, if you're here and know you're going to be paying about $50 for your meal, a $4 glass of house wine can be overlooked.Both of my trips here have started with the Manchengo Salad (well, after the warm bread and buttuh Masa provides), and it is DELICIOUS.The dates, caramelized walnuts, and apples interacting with the manchego cheese and balsamic reduction. Oh my. Too good to pass up, my friends. At least by my estimation. After the bread and salad, we move on to the deep dish, ignoring the fact that in the 40 minutes it was cooking and we were eating bread and salad, we kind of ceased being hungry. No matter. Plow through to see what awaits! I've always stuck with the California Vegetable pizza. $15 for a small (which, by the way, is huge) filled with tomatoes, garlic, cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and spinach. Sounds bomb, right? Plus, it's cheaper than choosing your own toppings, and I appreciate that. I've been here with big time carnivores, too, and they enjoyed their Lots of Meat pizza. Since I'm from the Bay Area but have never been to Chicago, I should probably compare this deep dish to Zachary's...but I'm not going to. Why bother? They are both delicious, but I must say that I like that you can actually find seating at Masa, instead of the standing-room-only-line-to-the-door swarm that always greets you at Zachary's. And, since the Bay Area DOESN'T suck at pizza, Masa seemed perhaps more revelatory to me than does Zachary's--a beacon in a dark sky of pizza mediocrity, not a very bright star in a sky populated by tons of shining stars.Now, after bread and salad and deep dish, when you're definitely NOT hungry AT ALL anymore, you probably NEED to order the bread pudding. Why? Because it is probably the best thing you've ever put in your face. Or close to it. Here's how it is described on their website: \"Warm Croissant Bread Pudding: Masa's signature dessert: chocolate, almond & butter croissants, pan baked in a vanilla custard & drizzled with warm caramel sauce.\" And that description is accurate. But this bread pudding is so, so much more than that. Seriously. Go there. If nothing else, eat the freakin' bread puddin' and then TRY to tell me you didn't get a little tingle from it.So, basically, go here. Yes, it might take a year to find a parking spot, and yes, you may end up spending $50 on lunch for two people (but with a lot of leftover pizza!), but, while I can't afford to go often, Masa is definitely somewhere that I enjoy going every once in a while for a decadent (because that's really the best word to describe the food I've had here) meal in an unpretentious and welcoming setting.

Ellen and Sam W. brought me here as a 'thank you' for dog-sitting for them for 5 days. If this is my reward for dog-sitting, I'll happily do it anytime.Tip 1: Call in your order ahead of time.We called in our order for a Large Traditional Deep Dish Pizza about 25 min ahead of arrival, and were promptly seated when we arrived. The servers offered to let us sit at the couch area [which looked like it seats 8 comfortably], but being that we were only 3, we took a small table next to the couch area.We added a helping of organic greens salad and garlic bread with thoughts of bread pudding for dinner. We never made it that far.The garlic bread was A-MAZ-INGGGGGG!!! \"Excuse me ma'am, could I have some bread with this garlic?\" There was sooo much garlic, to the point that I'd say almost too much, but as much as there was, it was GOOOOOOOOD. Garlic Bread: 9/10Our server was really friendly and nice, recommending some items here and there. Our water was never empty, as another server was always attentive to our table. All of the servers must have had a screening for niceness and peppiness because they're all friendly and kind.The Traditional Pizza arrived and my eyes popped out of the sockets. It was SUPER LARGE! 2-inches in height, each slice towering with melted cheese, sausage, and tomatoes, my stomach was waving a white flag before I even took a bite. It was so beautiful and delicious, it was even borderline intimidating. Needless to say, tears were forming at the eye at the sheer excellence and beauty that was Masa's Traditional Deep Dish.The sausage was spiced and seasoned well. The cheese was an activity in itself. I think they put Willy Wonka's special playful ingredient in the cheese because the cheese seemed ever stretchable and unending. It just kept going and going and going...The crust was like eating a lovely breadstick, while the tomato sauce was excellently cooked. It wasn't too saucy, too soupy, too light, or too heavy. It was, dare I say it? PERFECT!So delicious!The Large order came with 10 slices and the 3 of us were only able to conquer 1/2 of the pie. The other 1/2 was divvied up between us.The salad, while light and refreshing, was somewhat forgettable, considering the dressing was borderline water-light. There was no flavor and when we asked for more dressing, were charged 50cents extra without notice. We only found out after we got our bill [which on any other occasion would have peeved me off, but the servers here were too nice.. we just took it from their tip]Our tummies absolutely filled to the max, 5-slices left, and with difficulty even leaving the chair, we gave up on the bread pudding for dinner.

In the heart shape of course! I am after all, nothing if not a sucker for disgusting cutesyness. I tried their Caesar salad and the thin crust Bonnie Brae pizza, which had sundried tomato pesto sauce, sundried tomatoes and spinach. Damn, that pizza sounded so delectable when I saw it on the menu but it simply did not deliver. It was tasty and the spinach worked really well, but the sauce was virtually non-existent and the sundried tomatoes were much too sparse. If I am going to have pizza, which is already a rarity, I want lots of tomatoey goodness to make the experience all it should be. Perhaps this is why I should have gone with the specialty deep dish pies.The salad was tasty, with a light Caesar dressing, large chunks of lettuce and Parmesan slices I had to cut up with a knife and fork, and a couple pieces of bacon. Mark ate most of that but I spurned my religion for a few bites of the magical fried pig body and it was worth the potential sentence to hell it may have cost me. I also had a bite of their house bread, a combination of flaky, buttery croissant and the eggy bite of challah. I wanted to shove the whole perfect round into my purse but refrained since my meal was virtually all carbs anyway and I like to keep my gluttony at part-time status. The real appeal of this place not the food though, but the atmosphere and attention to detail.

That's a travesty of not being able to travel much and/or get out and explore the different culinary regions of our find country. Now, there are feeble attempts at re-creating Chicago's curious and hearty transport but they've fallen, I can imagine, short of what it means to be considered deep dish pizza. So, being that I have not had the opportunity to partake in any reasonably good deep dish pizza, I was curious as to what Masa would be able to persuade or all together change my mind on the subject of DDP.Well, I'm forever grateful for the exposure given to me by my good friend, T. She is part-hipster and part-teacher so she is an interesting character and someone in the future that I'd take culinary suggestions from because she introduced me to the pizza that was incredible! Even the wait didn't deter me from singing the praise of Masa. It almost draws me to infinite shame that I never got around to trying this place before. I mean, I pretend that I know a little about food and experience numerous restaurants that are often overlooked, but I cannot say that prior to March 10th 2013 I had never had the delectable pizza @ Mesa.Now, the waiting for the food and the sense of rush waitressing was a bit much. I do think that the case was exacerbated by the fact that an establishment of this quality is going to draw a huge crowd. Especially on a beautiful March Sunday afternoon where families proclaim and state their determination that they will not slave over an oven or a propane grill or anything that requires copious amounts of manual labor and preparation. I'm notoriously impatient and I do not like to wait. I mean the fact that we were tagged with a wait time of 15-25 minutes and given the way cool option of being notified by text when your table was ready and prepped.Ray Bans and skinny jeans aside, we sat in a dimly lit area next to the kitchen (not the best locale as we were bumped a couple times and alleviated that by scooting the table in closer to the wall...) and decided on the suppli appetizer and a small DDP with the Genoa salami, mortadella, and spinach!The suppli was incredible! I think I could eat these delectable spheres of goodness by themselves! The unfortunate thing is that they only come in a pair and well, if they came in a bigger order, they would be just simply uh-mazing. Crisp and mahogany brown on the outside--warm risotto-filled and cheese laden on the inside, these appetizers blend both the rich and density of the inside to out with the robust nature of the pomodoro sauce accompaniment. It was, by far, an interesting appetizer and one most appreciated by me. A must get (again) if I ever make it back to Masa!Pizza to me is hard to mess up. I mean, I'm not too overall picky with pizza in all its incarnations. Whether it be NY style or the much-adored Naples-style, it's hard not to love pizza and enjoy all it offers. I mean, c'mon! You can have bacon or spinach or grilled gouda or habaneros on your pizza and it'll be edible and enjoyable. Personal choice in the creation and tweaking of pizza tends to be what piques most pizza eaters and with the bountiful amount of them @ Masa it was difficult to decide on what 3 toppings I selected the aforementioned pizza and when it came out it was like being given a transcendent DDP that quickly changed my opinion on the dish.Masa is on a different level in regards to who makes pretty delicious DDP out here on the West Coast. The crust was a perfect crunch and it had the texture of the namesake (Masa) and it was delectable as much as it housed the copious amount of mozzarella and pear tomatoes that basically launched the pie into a stratosphere of contrasting flavors. The spinach, mortadella and salami blended their rustic saltiness to the pizza and meshed well with the acidic bite of the sauce. Bite after bite the copious amounts of cheese strung together delicious bliss and I became an instant fan. It was, by far, one of those things that you have to try. We couldn't even finish the pizza since we were full and content with the appetizer and the pizza that we did not partake in the desserts.Next time: We will try and tackle the bread pudding as that has came highly recommended and it is something that will have to be saved for a later time.So in closing, I do believe that Masa helped school me to the DDP game.", "Date": "2013-03-11", "Author_Location": "Lakewood, CA"}, {"Author": "Robert T.", "ReviewID": "aUZ-CoQJ1mYzkFKC5kIVrg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "And to think that when I worked in Echo Park in the early- to mid- nineties, it wasn't exactly a safe area at night. \u00a0It has morphed into Hipster central.

He recommended the Firestone Double Barrel and the Firestone Honey Blonde, both great selections for our meal. \u00a0Not a huge selection of beers on tap but definitely good quality. \u00a0GF had two Double Barrels, and I enjoyed a menage a trois with two Honey Blondes. Overall, a strong 4* (really a 4 1/2) meal with a little wiggle room to grow. \u00a0Now, yes, it can be a bit pricey, but come on, this is a dining experience. \u00a0This is not soggy Pizza Slut garbage while watching the Broncos castrate the Chargers on a random Monday night! \u00a0Sometimes you step up for an experience like this.Pros: \u00a0Street parking and a decent sized pay lot across the street; charming atmosphere, clean restrooms, friendly service. \u00a0A side note about the service, it was very efficient as the both the hostess (sorry, did not get her name) and the bussing staff chipped in to make sure our drinks and grub were well stocked.Most crucial of all...a hearty, delicious Chicago style pie. \u00a0Excellent! \u00a0Oh, and the croissant bread pudding everyone is mentioning? \u00a0Definitely worth a try! \u00a0I am not sure if I am a bread pudding fan, but this example with the croissant is unique and so rich with gooey goodness!Cons: \u00a0Nothing to stop me from going back. \u00a0Can be a little loud..I felt like Mel Gibson in What a Girl Wants, except everyone was talking aloud! \u00a0But if you know this going in, then it is part of the charm and ambiance...or is that um-Beyonce?Again, a tad pricey for a weekly go to, but more than fair for the occasional splurge or even special occasion. \u00a0If I remember accurately, two Double Barrels, two Honey Blondes, artichoke dip, baked minestrone, small Classic Vegetable, and one bread pudding ran $71 plus tip. \u00a0And be prepared for leftovers! Really not too bad for a special occasion or a fun date night!And I can't believe I almost forgot the unsung hero, the Drysdale to the Koufax, the Joe Pesci/Tommy DeVito who nearly steals the show from DeNiro...the Cuban bread!!!

I heard the hostess tell groups of 4 or more that their wait time would be about 40-50 minutes. Yikes...2. Upon being seated, you'll be welcomed shortly with a nice, round, soft loaf of bread. Considering the courses we had ahead of us, I braced myself and just sampled a small slice of bread. It was warm, soft, and had a light sweetness. 3. We ordered the Artichoke dip which was incredible. Creamy, red-peppery, melt-in-your-mouth dip, but they served it with the same type of bread! The bread is good... but it didn't stand up to the dip. I wanted something more sturdy and chewy and textury against soft creaminess of the dip. yelp.com/biz_photos/CbW8\u20264. Next up was the Manchego salad. This thing was a symphony of flavor on my tongue. \u00a0It's sweet, tart, acidic, nutty all in one bite courtesy of the diced green apples, candied walnuts, pear dressing and balsamic vinegar. I will order this every single time we go. yelp.com/biz_photos/CbW8\u20265. And of course we had to have their famous Chicago deep-dish style pizza. We opted for the traditional which has mushrooms and sausage. After eating everything else, I could only handle one slice of the pizza. The sausage was tasty, the mushrooms sort of disappeared into the tomato sauce and the crust was out of this world. It was like a pizza baked into a pastry crust. So. Effing. Good. yelp.com/biz_photos/CbW8\u20266. Lastly, we had the Bread Pudding for dessert. It was moist, rich and fluffy with the right amount of chocolate. I only wish they had added more caramel sauce to the dish. But if you wanted extra, you could pay an extra $1 for it. Jeez, just hook it up!yelp.com/biz_photos/CbW8\u2026 CONS:1. This place is pretty small and the spacing is cramped. I was seated at a 2 person table and they have to bring an additional TV table on the side to place your food on. 2. It is ridiculously LOUD in here! If you enjoy talking with your company instead of staring off and eating quietly, this place may annoy you. There's no music, just the loud chatter of guests. 3. Parking is a bitch.

While I am a rampant meat-eater, I still favor the Spinach-Garlic stuffed pizza, and for 16 years have insisted that Piero's Pizza in Highland Park, IL is the best (and well worth having it shipped FedEx from their Web site).That said, Masa does it right -- the owners are from Chicago and they do an excellent job of incorporating the cornmeal-based crust with a savory tomato sauce. A bit chunky on the tomatoes for my liking, which is why we're going 4-stars here, however, I have selected this for my 100th review as it's probably my favorite LA restaurant that I have not yet reviewed.Masa delivers but you can also pick up. If you want one of the yummy pies, you best call a couple hours in advance -- it will take at least an hour -- but it's worth the wait, and you can keep it warm in your oven.Masa also has great french fries -- crinkle cut. I mention this now because my belly warrants it -- \"french fries & pizza\" was once my personal fight song. The soup. Masa has a potato-leek soup that is to die for. Totally took me by surprise, but this was the best potato-leek soup i've ever had, with chunky bits of boiled potato and a touch of creme, with the killer, warm, Cuban bread that's a staple of the place, and alone qualifies the Bakery surname of this cafe & pizza joint. They have Firestone IPA on tap as well as Fat Tire. Another plus -- especially if you're on your way downtown or to the Dodgers game. Finally, specialty sandwiches -- you can check out their menu at one of those menupix sites (menupix.com/losangeles/r\u2026) The Spanish Burger is a nice spicy treat -- and it comes with fries!OK, now that la cin is out of the way, I can get back to writing about my new (temporary?) stomping grounds in the bay area.

Of course I'm talking about the deep dish pizza - go deep or go home! My friend Matt was the one who introduced me to this little gem of a place one night on one of our many Echo Park/Silver Lake adventures. Because this place is usually pretty busy, they recommend that if you want to order a deep dish pizza, you should call them about 20 minutes before you arrive so they can get it started. It takes about 45 minutes for the pizza to bake (Masterpieces take time after all) so if you combine travel time and wait time for a table, your pizza should be ready right around the time you sit down. Fun Fact #1 (Because I'm a big dork that reads everything put in front of me): Apparently, the restaurant used to be an old Von De Kamps bakery and the oven where they bake the delicious pizzas has been around since then. Their deep dish pizzas actually require the old ovens because a more efficient pizza oven would cook the outsides of the pizza too quickly and not the middle. Fun Fact #2: The pizza dough is actually made out of corn meal, thus the name \"Masa\". Not your traditional pizza dough, but very delicious and flavorful - never thought I'd say that about pizza dough.Fun Fact #3: Masa used to be a Cuban bakery and the bread they serve before dinner is a throwback to that tradition. Yum!I didn't have room after dinner to try it, but I was told the bread pudding is worth stopping for. I'll definitely try to save room next time. Also, Masa has their own special IPA brew. Pretty tasty and very affordable ($5 I believe). Yum! If you're getting the Chicago Deep Dish, make sure to bring an appetite and probably at least 3 people. Believe me, you will have leftovers. It only took me two slices to get full but those slices are pretty loaded. And finally, as a cute Valentine's Day side note, they do a special heart shaped deep dish pizza by request.

I've been to Chicago and have had legit deep dish and I'm telling you that in all of California, Masa of Echo Park is one of the best. APPETIZERS:I highly recommend the \"Suplee\" which is basically warm breaded rice balls drenched in marinara sauce. They serve them in pairs so depending on how big your party is, I'd say one per person is enough to prep for the tasty entree to come. DEEP DISH PIZZA:I've been back at least 3 times since I've been introduced. The crust is flaky, tasty and thick and the ingredients are fresh and generously allocated in, around and on top of the pizza. They make their pizza's super cheesy (YUM!) and you are instantly mesmerized by how decadent and easily the flavors blend together. My favorite is actually the vegetarian pizza (spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichokes & roasted garlic). I find the meat to be a little too salty (because they are generous with their ingredients).I haven't tried their regular pizza yet but I hear they are superb.

That should tell you a lot about their portions *cough* HUGE *cough*.Since we'd be hungry while waiting, we ordered a chicken panini ($8.95) as like an appetizer.Now since this is a bakery as well...they REALLY know how to make delicious tasting bread. Our panini came with a pretzel like bread that was absolutely delicious. Had a great crunch when you bit into it at first..but the inside was soo soft and fluffly.The pizza was larger than I thought it was going to be (even for a small), but not that deep. The crust reminds me of like a hybrid between cornbread and biscuits. Its flaky rather than soft and chewy.

Little Caesar's is down the street fool. Yes, the prices are a bit steep (up to $20 for a large) but it's worth your paper & time. Speaking of time, anticipate a 30-45 minute wait for your order.

Pints range in the vicinity of $5-6. If suds aren't your style, no need to fret sweet thing. Masa also provides a suitable selection of wines - I am not a wine connoisseur, but I did catch \"Sideways\" on Showtime the other night. Now if you find yourself in the area before noon, I recommend the Brioche French Toast.

One point of contention I've had living in LA is the lack of Pizzeria Uno. Somehow it took me nearly five years to find out about Masa. Before I delve into the particulars, I've always been annoyed at the endless banter I hear between which is better: thin crust or deep dish. Honestly, I think they are animals too different to be classified in the same culinary Genus. Put briefly, just don't compare them! My two cents aside, Masa's rendition was an appropriate hybrid of the Chicago classic taste with some Echo Park quirk and flair. Firstly, it should be noted that Masa's deep dish pizzas are the absolute largest I've ever seen. Normally, due to its thickness and density, Chicago deep dish pizzas (even large sized) are small diameter...with a large being about the size of a thin crust small. Masa does not scale the diameter even a bit. A $20.00 large deep dish is the mass of about 3 comparable large thin crusts. In other words, it's a tremendous deal for the money! In every bite you can taste the attention to detail that goes into the ingredients. Masa would seem to be very passionate about using fresh ingredients and making food in slow fashion. (proof of this is the nearly 30 to 40 minute lead time you need to give when ordering a deep dish). One quirk is the ground sausage pancake that only covers the inner third of the pie...that was a bit odd. Final thoughts... for the deep dish newbie, don't come with any existing notions or comparisons to thin crust. Be sure to savor the crust as it's the defining pleasure of this style.

They don't feel like they work there, they feel like friends. It's probably their attitude, and maybe the homely decor, that makes every experience feel less like a restaurant and more like a meal in a friend's home.The food, however, is excellent and that probably can be attributed to one important fact: Masa bakes their own bread. And, aside from their pizza, the best incarnation of said bread is their cuban roll. A wonderfully buttery white bread that goes great with breakfast, or as a panini. Whenever I need a quick dinner within walking distance, a panini from Masa is always my default choice.Though the pizzas take 45 minutes to make, they are amazing. I haven't had too much deep dish experience but Masa is certainly one of the best pizzas in LA that I've had. And don't get cocky - these things will FILL YOU UP.

The gnocchi is so fluffy, like a cloud. I have never had gnocchi cooked so well. Now, I am a garlic lover and this had a ton of garlic, so if you order on a date, bring a breath mint. I also have never been a fan of peas, but added in with the mushrooms and cream sauce, the burst of flavor was a nice off set to the richness of the sauce. Plus they were cooked perfectly. This dish could be a contestant for my last meal on earth race. We also ordered the artichoke dip which is not like any run of the mill artichoke dip. You can actually see and taste the artichokes which have not been smouthered with cream. It was definitely not what I was expecting but was pleasantly surprised. It was also served with a loaf of bread that calmed the intense flavoring of the artichokes. AND how can I not recommend the PIZZA!!! As someone who has been to Chicago and loves deep dish way too much, Masa's pizza was incredible. We ordered the small and we definitely had more than a half a pizza left over. The bread was perfection. We ordered the traditional and it came with a sausage patty on top. So you can get a bit of sausage in every bite.

It has feel of the city with it's quaint funky cafes everywhere. The menu is very much Italian with pizza and pasta to boot. Of course, I was here for the pizza, which I was looking forward to since I saw a post of from one of the yelp buddies.Since I was here before my Dodger game (seriously it's a couple minutes away from the stadium) and early enough, we ordered the deep dish pizza. Since my companion didn't like sausage I couldn't order any of their specialty pizzas and we couldn't add any meat on the ones with veggies, so we had to go with a build-your-own small ($12.95 - 8 slices) with pepperoni only (add $3.00). Our waitress said it would take 40-45 minutes. Sure...no problem...we had time to spare. Well, it actually took less than that, more like 35 mins. Cool! OMG! Pizza was yummy. I love the garlic in the pizza sauce, as well as the chunks of tomatoes in every bite. Also, I love how the pizza cheese would still string as I pulled off each slice. And what is this...The crust at the bottom (underneath the pizza) is crispy?! Yup, I could actually hold it. Huh?!So, where did it fall short? It wasn't a true deep dish pizza in my eyes. Deep dish means you can't pick it up with your hands but only with a knife and fork. It was more like a thick crust pizza, if anything. Did I love it? Yes I did! But it's not a Chicago deep dish style pizza. For a second there, I thought they were going to give Lou Malnati's a run for their money.The staff is very nice and attentive.

We hung out, enjoyed many Firestone-Walker beers and just when we didn't think we could get any hungrier... out came the masterpiece.We ordered a sausage, pepperoni and mushroom Chicago-style pizza and I gotta say, it was awesome! The crust was their own and very unique, but I could tell upon the first bite that this place has some serious pizza making ovens in the back... this was some high-temp, stone cooked, Chicago pizza. And the sausage came in more of a \"patty\" which is also true to its roots.As you should know by now, I loved it and think you will too.

Got the deep dish sausage and mushroom, and it was the closest to the real thing I have had in California. (Actually, I am partial to the Uno/Due's buttery biscuit-type crust and this was more bready, so it may be closer than I am giving it credit for.) However, still delicious and worth the drive. Also tried the breaded risotto appetizer (Suppli?) which was good, not great. Croissant bread pudding is definitely worth saving room for so plan ahead and don't eat too much pizza!We had Athena for our waitress, and she may be the best server I have ever had anywhere! Very friendly and helpful, couldn't ask for more. Warned us about the 40 minute wait for the pizza and did everything just so; she was there when we needed her w/o being overbearing or pushy.Now the atmosphere... Decorated nice enough with funky artwork from someone's mother (I think the owner?) and old movies playing, but not my ideal for a Chicago-style pizza place. Single bathroom (plus one for disabled access) and no parking lot is understandable for the area, although inconvenient.

Anyway, it was good enough.We tried the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding - Masa's signature dessert: chocolate, almond & butter croissants, pan baked in a vanilla custard & drizzled with warm caramel sauce - BUT it was disappointing. Maybe had too high of an expectation? Since it's baked in vanilla custard, I thought it'd be more moist and soft, but a bit of a throat choker, with it being just bread-y.For all that, it didn't come out to much.

It was soft, toasty and adding just the right amount of butter was perfection. However, I did not feel the same about the pizza. The first initial bites was delicious but the excessive doughy-ness of the pizza coupled with the lack of sauce really didn't do anything for me. On top of this, the sausage was cut really strangely. Instead of cubes or medallions of meat, the sausage was cut into strips so they laid straight across the entire slice.

I'd recommend anything with their bread, or the paninis. Very cute, comfortable atmosphere. The hipster waitstaff weren't the friendliest people, and the service was a little lacking at times. We've always come in large groups and never had to wait long for a table.

You can't ask for better service than that.The bread here is so good I usually order panini (chicago combo and parmesana are both great) but I've had the burger (decent), a couple pasta dishes (above average), the meatloaf (solid), the bistro pizza (holy shit is the five cheese one amazing. that goat cheese! ugh! so good!) and the chicago deep-dish style pizza (once the excitement wears off that you've ordered a deep dish pizza it's sub-standard, but for LA that means it is good). On my most recent visit I tried the artichoke dip -- which is served with another loaf of Masa's amazing bread -- and a spinach and mushroom crepe, which was good.

A simple, \"I'll bring you a knife for your burger, if you'd like\" would have sufficed. I felt really awkward making any simple requests for the rest of the evening.

It's dimly lit and loud with the sounds of happy diners. It felt packed, but not crowded, and in a city obsessed with the newest and the slickest, Masa seemed perfectly happy to be doing it's own thing.

Not the powder, not a buttery paste, but chunks of soft, flavorful, garlic. My God, it was full of stars.The Double Barrel beer is apparently a call to English beers and was very good. Not as dark as a Newcastle, there was a lightness to the beer so it never overpowered anything.I'm not a wine guy, what we ordered I enjoyed sipping on, but every one around me seemed to approve as well, so there you go.Our waiter, who was excellent, and I wish I caught his name to praise him here (tall, dark hair, glasses, awesome), asked if we'd like to move to a bigger table because the pizza we ordered was just too big for our current table.I literally shivered with excitement at what was to come.The pizza was indeed gigantic and laden with meat as promised. The middle of the pizza had crispy sausage patty with cheese baked onto it, and it had the texture of something that was fried on the edges. I'm not saying it was, but it had that crispiness in some places. The cheese was stringy and had a nice flavor. Beyond the the sausage patty were lots of pepperoni all on a soft, buttery crust. It was outstanding. I felt bad not finishing all my crusts, but I had to get more of that sausage patty.I see in lots of reviews the advice to call in an order 20 minutes early, and if you're pressed for time, that's a great idea, but otherwise, respect the meal, man.This isn't the place you come and grab a quick bit before the movie, it's where you come after to sit and discuss the movie.

Since the majority of our group was from Chicago, the critics will be tough. So what's the verdict? Definitely recommended, we all liked their version of the deep-dish pizza. Would I compare Masa's to Malnati's? Nope, It's like comparing Kobe Bryant to Michael Jordan.....LOL (if you've ever had deep-dish Chicago pizza, you know what I'm talking about ;)BTW, the owner made sure that our table was very well taken care of! Will definitely come back!FYI - make room for the Masa's Signature croissant bread pudding!!!!", "Date": "2010-07-12", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Brittany B.", "ReviewID": "PVrG9Oju7NsAT8-RIlyCiQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I know multiple people (with great taste) who have chosen Masa's deep dish pizza as their favorite pizza in Los Angeles...and between Mozza, Larchmont, Z Pizza...and, I'll admit it, I love Costco too, that is a bold statement. So, mad respect, Masa. Deep dish is not really my thing - but if you are into it, this place does it right. The crust and the sauce really do shine. My friend is vegan - and his vegan deep dish pizza still tasted fabulous. (I've also had it with regular cheese.) Another one of my friends is allergic to basil so she could not partake in the deep dish pizza (basil in the sauce) but had a modified version of the gnocchi, that they so accommodatingly prepared just for her, which tasted so decadently delicious. I had the Manchengo salad - manchengo cheese, pine nuts, dates - a great salad - $3.50 to add chicken gets you almost an entire breast. The deep dish does take 45 minutes, but your server will make you aware of that soon after sitting down so you can order as soon as possible. Been here on a busy Friday night and a less-busy Sunday night and had fantastic service both times. Nice ambiance - low lit and Christmas lights but you will not be blind. I love the fact that this place is a nice, relaxing dining experience and is not overpriced in the slightest. I could see this being a nice date spot: split a small deep dish pizza and have a bottle of wine while you wait.

Unsure about the parking situation, the roomie and I called in an order and headed east on Sunset to pick it up.

The staff was very warm and acted as if I was a regular, as opposed to someone who had done the Internet equivalent of closing my eyes, spinning a globe and putting my finger down.The roomie and I both partook of the caprese sandwich with added prosciutto and split a chocolate croissant for dessert. She got the salad as a side, whereas I got the tasty seasoned fries. Bonus points for the fries being CRINKLE STYLE. A-may-zing. It was a little pricier than the old sandwich shop, but I didn't mind one little bit.

Anyway, the food...1. Chicago Deep Dish - I'll say that this is my first experience with this sort of deep dish so I can't really speak to its authenticity, though I can speak for its taste. It's pretty damn good. The crust, tomato sauce, and toppings were all great. We ordered a large for 4 people, we all ate one slice and were full. Definitely go for a small if you're getting other dishes as well. This is a must try and definitely the draw for this place.2. Artichoke Dip - Wasn't a huge fan of this, I think I'm more used to cheese \"artichoke\" dip as opposed to artichoke \"artichoke\" dip. I didn't feel it had much taste. Don't think I'd get this one again.3. Spanish Burger - This was pretty interesting. Some of the folks in my group are big burger fans (myself included) so we just had to try it out. We ordered it and fries and split it four ways. Not your traditional burger at all, it tasted more like a meatloaf. That said, I love meatloaf so this gets a thumbs up from me. The waiter mentioned they had great fries, but they seemed to be pretty standard crinkle cuts to me.4. Manchego Salad - Everyone else has already said it, its good. This is from a person that would never voluntarily order salad. Definitely a good way to start off your meal, it will make you feel less guilty eating the deep dish.5. Bread Pudding - Holy crap. It does not matter how stuffed you are, this MUST be tried. It's a fairly big portion and good for sharing. I had it both times I went.Overall, I'm a fan. I'd give it 5 stars but i wish they offered more non-salad in the form of starters, especially since the pizza takes so long to come out. The first time I came we had trouble picking something other than the pizza / salad, the second time we chose the artichoke dip and found it disappointing.

L.A. has no football team, and i'm from a football(not Soccer) city. 2. Occassionally, I have cravings for Chicago style deep dish pizza.Enter, Masa. 9 years and several trips back to Chicago and finally, I can get a good deep dish knockoff. Knockoff? Okay, so first off, this pizza is a Lou Malnati's knockoff and that's not a bad thing cause unless you're getting on a plane to Chicago, or having it shipped here. This is as close as you're going to get to an authentic Chicago Deep dish pizza in L.A.Now me personally i'm not a big fan of Lou Malnati's because I like Giordanos, but i'm in L.A. so I can't complain. Masa's Deep Dish Pizza...talks the talk and walks the walk but only if you have 40 minutes + of patience.My experience at Masa: Didn't have a perfect experience but I didn't have a deal breaker of an experience either. See, I ordered a large lots of Meat and it came out burnt. But seriously, I was so happy to get a Chicago style deep dish pizza in L.A. that I didn't even care. At any other restaurant I would have been like \"naw, that's not gonna fly\". But I was happy and yes, the thought of waiting another 40 minutes did play a role in my decision. The pizza: Even burnt, this pizza was better than most of the pizza I've had in L.A. but with only a handful of spots claiming to have authentic Chicago pizza, Masa has the pressure of having to deliver a quality product every time. Quality control is key, because for those who have never been to Chicago, a burnt pizza is not the experience they want after waiting 40 + minutes for that pizza. Lucky for them I'm a Chicago native and could get past the burnt taste. I've been desperately seeking a Deep dish spot in L.A. and I finally found one. So Masa, yes, you get kudos for having what I consider to be the best Chicago style, deep dish pizza in L.A. \u00a0I'm not even upset that I had a bad experience but \u00a0someone else may walk away with a bad taste in there mouth(no pun intended) So if you're reading this. Check those pies before u sit them on the table. Honorable, wholly kudos mention to Masa for the following:So my girl is \"whispering\" Lactose intolerant. No cheese on a pizza? boringggggggg!!!

The hostess was very sweet and seated us right away. Our server was very attentive and patient, since it was our first time there. He told us that if we were going to order deep dish pizza that the cook time was approximately 40 minutes. We started with an order of mozzarella sticks (I know--it's pedestrian but I just love fried cheese) and the Suppli. The sticks were good but the Suppli was just phenomenal. I'm from New York and this was better than any rice ball I've had in a New York pizzeria.I ordered the small Lots of Meat deep dish pizza and Rachel got the Penne Orleans. The pizza definitely lived up to its name--it was loaded with a ton of pepperoni and there was literally a sausage \"disc\" in the middle of the pizza. For a small, this thing could have fed three people. (The table next to us ordered a large but they were three big guys.) However, while this was a very serviceable pizza, I was not too crazy about the crust. It was a little too bland, like a cracker, but everything else (sauce, cheese quantity) was very good.Rachel's dish was too spicy for her, so I invited her to have some of my pizza, and we still couldn't finish it. At the end of the night, I took home three thick slices and a giant portion of Penne Orleans that I was eating for days afterwards.Even though Rachel and I were full, I noticed on the menu that the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding was their signature dessert. Now, when a place says that something on the menu is their signature item, I have to try it, so we ordered it. Oh, my God. This was hands down the best bread pudding I have ever tasted. The different types of croissant (butter, almond and chocolate) blended together to make a warm, mushy, not-overly-sweet dessert. It was so good that I'd go back to Masa just to have that and coffee.Overall, a very satisfying and enjoyable dining experience. Rachel ate so much that she vowed never to return, but I'm sure she will. ;)", "Date": "2009-08-29", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "D.

We got a small table near the back kitchen and next to an awkward plant that kept getting caught in my hair. Needless to say, I still liked our quaint spot, since it didn't come with an hour long wait like the other couples.As soon as I looked at the menu and saw only five pre-made options of deep dish pizza, none of which could please both mine and my bf's taste buds, we immediately decided to build our own concoction. With the help of our waiter, we opted to go for the large, only a couple bucks more than a small. We were pre-warned of leftovers, but we smiled at the thought of having remnants for lunch at work the following day (or two).We were also warned of the wait time. Deep dish takes some deep prep time, so we ordered suppli as a starter. \u00a0For $8, you get two medium-sized croquettes, deep fried, and served on a bed of pomodoro sauce. \u00a0This was easily inhaled in a matter of seconds. Delicious but not out-of-this-world taste. Almost like breaded string cheese balls.Since our table was the smallest one they had at that restaurant, the waiter brought out an extension fold out, kind of like the ones you put a laptop on, so that we would have ample room for our plates. \u00a0As soon as our deep dish was brought out, our eyes could not believe it. Enormous. We had stares from other patrons who got the smaller size and probably felt more reassured that they made the right decision after seeing ours.We barely dented our pizza, full of tomato sauce, the entire pie was red (see pictures).My only gripe, and a big enough one to bring this review down to 2 stars, was that we were told the ingredients my bf chose would be separated from the ingredients I chose. \u00a0This was a very simple, yet important task at hand for the chef(s), because I don't eat spicy food and the bf got jalapenos on his half of the pie. I was quite disappointed to find out that after waiting 30 mins for our order, I come to find jalapenos on every layer and everywhere. It was not worth bringing up or fixing at this point, because we had waited so long already. I chose garlic and spinach for my half and the garlic was not minced and yet, rather big, and burning my mouth as well.Maybe my luck at the beginning of this dinner drew thinner as the night grew on so I'm willing to give it a second shot now that I have a better understanding of the menu and the process of it all.", "Date": "2011-03-20", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Andy R.", "ReviewID": "u_G_NUyBIXiA3h4VBdlzaA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a Chicago transplant....I approve!Masa simply makes some great pies! \u00a0Both their thin & thick version are worthy of their reputation! \u00a0As many Chicagoans could argue, there may be some slightly better options or personal preferences...IN CHICAGO! \u00a0But, here in LA, Masa does it right! \u00a0Their cornmeal crust isn't quite Lou Manalti's...but it doesn't have to be! \u00a0It's it's own beast! \u00a0And it's good! \u00a0The deep dish is slightly better than their thin, and more of what most would expect a Chicago pizza to be. \u00a0But don't short change the thin! \u00a0It's great! \u00a0Especially the Elysian Park with traditional gardineira! \u00a0If you've not yet tried Masa, make sure to do so! \u00a0You should be pleased!", "Date": "2012-02-28", "Author_Location": "Torrance, CA"}, {"Author": "Tyler Z.", "ReviewID": "4KcnPbm9GlKU80Qxlkq_8g", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was at Masa last night with a large group to celebrate a friend's birthday and halfway into our dinner, the owner proceeded to kick out our entire party of 10 because one of our members took a puff of his e-cigarette.

When our pizza arrived, another waitress began to serve our plates (again, great customer service). After wiping away the tears and drool, we lapsed into about 30 mins of atavistic (and arguably sexual) moaning and grunting brought on by the pizza's insanely intense flavor.

While all of their menu items are solid--pasta, thin crust pizza (Masa calls this 'bistro-style'), what I come here for is the Chicago-Style deep dish pizza, because Masa is as close to perfection as one can get without buying a plane ticket to O'Hare. Owned and operated by Chicago expats, Masa is wise in the ways of the authentic technique. Add to that top-notch local produce featured in offerings like the 'California Vegetable', including sun-dried tomato and spinach. 'Lots of meat' is precisely that, it's the traditional sausage patty that blankets the pie in meaty goodness just like the Gino's East rendition back home.Their pizza is so good, you might forget to save room for their chocolate-butterscotch bread pudding, and that'd be a shame. In that case, just order one to goParking is usually pretty easy, thanks to the pay lots behind the strip of buildings East of Lemoyne.

Unfortunately, Masa didn't hit that mark but the pizza wasn't bad, either. I ordered a large, extra cheese Chicago-style pie along with 2 cannoli. For some reason, my bill came out to around $35 (ouch!), but I was willing to pay for this supposed piece of Chicago perfection.

Let me have another...Second bite, yeah, definitely not a piece of Chicago...

I came here with family over the weekend to try their deep-dish pizzas after a few suggestions from friends. Situated on the corner of Sunset and Lemoyne in Echo Park, this family owned eatery specializes in Chicago style deep-dished pizzas that's truly authentic. Even a few of my friends who actually been to Gino's in the windy city claims their cornmeal crust taste legit.Inside, the decor has a bit of that old classic charm mixed with some eclectic touches like a large square centered bar surrounded with twinkling lights. While the dim lighting and candle lit tables might seem to suggest a romantic and quiet setting, it's surely far from it. The place was bustling, loud and noisy. I guess everyone was waiting for their pizza and conversing with one another, but in fun and enjoyable way; making a perfect place to bring family or hang out with friends. We started the evening with glass of honey blond ale and half and half beer (Guinness and Honey Blond) which were both terrific. A complementary Cuban roll arrived piping hot to our table with a bread knife inserted on the top inviting you to devour the soft, warm fresh bread. It kind of reminded me of the Filipino version of \"pandesal\" bread with the mild yeasty quality and beautiful doughy center that's delightfully good. Our friendly and helpful server informed us that the deep dish pizzas takes about 45 minutes. While the preparation time sounds horrendously long, we were determined to try their deep-dish and decided on \"Lots of Meat\" pizza. We passed on the appetizers and made sure to save some real estate for their bread pudding, which I heard is a must. So instead, we ordered their Caesar and Manchego salad. Manchego salad was excellent - love the dressing with just the right balance of sweetness and tang from the balsamic vinegar. Good portions and can be shared with 2 people. Caesar salad was huge and arrived in big bowl accompanied with thick shavings of Parmesan cheese, a few slabs of bacon and garlic infused crostinis. The dressing was made fresh and excellent. Best Caesar salad I've tasted in a long time. When our pizza arrived, it was a monstrosity and huge. Even the individual slices looked intimidating and I was already full after one slice. I don't think I saw anyone leaving their \"crust\" and just eating the main part of the pizza. It was simply a superb pie. What makes their deep-dish pizza truly unique is their sauce. Using chopped canned tomatoes and infusing it in herbs really enhances the flavor and texture. Not watery or soupy and actually holds up well when you cut into it. Served more like a meal, their deep-dish pizza is engineered to be enjoyed with a fork and knife. \u00a0For dessert, the bread pudding was absolutely divine. The moment it hit the table we annihilated it in seconds. It was warm, sweet and rich and so comforting. Made with croissant instead of traditional bread loaf, it wasn't as heavy as presumed and completed our evening nicely. All I have to say is YUM. The bread pudding is a must.Good food, excellent service and atmosphere - how can you not love this place? The large deep dish pizza cost only $20 which is very reasonable and portions were huge. We left full, satisfied and actually had enough leftovers for breakfast, lunch and dinner the following day. It's not only worth a try, but worthy of visiting time and time again. Looking forward to coming back!Tip - if you're ordering a deep dish pizza you can place your order when you check-in and they can start it for you as it take 45 minutes to prepare.

Note if you are brave enough to order this item, please allow 40 mins to have it baked. You think something that would take that long to make would be superb. It wasn't bad, in fact it looks like Chicago's deep dish pizza but the taste is nowhere near to the real thing. The ingredients were off yet it looked like a deep dish pizza. Deep dish pizza is very different than your average pizza. First the toppings (referring to the meat and vegetables) are placed on the bottom layer. This so the bread is not too soggy. Then comes the cheese and the final layer is the pizza sauce. To bake everything thoroughly, a hole the size of a quarter must be cut in the center. This allows the heat to enter.Unfortunately this was nothing yet another average pizza with thin pie crust. The ambience of the place is excellent, the service is great. But the food itself was a disappointment. I will continue searching for the real Chicago pizza in Cali. I know its not Chicago but one can only dream of it.

Has been my favorite food since the day I was born. \u00a0Used to be one of the only foods I would eat. After all that, I really believe that Masa makes the best deep dish pizza I've ever had.Right in my favorite little area of Echo Park is Masa. Very interesting interior and atmosphere. Not what your typical pizza place looks like, but I really like it. It feels authentic.I've been to Masa twice now.1st time: Deep Dish Pizza w/ Pepperoni(6/5). Was about 15 dollars for a small, but it really is a bigger pizza than you would think. Quality ingredients. Not much more than hasn't been said by others. If you want the best deep dish pizza you will find in LA, come to Masa. If my memory is right, my girlfriend got a salad, and I got the small deep dish all to myself. The waiter said that would be too much, but he didn't know how much I love pizza. When I saw it, I thought there was no way I could finish the beautiful pie, but I ate every last slice. If you have seen the Masa deep dish, you will know what a feat this is.2nd time: Kensington Thin Crust Pizza(4/5). Felt I had to get the Kensington, because I am studying abroad this Fall in London, and my school is located in Kensington! \u00a0The Kensington had Pomodoro sauce(described to me as strained tomatoes and butter), buffalo mozzarella, basil leaves & parmesan. Sounded great!While it was great, I wish I got the deep dish pizza. I asked the waiter if the thin crust could really be as good as their signature deep dish, and he assured me it was, however I was a bit let down. I usually find buffalo mozzeralla to be alot higher quality, but at Masa I felt the normal mozzerala from the deep dish was more flavorful. I also missed the addition of pepperoni or some other type of meat. Was a good qualty pizza, but not too out of the ordinary. Also was not a huge fan of the crust. If I have thing crust I want my thin crust one of two ways, either crispy or floppy(like nice NY pizza). This was cruncy, also almost like a thicker cracker. Not my cup of tea.All in all an outstanding place to go. I hear the manchego salad is brilliant.

Village Pizza on Larchmont is the only other decent pizza in town. If this place was in Chicago it'd be a 2.5 pizza maybe a 3 if everyone was super on their game that night. On to business, after eating pizza upon pizza in LA that is usually a take on the NY style this Chicago boy was getting fed up with not being fed by this limp dicked flaccid shit that is foisted upon the public for consumption under the banner of 'pizza' in LA. Seriously, I am sick of 'authentic' NY pie in LA. It all sucks. (save for the aforementioned Village Pizza) someone needs to invent an LA style of pizza or just stop it with pizza already because the whole aping NY style pies isn't working for ya LA. On to the pizza itself. The crust is too dry (don't be afraid to bring some oil or butter to the party, Masa. Just ask Giordano's). The sauce is a touch too sweet. If you order a cheese pizza you get plenty of cheese. You aren't supposed to get a brick of cheese on a Chicago pie if you order one with lotsa meats so don't let some other reviews fool you. It's also really not that big. I travel back to Chicago often and eat Giordano's and the like quite often and most all shame this pizza in ways unimaginable to most. I had a salad and lots of bread to go with the pizza myself and a friend shared. I was filled but not overstuffed.

But, when my friend wanted to split one, I caved. I am SO glad I did! Yum! I feel like this salad is like a summer picnic on a plate. There are so many good flavors in there, everything just compliments everything else so well. Kensington Pizza: This makes the NY style pizza lover in me want to do a cartwheel.

(It is of note to mention that my partner questioned later why would any one pick such a precise number at 50 for a wait time.

Before I get into the food, let me just mention that the staff went above and beyond (even the ones that weren't designated to our party) and all seemed to really be enjoying their job. The hostess told us the wait time (a true 15 minutes - hallelujah!) and that we might want to consider getting an order in for their famous deep dish pizza as it would take approximately 45 minutes. How could we resist and ordered the meaty one. We were offered seats at the bar when they opened up and snatched them promptly. Good move on our part as we got there just before a flurry of folk arrived. While we waited for our pie, we were brought a nice fresh Cuban roll with butter, just as good as any I've had in Miami. Then, the Manchego salad to start. Let me just cut and paste the description from their website:\"A compressed salad of organic baby lettuces, dates, granny smith apples, caramelized walnuts, Manchego cheese and pear dressing, drizzled with a balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil\"Yum. Not a shred of anything was left behind.Then the pizza. Twas good indeed. A bit put off at first as it did not seem to have the same authenticity as deep dish pizza I had in Chicago years ago (thick crust, gooey excessive cheese, quiche-like texture). But whatever, I'm always open to a new interpretation of something good. I release the expectations my mind had at the time and found that we were served a wonderful pizza with buttery crust, really good sauce, and top notch meats. The sweet sausage and pepperoni were just the right ratio to the rest of the pie.Better yet, there were enough slices leftover for two days breakfast to come.Moral of the story: sometimes Plan B winds up being Plan A in the end.

Seems that there is a severe lack of Chicago deep dish pizzas in So Cal, but many Yelpers suggest Masa of Echo Park. Hmm, I think the name is kind of odd - initially I thought it was a Tamale place but I'll go with it - I'm not hating too much on the hipster scene.I ordered a large deep dish with pepperoni, sausage, and a couple of veg options. $31 bucks seems steep, but this pizza definitely feeds 3-4 BIG appetite people for sure, so doesn't seem too bad.Things I like:-The crust is very good, crisp and hearty, but definitely not 'authentic' (a bit too much cornmeal maybe?) I still liked it though even if it's not a true chicago crust.-Tomato sauce is really yum. Big chunks of tomato and big portions of very flavorful sauce. tasty.Things that are just ok:-A bit more cheese might be an improvement, although the heavy sauce to cheese ratio didn't really bother me.-I wish the veggies were more prominent - the dullness of the green peppers and lack of mushrooms was a slight letdown.Things I'm not ok with:-The sausage does indeed come as a layer of sausage patty (which I have seen in chicago) on top of the pizza (haven't seen it on top in chi-town though). The sausage seems good quality, but I HATED the seasoning. This incredibly overpowering taste hit me on my first bite. Really, really destroyed the taste of the whole pizza, so much so I took off the sausage. I'm not sure what the seasoning is - I thought it was oregano, but it seems like something else (could be the seed like spice in the sausage). I'm not a seasoning person so couldn't identify this 'seed'. I was thinking fennel seed but I'm sure that's due to watching too many top chef episodes lately.If I was in the area I would hit this place up again and maybe try a pasta dish. But I think for my deep dish needs I might stick to Taste of Chicago (aka Fat Tony's cause the guy who owns the place does the voice of Fat Tony on the Simpsons) in Burbank.

The deep dish pizza was the best I have ever had! My first deep dish pizza was around Berkeley area up North and it sure does not beat the one Masa makes! Everything was perfectly portioned. The thick crust was so fresh, so soft and so perfectly thick and filling. The chunky layer of tomato sauce was perfectly textured and seasoned and did not overwhelm the pizza with too much sauce. The cheese was so wonderfully melted and really complimented the deep dish! The very end to the pizza is the crust and it is so soft, chewy and perfectly oven-crispy!A loaf of fresh bread came with the artichoke dip and the dip was not like every artichoke dip you would find at stores or restaurants. It is not too creamy and not too chunky, and at the same time, the way the dip was prepared perfectly brought out the golden flavors hidden in artichokes. Within the perfectly warm, creamy and chunky dip, you will also experience a great texture of the artichoke hearts.

It can get a bit noisy and the wait for a table can be long but it is worth it. The service is friendly and warm and they do their best to accommodate you, even on the busiest of nights. A large deep dish will run you about $20 and will easily feed up to four. So bring your appetite, kick back with a wine that they serve you in a regular glass, not a wine glass (which made me feel comfortable for some strange reason) and enjoy the best deep dish in LA.", "Date": "2011-05-14", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Allison S.", "ReviewID": "zh0sXrr6WIsCKBxbsXgmBA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wasn't impressed by their Chicago style pizza by any means, which was disappointing since it's what they are known for.

I dig the non-chain (CPK) pizza joints and whatnot. BTW, Masa only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more. Luckily we didn't have to wait at all upon arrival for a table of 3 around 7pm on a Saturday night. So that was a big relief especially knowing that a deep dish (their specialty) takes 40 minutes to bake.And their specialty is precisely why we came. I've had this place bookmarked for quite awhile and finally made down to Echo Park. We found street parking nearby and wandered over. Our waiter, Manny (I believe), was super friendly and chatty. I had done a little bit of research and ordered the gnocchi to which he immediately suggested getting it w/bacon. But of course!! We're not vegetarians! This dish (~$16 an entree - not an app although we treated it like one) came out very quickly along with their semi-freshly made bread & butter. I like that it's not just your typical bread found everywhere. Instead you get a warm mound that you can slice and dice any way you want.The gnocchi itself was actually very, very good. I just wish it weren't so salty. I ate quite a bit of it which filled me up pretty well. In turn, I could only really eat 1.5 slices of the Large Traditional Deep Dish that we ordered. My friend made room and ordered the bread pudding, which I stole a bite of (pretty good).However there were a couple of things that just didn't work for me:It's awfully dark in there. The layout isn't the greatest, but I can understand that they want to maximize seating.It's a nice cozy feeling, but the chairs aren't all that comfortable to be sitting in for more than an hour. Finally, the real deal: food. I was very much looking forward to a good Chicago style deep dish pizza in LA. Alas, I didn't really find it. But don't get me wrong, it's perfectly acceptable. It's just that I felt like it's more of a Chicago pizza w/Cali twist.The crust was buttery, flakey What I thought was gonna be the traditional Italian sausage crumbled inside was more like plain sausage layered atop of the tomato sauce. That's just not right.I know it's not fair to compare against Uno, Lou Malnati's or Giordano's, but I can't help it. All in all, it's still pretty good.

It was crunchy, flaky, crispy and soft at the same time, yet no sign of over baking. the toppings were very generous and hearty. I love the right amount of cheese and marinara on the pizza without overpowering of tastes.

This time the pizza was much better but still did not come close to living up to the hype. The crust was firm and crisp and had a neutral flavor. The combination of what ever 3 cheeses used was delightful. Again, the sauce was chunky with tomatoes and sweet and zesty. However, also again the outside edge of the crust was about 2\" high and the inside was barely filled up half way.

My friend and I had ordered the Chicago deep dish with all meat. They do warn you ahead of time that it takes approximately 40 mins to cook but this is one of their highly praised dishes. So it was without much hesitation to consider waiting.This pizza was exquisite, almost so that it was hard to settle the taste in the first outing. The crust was sweet, I suppose, it alone was amazing. The tomato sauce was also delicious and hearty complimenting both the sausage and pepperoni. The cheese was layered beneath the sauce and above the dough, stitching each ingredient together nicely.

Both the Traditional and Lots of Meat pizzas had the meat as a flattened circle on top of the pizza. Both my boyfriend and my friend who are from Chicago said that's called \"traditional patty style\" and how the infamous Lou Malnati's does their meat pizzas. The crusts are a delicious cornmeal crust, though not as buttery as Lou Malnati's according to my friend. The California Vegetable was my favorite. Lots of tomato sauce, but not a lot of cheese, which is perfect for me. I could really taste the rich sauce and the spinach and sun dried tomatoes in every bite. The only con is that I was full after just 2 slices. The deep dish specialties are all the same price - $14.95 for a small, $19.95 for a large.

Masa makes the classic error of thinking deep dish means thick crust. IT DOES NOT. The crust should be rather thin, and halfway between pie crust and pizza crust. Masa's is not.In addition, the pizza should actually be a cheese pie. Yes, a pie whose filling is cheese, and maybe a little spinach, and some sauce.

It is basically fried cheese balls made with risotto. It was pretty good but I wouldn't order it again, simply for the price point ($8 for two balls!). I thought the pomodoro sauce that came with it was very nicely made, though. I typically don't care for tomatoes or anything made from tomatoes, but the fresh tomatoes in this sauce were so soft, they literally melted in my mouth. \u00a0Pizza/Entree: The servers tell you that it takes about 45 minutes to cook the pizza but ours came out in 30. We ordered the small \"Lots of Meat\" pizza. It was basically cheese with pepperoni and this baked, crispy Italian sausage meat patty on top. The small came with 8 slices and we could only muster 2 slices each so I would say it's good for 3-4 people. Honestly, I've had better Chicago-style deep dish pizza and I really wish they had more toppings for the price point. Don't get me wrong, the pizza was very delicious in itself, but the ingredients were very simple and I'm the type of person that prefers complexity in flavors. But the crust was bomb! Crunchy and soft at the same time... Next time, I want to build my own pie. \u00a0Dessert: It wouldn't be a trip here without trying the bread pudding! They make it with croissants and you can actually taste the buttery croissant taste. They layer it with chocolate and almonds and is just delicious. It's not too sweet, but one serving is quite large and filling so you have to save room for it and probably share it between two people. I definitely recommend trying this if you come here!SERVICEEveryone who works here is casual and friendly. Our server, Brandon, was very attentive and smiley and all-around wonderful. I even saw him having a conversation with a random person sitting on one of their couches, not in a slacking off way but in a friendly way (but who knows). He was also very eager to give us suggestions for our order.OVERALLI would come here again!

No one thought it was good. The marinara on half the dishes was too sweet for everyone's tastes. My friend's penne was too greasy.

After the 1.5-2 hours of cooking the pizza was very soggy and nothing like what i expected. Am i just crazy or what?? Why cant I get the deep dish pan pizza the way I expect it? The dough/bread was still white on the bottom and the edges were not in the least toasty. Perhaps they should cook the dough and get it well done and then add all the tasteless wet ingredients.

I heard a lot about this place so my friends & I decided to hit up the joint to see what the buzz about \"the best Chicago-style pizza\" in LA was all about.There were six of us, so we ended up ordering several items. Nicoise salad & \u00a0a Masa Muffaletta as starters, main:1 Small traditional Chicago-style pizza & 1 Small Lots of Meats Chicago-style pizza.The Nicoise salad was very fresh, crisp, & definitely was not stingy on the tuna portion either! It definitely was a great way to start our meal.As for the Masa Muffaletta, it was loaded with flavor! The combination of the meat & the spicy sauce really hits the spot too! The bread was very toasty & had a nice crunch to it also.The great thing about the pizza is that the crust/dough is homemade & has a great texture & flavor. (FYI a small size pizza \u00a0feeds 2-3 people easily. )The bad thing is that you need to wait 40 minutes for the pizza. For those who are starving, you may want to order sides while you wait. \u00a0After the long wait, my friends & I were ready to take on the \"best Chicago-style\" pizzas. \u00a0Unfortunately, I was not blown away by the pizza. \u00a0It was good, but to me personally did not live up to the hype. \u00a0Our pizzas did not have much toppings nor cheese... hmmm... as mentioned earlier, the dough was delicious & the sauce was great, but the pizza lacked the main fillers! The sausage patty on both pizzas were pretty dry & I couldn't really taste the other toppings on the pizzas either because they were sliced so thinly. Was it worth the 40 minute wait you ask? Well, to be honest, it's a borderline yes.I must say the dessert did make up for the pizza. The \"Warm Croissant Bread Pudding\" was one of the best desserts I have had in a very long time! The dessert was warm, light, sweet, toasty, & slightly bittersweet from the burnt chocolate on top. My friends & I literally devoured the dessert in one minute! No joke! The dessert was so good that we had to order it for a second time!! As a result, the second Warm Croissant Bread Pudding fell victim to us in one minute also. \u00a0If you ever go the Masa, order this dessert!

(I mention this because the tile is strangely significant in my overall experience at this restaurant.) The look of this place was eclectic and homey. Along with the terra cotta tiles, the tables were covered with retro-patterned oil cloth that coordinated with the oil cloth aprons of the servers, lighting was soft and dim...all of which I found very inviting. The service was equally warm. The host was very comfortable chatting with my young kids and even seated us near a ceiling fan at my son's request. Our waitress had a genuine energy and smile. The bussers were just as friendly, even after my kid spilled a full glass of ice water and made the terra cotta tile floor around our table a slippery safety hazard. At our server's recommendation, we ordered the traditional Chicago pie for dinner. Since there's a 45-minute wait for that pizza, we ordered the salad special to start (also at the server's suggestion). The salad was absolutely delicious. It was organic spring mix topped with apple, prosciutto, candied nuts, gorgonzola and pear vinaigrette. There wasn't much dressing on the greens, but only because the salad didn't need it. I liked it so much that I was actually glad that my kids refuse to eat veggies. Next the pizza. House-made Italian sausage on top, balanced tomato sauce, gooey cheese, crisp and tender cornmeal crust. We enjoyed it to the extent that nobody talked while eating because we were all too busy eating. Kids included this time. So why only 3 stars??? Blame it on the tile. The noise level in the restaurant was ridiculously loud. It was so loud that I could barely hear my generally loud kids yelling 2 feet from my head. In fact, it sounded like everyone was yelling just so the people at their respective tables could hear them. Such a vicious cycle. Someone talks loud to be heard, which in turn makes it hard to hear because everyone else is doing the same. I want to give this place 5 stars.

Here are some of the stuff I've tried:The bread: Can't go wrong with warm and soft cuban bread with butter The garlic bread: Just when you think the bread is good with just butter, try the garlic bread. \u00a0It's the bread drizzled with olive oil, chunks of garlic, \u00a0and parmesan. \u00a0Garlic lovers will definitely like this one. \u00a0It's even better with the marinara sauce they pair it with. The Masa gnocchi: \u00a0The gnocchi are cooked just right...with a yummy \u00a0creamy garlic cream sauce, mushrooms, and peas. \u00a0The optional bacon pieces adds an even better flavor, to it. Manchego salad: \u00a0I like the different flavors and textures in this salad. \u00a0It has organic baby lettuces, dates, diced granny smith apple, caramelized walnuts, Manchego cheese, a balsamic reduction, and extra virgin olive oil. \u00a0It's delicious! The Fresca a la Siciliana is a hearty serving of perfectly cooked penne with basil, garlic, tomato, onion, mushrooms, pine nuts & \u00a0parmesan cheese. \u00a0Again, I like the different flavors and textures. Parmesana Panini - Not a super huge sandwich, but just right. \u00a0It's the cuban bread with a piece of chicken parmesan and a bit of marinara sauce. \u00a0Very tasty and goes well with the salad, which is a simple salad made up of baby greens and a balsamic vinaigrette. Penne Orleans - Another hearty pasta, with blackened cajun spiced chicken breast, a flavorful tomato-based sauce with a bit of a kick to it, crispy mushrooms & shredded parmesan.", "Date": "2010-12-08", "Author_Location": "Alhambra, CA"}, {"Author": "Fausto C.", "ReviewID": "a5ucI1199wL2VWRJyYATxw", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Went to have lunch with the sis and she told me about this place that had good food and was known for their deep dish pizza. We stopped by and it's a neat little place, not your typical sit down restaurant. It looks more like a local hangout, they have couches and chairs to sit and have some coffee, etc. On to the food. We split the Manchego Salad and a small lots of meat deep dish. I'm not a huge field green salad fan but the salad was pretty good. It had a balsamic vinagrette with candied walnuts I believe. So the salad was flavorful and a bit on the sweet side. When you sit down they also bring you a small loaf of freshly baked bread that's has the knife sticking out of it. It was definitely fresh and very good. The pizza came out about 40 mins later as we were told by the waitress. Being that it's deep dish the small was plenty for us and we still had leftovers. Overall it had a good flavor and the tomato sauce was really good. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage, as others mentioned it was a patty and to me it had a bit too many spices for my taste. The crust I thought was OK, it's a bit on the \"crumbly\" side, don't expect a chewy type of crust. I would order the deep dish again except maybe one without the sausage.

It is located in a slowly but surely gentrifying area of south Echo Park. The park and pay lot on the cross street is $.25 per hour with a 2 hour max, otherwise street parking is 1 hour max until 8pm. Stepping inside, I really liked the kitschy, bohemian vibe of Masa - fresh greenery framing the large windows, tables adorned with punchy bright retro floral oilcloths, mismatched chairs, seemingly local art adorning the walls, and a cute center bar area. Our server Christopher was so nice, SO NICE. Super helpful, easy going, and a genuine smile. I love it when I come across people who have a personality that actually thrives in food service and always surprised with how often that is not the case. He was pretty great about keeping the fine balance between checking on us regularly but not annoyingly, and reading our minds about the little things like bringing extra plates and straws before we even had to voice them.We ordered the traditional deep dish pizza and a Manchego salad. Were started off with a complimentary bread, that looks like a really big hamburger bun top at first glance. Even though it was free bread, it was soft and slightly sweet and delicious. I liked dipping it in the balsamic reduction and olive oil from the salad plate. The salad dish was perfectly fine, but I wish the Manchego slices on top were somehow sliced a bit thinner. The deep dish traditional pizza came out a bit later (remember the 40 min. cooking time, folks!), piping hot and smelling delicious. At first bite, I wasn't sure how much I liked it. I think the super crispy cornmealiness threw me off, but the more I ate the more I definitely liked. The tomato tasted fresh and the italian sausage was a great topping. The portion size of the small would be perfect for 3 people - our table of 2 couldn't finish it.

The salad had candied walnuts, granny smith apple slices, sliced dates, manchego cheese with balsamic and olive oil dressing. The cheese was the highlight for me as it complemented well with the tartness of the apples and the sweetness of the walnuts.Pizza: \u00a0It's a much better deal to get the large and have left overs since the small cost about $14.99. The pizza itself took about 45 minutes from the time you order to come out, but it was piping hot and the cheese was bubbling when our waiter brought it out. Also, they were generous with the ingredients and it had just the right amount of tomato sauce since I do not like my pizza to be drowning in sauce. The crust was just right, without too much cornmeal on the bottom (like the Gino's East pizzas in Chicago...) and was not too thick. Also, before I forget to mention, the side crust is stuffed with melted cheese!! They also have an affordable menu of wines and beers!

I've had Chicago deep-dish pizza only once, and I don't remember it being remarkable, though perhaps I didn't eat it at the best place. But this stuff--oh my gosh! It's worth the wait and the weight: all those dreaded carbs (their starter bread is too good to not devour) plus all that gooey cheese. It reminds me of the Pizza Hut pan pizza of my childhood but done well and and obviously more grownup. It's doughy, a bit yeasty, crispy on the outside with cornmeal and oily but not too. And the sausage has a hearty dose of fennel, which I love. Best of all, it's freaking cheap. Get a carafe of the house wine and a small pizza (it's still plenty big, trust me) and maybe one other thing and you can get out of there for $50 or less. The suppli risotto croquettes were not bad (I wished for more salt), and I've enjoyed the Manchego salad a few times, though I wish they would cut up the Manchego so I don't have to break it apart with my fingers. The mussels and fries are quite excellent and the sauce is thicker and richer than your traditional moules-frites, though you might want to focus on the pizza, since it's a dick kicker.That's the only downside of Masa, that it's so fattening and so heavy that I can only come here once in a while. But that's what keeps it special for me. It also has a quaint, homey atmosphere that I find quite charming. The left portion of the restaurant, featuring a coffee table surrounded by chairs, in particular gives you the feeling of being in someone's house. But not, like, in a creepy way.

The prices are very reasonable and the decor is kitsche-country and homey without being depressing. Our server was an adorable girl who, as my friend said, looked like a young Pat Benatar. She was attentive and sweet for the most part. As we sat down, she explained to us that if we ever wanted to order the deep dish pizza (for which they are known), we need to give them 45 minutues baking time. She offered up that we could always call ahead 45 minutes to place the order so that by the time we got there, we could chow down. That's nice to know, for all the \"I want that deep dish pizza now!\" folks. The one odd thing about our otherwise lovely server came about toward the end, as we were still eating, we definitely felt like we were being ushered out. Several times another server asked my other friend if she was finished but we were still all visibly eating. It was an odd way of rushing us out since the place still had a few tables available. And there was no visible line of patrons waiting.Now to the food. I ordered the fabulous-sounding Manchego Salad...and delish it was!! I asked our Pat Benatar if it was a hearty enough salad on its own or if she'd recommend adding the chicken. She described the salad as light. I say that unless you're starving, you can do without the chicken. This salad was a beautiful melody of organic mixed baby greens, dates, Granny Smith apples, carmalized walnuts and cheese, Manchego cheese, my friends. All dancing in a perfect pear-based dressing and balsamic reduction! Yummy! My two friends decided to split a salad and pizza. They ordered the Manchego Salad (I'm tellin' ya, fab to everyone!) and a thin crust pizza with veggie pepperoni. They loved their order, too. And my pepperoni-passionate friend really dug the veggie version of this meat. Oh, and we shared a bottle of pinot noir at an affordable $32. It's a dimly lit place in the evenings and you sorta feel like you're hanging out at your cool, hippy grandma's big ass kitchen.

My father went there 70 years ago, introduced it to me, and I have passed it on to my daughter. All pizzas are measured against that standard.At Masa, the deep dish pizza is very good. It is Uno-like in the following ways: crust has cornmeal in it for a crispy sweetness; tomatoes go on top of the cheese; tomatoes are coarsely chopped bell; sausage is homemade, in one piece and spicy; takes a good 45 minutes to bake. It is not Uno-like in the following ways: nobody can seem to duplicate Uno's buttery, flaky goodness in that crust; they serve it out of the pan, which at Uno's adds a sort of burnt-edge goodness to that same crust; the sausage can't match Chicago meat.But, OK, even Pizzeria Uno couldn't match Uno's when they attempted to expand outside the Windy City. That being said, Masa does it pretty well and at a reasonable price ($19.95 for a large that feeds 4).Bonus: good salads (we had a Caesar) and that wonderful Cuban bread they start you off with (reminding you that they are, indeed, a bakery.

This was my first time at this place and I was fairly pleased with my experience. My friend suggested it since she had been here a few times before so we gathered a little group of people and had a nice little dinner at Masa.The wait wasn't bad but the service was...confusing. When we first sat down I noticed a table near us was complaining about something...but soon our waitress came over and asked us if we were drinking.I think I knew what those people were talking about now...because I think they may have had the same server? I personally felt kind of rushed by the way she presented herself. She asked if we were drinking, I ordered a bottle of moscato for my girlfriend & me, and then she walked away. ...Wait! We're not...done...ordering...She came back with our bottle and then asked if we were ready to order. It got all kinds of confusing because we weren't even done ordering drinks yet. Then she said the deep dish pizzas took 40 minutes. So uh, I guess we should order now? We wanted a small deep dish pizza and since it was going to take so long we ordered one. I think we were able to get in a few more drink orders before she walked away again. Wtf is going on? She came back with the other drinks and then we figured we should order the rest of the food. We wanted two deep dish pizzas after all so we ordered another and a few other things. Since I guess *we* were being so confusing, she told us we were 'driving her crazy.' Um..our bad?Overall, the food was really good but the service was literally all over the place. Our main waitress already came to the table with an attitude that I didn't really appreciate and we weren't trying to be a pain but she just seemed like she didn't even want to deal with us in the first place. The bus boys and other people were extremely helpful though and I was really glad they were able to help her out since we were obviously driving her mad with our *insane* requests for food and drinks.Pros: Masa gnocchi with bacon, lots of meat pizza & carrot cake with (literally) a SCOOP of frosting. DELISH.Cons: Unhappy waitress and a forgotten order, but at least we weren't charged. I'd like to come back to Masa since I really liked the food, but maybe I'd opt for a different day rather than an obviously busy Friday night.

There is no deep dish pizza in the area like Masa, actually I don't even care to try any other place because that's how firmly I believe there is nothing greater. By around 6 pm, the entrance of the restaurant will be packed till people will start waiting outside the door. We luckily got here right before the mass of hungry people came through the door, and seated within minutes too. Makes me so happy when I meet good timing. I would say if you can, come toward dinner time, the restaurant looks much nicer when all the pretty lights and candles are lit. The seatings a bit awkward depending on who your neighboring table is, due to limited space, the tables are quite close to each other and make it seem like you're staring at the other table when you're not just because the your seat happens to be facing in their direction. Anyway, the pizza, is too good. I would say come with at least a party of four, or you can take a weeks worth of pizza for left overs. Even the smaller size is hefty, they're fully loaded, these pizzas. And do order an appetizer or drink while you wait, or come when you're on the verge of being hungry because it takes near 45 minutes for your pizza to come out. Their artichoke dip is to die for, no lie. I could go even just to get their artichoke dip, it comes with freshly baked bread, and even the bread is a thing of its own.

I've been to Chicago and had some good deep dish at Geno's but I dare say that Masa's Lots Of Meat tops them.

Customer service goes above and beyond here. And just this past week, I was heading into work and I called at 10:30 AM to see if they could maybe start my order and the employee passed the phone to the manager and she said they would start the ovens early to have it ready for me a little bit after they opened. Upon arriving at 11:00 AM, the aforementioned employee offered me a water or something to drink. Shortly after, my pizza was ready and I was on my merry way.I normally get the Lots Of Meat small deep dish pizza and it's enough for me to eat two slices there and have lunch for a few more days. It's quite amazing. The sausage is what makes it and it's just the perfect combination of spicy and savory. Yes, it's a tad greasy but oh so delish. The crust is perfectly complimented by cheese, tomato sauce, cheese, and sausage. Just great eats and do swing by, but maybe call in your order so you can just chow down.Side note: I was at a Dodger game (we were playing the Phillies) and I overheard a couple from Philadelphia talking about a place called \"maza\".

The service was quick and the waitress was very nice (though maybe a little bit flirty with my date haha!) and was quick to make suggestions when asked. We ordered a sausage deep dish pizza, and it was good - not great, but good. I've had a few deep dish pizzas in my lifetime (a couple from the pizza's namesake city), and Masa's version was far from mediocre, but not exactly award-winning either. It was just a solid deep dish pizza made well. The sauce could have used more spices, but the sausage was spot on. Masa is definitely a hit with the Echo Park community, and by that I mean that everywhere I looked, there were hipsters galore. We were offered the bread pudding for desert, but since the pizza was more than enough to make me and my date uncomfortably full, we declined. I'm not much of a bread pudding person, but the next time I go, I'll definitely leave some room for their famed desert. One thing I wish they'd do is open up seating outside.

For the last year or 2 I have been meaning to try this place but was finally in the area and decided it was a must go.I go in with Lillian C. and Calvin C. and right upon entrance I was thinking that this place is going to rock my face off. We get seated and the host asks if it was our first time. We say yes, and he recommend the deep dish which is what they are known for, the caveat though is that it takes 45 minutes to make. We don't hesitate and order the traditional.So we also order the Artichoke Dip and the Manchego Salad to munch on while we wait. The ambiance of the place is nice. It is a perfect hangout spot, you have time to kill while waiting for the pizza, they have beer for the drinkers, and it's just a laid back spot. The Manchego Salad and artichoke dip come out and they look amazing. The dip has real pieces of artichoke and peppers in them. Great texture and nothing too oily or mushed up. The bread is nice and soft which for some reason makes it hard to dip. The dish basically turned into artichoke spread, but was amazing nonetheless. I never had Machego Salad, and only ordered it because I read about it in Katie B's review. The salad simply amazed me. So much flavor in each bite. I can't really describe it but it was a sweet acidic dance of flavors. She was right, it was big enough for two and in our case 3.Then the mother of all pizzas comes strolling along and plopped on our table. The server plates each of us and the feast is about to begin. The first thing I note is how unbelievably well this pizza is cooked. The crust is nice and golden/crunchy, the cheese is melted perfectly, and the sauce just looks and smells amazing. Usually I man up and just go hands first but this pizza needed to be experienced with the knife and fork just to start off and taste everything. The sauce is fresh and a bit sweet, mushrooms add a nice texture and flavor, but the sausage is what drives this baby home. It is jam-packed with flavor. All I can taste is herbs, sausage, and the saltiness paired with the pizza with its sweet sauce is a perfect combination. The crust is pretty gosh darn great in its own right. For some reason at this point I started raving on how good the Heinz Ketchup was. It was the glass bottle type and I believed it was the best ketchup I have ever had. Next thing I know I am dipping my crust in ketchup and loving every second of it. We couldn't finish the pizza, so we brought it back home for later. Overall Masa is a must try.

It was a gluttonous experience, but one I wouldn't even trade for a year's supply of Leffe. True story.The complimentary bread was incredibly soft, chewy and had that little bit of sweet aftertaste that makes you want to stuff your face with it all day long. That was followed with an order of Manchego salad ($9.95 and big enough for two). The salad is a bit deceiving at first because it appears like a huge heap of organic mixed greens with two Manchego triangle pieces drizzled with a balsamic glaze sitting quietly on top and then BOOM! All of a sudden you dig inside to find dates, granny smith apples, caramelized walnuts, and more Manchego cheese. Piled high and lightly swimming in a pear dressing. Completely and utterly delightful. Then in a timely fashion, the Lots of Meat 2\" deep dish ($14.95) was gracefully plopped down on the table. It was behemoth, way too much for even two people (luckily we had Chewy, aka Randy D, there to power through the slices). It included tons of pepperoni and then a gigantic piece of Masa's secret recipe sweet Italian sausage. This sausage trumps all other pizza sausages I have ever had. The cheese was gooey, the tomato sauce ripe, and the cornmeal crust remarkable.It could have ended there, but apparently we wouldn't have the complete package if we left without trying the warm croissant bread pudding ($7.95). Whoa there Nelly. Talk about a treat.Chocolate, almond, and butter croissants, pan baked in a vanilla custard and drizzled with warm caramel sauce. Dreamy. The texture and stickiness were flawless.Manny did an excellent job of choreographing our meal (making sure we were aware of all time constraints - the deep dish takes about 40 minutes, I believe).

First of all, you should know that at Masa, if you are ordering a deep dish pizza (which you should), you need to order it before you even get there. These pizzas take 45 min to an hour to arrive to your table. We preordered our pizzas when we still had 15 minutes to go of waiting time to be sat. Our order for 8 people included a large Vegan pizza, a large All Meat pizza and a small cheese pizza. We had several beers collectively and chatted our wait time away and then was sat at 3 tables shoved together. The staff was unbelievably attentive. I never saw the bottom of my glass, which was very much appreciated on this hot summer night. One of the waitresses even attempted to facilitate a love connection between my friend and a bartender (now THAT'S service). I enjoyed the Cheese pizza the most, it showcased the crust the best.

I would order the pizza ahead of time because it takes approximately 45 minutes for it to bake. Tonight, I ordered 'The Traditional' (Sausage with Mushrooms) because it is always a good idea to start of with the Basic and I've been craving for it every since my last visit! If you order the large pizza, it can feed 6 girls or 4 guys. The price difference is not much, so I would always opt out for the large to take leftovers home. This pizza has tons of tomato chunks in every bite and the top layer of sausage is just a delight! Imagine....layer of sausage on top, slices of mushrooms underneath with the support of tomato chunks, and the crust that holds it all together! Yum!!! My friends that hate tomatoes had to bow down and admit that this was a damn good pizza! I was in a party of four and we ordered the Pizza, Cesar salad, Artichoke dip, and the Bread pudding. Everything was devoured except 3 slices of pizza! Their Cesar is big enough to split and it's well made with every single romaine lettuce covered with dressing, but not too heavy. The Artichoke dip was great as well. It wasn't the typical blended Artichoke dip; it was a good hearty Artichoke dip with pieces of Artichoke that you can actually see! The loaf of bread that came with it was warm and fresh, plus! And last but not least, the bread pudding! It came out like a slice of pie and it was warm and gooey....besides the pizza, their bread pudding is a rockstar at Masa! Get it!!!Overall, a great meal. Want to know a secret?

Needing to burn a couple of hours before meeting some folks across the street at El Prado and on the heels of being in the car for about 7 hours after a long drive from San Francisco, it was the low hanging fruit of restaurants to kick our feet up for a while to enjoy a long-awaited nibble.Masa is well known for their Chicago style deep dish pizza, but being that I've re-adopted a diet free of any animal byproducts whatsoever, it didn't occur to me that I would be able to actually enjoy their revered food staple. While a bit bummed that I'd be missing out on the opportunity to leave the 'hood without trying one of their signature pies, after a thorough glimpse at their menu, I realized that all hope wasn't lost! You see, there are plenty of hippies that call Echo Park home, and Masa knows this all too well... so they offer not one, but two different vegan options! The first is the option to use a soy-based cheese instead of the usual dairy-based go-to, and the second option is to just bake it up without any cheese at all, soy or otherwise. It might sound crazy to some, but honestly, a pizza isn't half bad with cheese taking a seat on the sidelines, and being that I'm a not big on soy cheese, I went straight sauce for my veggie pie (even though I was sharing with a 100% carnivore).Now, I can see how people can think that's a wacky way to consume a Chicago style deep dish pizza, but check this out: what is it that reeeeeeeeeally excites you about a pizza? How often do you really order just a plain cheese slice? It's always the toppings and sauce that make a pizza sexy. Ingredients like sun-dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, roasted garlic or eggplant, black olives, pineapples, fresh fennel, rosemary, basil, summer squash, spicy Roman arrabbiata sauce, and so on. Those are what gives a pizza the real robust flavor, and the cheese is just a habitual passenger on the ride through your esophagus. Like ordering dessert when you're not even hungry - it's just something you do because that's the way it's always been done, not something you're consciously thinking about the necessity of its presence. So naturally, the best parts of any pizza (in my opinion) are the dough, crust, and plant-based ingredients. Proving my point that cheese isn't needed to create a truly remarkable pie, Masa served up one of the best deep dish varietals I've ever had, and there wasn't a lick of cheese in sight. In fact, olive oil was used to line the cast iron pan, so it was devoid of butter as well. By eliminating the cheese, it not only meant cutting out massive amounts of extra calories and toxic levels of cholesterol and saturated fat, but it also meant you could happily dive into a third or fourth slice guilt free. How great is that?The actual owner of Masa was nice enough to run the pie to our table, and even commented that if he were to go vegan, he'd order his same way, as he finds the soy alternative to be a bit unsavory as well... but he keeps the option on his menu since so many vegans roll through there every week. Pretty cool stuff! In addition to the deep dish, our meal was accompanied by a huge dinner salad that was essentially your run-of-the-mill plate of greens, as well as a complimentary dinner roll served up hot with a side of olive oil and vinegar. A nice packaged meal that just about anyone could enjoy.If I lived here, I'm sure Masa would be in a very regular rotation for me. Friendly faces, plenty of options for any dietary restriction, and while I'm hating myself for saying this... you can tell their food is made with love (I know - barf!). Maybe I'm feeling a bit sensitive because it's Earth Day, who knows... but what I do know is this: Masa is the truth, son!", "Date": "2011-04-22", "Author_Location": "New York, NY"}, {"Author": "Isis O.", "ReviewID": "jL8YPOuIAtpGBU-Ug9OGpA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing deep dish pizza.

So i decided to take him here for his lunch because we are both giant pizza fans. So we get there and we are greeted with i believe who was the owner with a half wit smile and asked us where we would like to sit. So we decided to sit on the back end corner near the window. We get there and we are greeted by out waiter, which unfortunately i didnt get his name, but he was a hipster straight out with dark ray ban looking frames around his face with a stupid, and i mean stupid tattoo of a damn avocado! who the hell gets that right? Any ways, he service from the start was very rude and condescending like all hipsters are. I wanted to order a specialty pizza and than add mushrooms on it for an extra 3 dollars, and from there with his attitude saying \"i cant do that, youre going to have to get it a build your own but its going to come out more expensive\" with a terrible attitude, and i asked him why is it going to be a problem and he just kept on saying the same thing, so i was like whatever ill just get specialty pizza. We also ordered an appetizer which he took a while to come out with tooWe kept on waiting and waiting and he never stopped by to check if we wanted a refill or to see how we were doing unless we flagged him down. The wait for the pizza was about 45 minutes which he neglected to tell us that a deep dish would take that long. That would be something you would let the customer know before you ordered something that took that long. From there on just his service became more terrible and he waited his other tables besides our, and there were all hipsters and the tables, coincidence? I think notAnyways the pizza was ok and wasnt worth the price and i feel bad pizza i wanted my friend to have a good birthday lunch, next time i would take him somewhere better than this place!

The menu consists of many items that I would never list as my favorite items but nonetheless this is one of my regular spots. They have this bread that they give you while you wait and it is so good. When I first looked at it, I was not impressed with its appearance but the flavor is fantastic. They have pretty filling, fresh vegetarian items and hearty helpings of pasta. I usually get a panini or pasta with a salad. French fries are amazing. I am not a huge hot chocolate person, but I get hot chocolates usually and they are really good on cold night. Last time I went my friend ordered bread pudding, which I was unfamiliar with. It was very tasty though. I had a chocolate crme brle which was very good but I am not that into chocolate. I am sure for chocolate lovers it would send them to the moon. The service is consistent and friendly. Not too in your face but in your face enough to make you feel welcome. They don't give you dirty looks or make you feel uncomfortable for staying a long while. They have a bar where you can read a book and eat alone. I like to go there on the way to the Echo or on the way to Little Joy. There are a lot of Echo Park hipsters but it is a good, comfortable mix of all types of people enjoying delicious food. They also deliver although I am uncomfortable with this service, as it seems terribly decadent to me.

So if you like Sicilian pizza, but wish it was just a bit thicker and had a crispier crust then you'll probably love Chicago style pizza, but if you can't handle your crust being thicker than a magazine you should avoid it.

YES, PLEASE!I came here a few nights ago with a close friend on a whim. We weren't really that hungry, and we didn't want to drive out that far, and we were really indecisive about what we wanted for dinner. I just figured pizza is a safe choice.Between two girls, we had a caesar salad (romaine tossed in caesar dressing, with 6 generously slices of parmesan and two crostini) and a small traditional deep dish pizza (tomatoes, mushrooms, and sausage!). The waiter was very cordial, and she warned us that the pizza would take 40-45 minutes to cook. Damn, that's a lot of time just sitting around waiting for dinner, but we just figured why not. It would be enough time for us to catch up and enjoy each other's company until we were starved. The salad came out about 5 minutes after our order was put in, and it was one of the best caesar salad's I've had. I liked that it was slightly deconstructed because of the slices of cheese and crostini instead of shredded cheese and tiny croutons. I loved the salad, but I just wish the romaine was a bit crunchier. It wasn't as lively as fresh romaine should be, but overall it was really delicious. Then finally, the pizza was served. I believe the manager served us and she was so sweet. We were both cracking jokes to each other, and she blessed our table with extra pepper and cheese. She also served us our virgin slices of Masa Chicago style deep dish pizza. So good. The crust was thick, but fluffy, and there was a perfect amount of sauce and cheese beneath the vegetables and sausage. The sausage wasn't in pieces or slices, but it was a whole layer above the cheese. It's a really decadent pizza but it wasn't greasy, and it didn't feel too heavy. However, the small pizza ($14.95) would most likely feed 4 people. For the two of us it was too much, and we took the leftovers home for our family. I would've tried the bread pudding, but I honestly really couldn't eat anymore. It just gives me an excuse to come to this place again. It's a convenient location (right next to Kind Kreme!

Ms. Deep Dish herself- covered in curvaceous \u00a0plum tomatoes, spinach and olives.

Our waitress gave us the necessary information about the menu and recommended the deep dish pizzas. We were there for that anyway so we ordered the traditional deep dish pizza. Keep in mind when you go here that their deep dish pizzas are made from scratch so they take about 40 mins to make. Trust me.... it's worth the wait. My husband and I ordered the suppli to hold us over during our wait. We were a little sad that there were only two pieces of suppli, but it was really good. It's made of risotto and cheese and then deep fried to crunchy goodness! Our pizza came out, and it tasted perfect! The crust was thick but had a fluffiness to it, and the flavors were blended well. We ordered a small and only finished half of it. Even though we were full, I wanted to try the bread pudding. All I have to say about it is this: I don't care how full I am.... I will always make room for the bread pudding here!In summary:1) Wait staff is really friendly and helpful.

The food here is as great as their customer service, but we'll start with the important stuff: the food.Masa is known for their deep dish Chicago style pizza. The owner is a Chicago native (born and raised), and has brought his city's style of pizza to the West Coast. I've always loved it, especially their All Meat. I've never been to Chicago so I can't vouch for its authenticity other than it tastes good in my mouth and feels good in my belly. But I've had two different friends who are both from Chicago and say that its not only as good as Chicago pizza, but top 5 ever!! I'll take that as a stamp of approval.Another thing I love here is their Manchego Salad. \u00a0Can't go wrong with this salad of organic baby lettuces, dates, granny smith apples, caramelized walnuts, and fresh Manchego cheese drizzled with a balsamic dressing. Yummy!Like their salad, everything is fresh and they buy local. That also adds to Masa's awesomeness. Can't beat that!!I can go on and on about all the wonderful things on their menu, but I will end with this, their signature dessert: Bread Pudding. Imagine how heaven would taste like, and that is Masa's Bread Pudding. It is that good!!! Chocolate, almond & butter croissants, pan baked in a vanilla custard & drizzled with warm caramel sauce..... Oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it, and I just had it not so long ago!!! If you don't believe me, go try it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.Lastly I would also love to commend Masa for their excellent customer service. Finding great food in the city is not too hard of a task, but finding a great restaurant paired with excellent customer service can be a hit or miss sometimes in the City of Angels. But Masa has both, and tonight was a good example. My family and I were seated at the booth in the far end celebrating my sister's new job among other things, and enjoying our meal. The table next to us originally had 5, but 1 person came late and unexpectedly so that meant that they all couldn't fit in the table anymore. For some reason they didn't factor him in when they originally got the tables?!?! Stupid on their part, especially on a busy night like Friday.Below is a chronicle of the hot mess that ensued, while my family watched this train wreck as we enjoyed our delicious bread pudding:1.) They wanted to sit TOGETHER (like they were in grade school again), but the manager kindly told them that they could not join tables because they would pose as a fire hazard. DENIED.2.) Then they asked if they could add another chair to the table, and again the manager told them that would pose as a fire hazard (and also block my family and I from getting out of our booth). ASSHOLES...DENIED!!3.) Then they wanted another table that could fit all of them, but the manager told them that they would have to give up their table and wait again since all their big tables were being used. DENIED AGAIN! This just gets worse from here...4.) They brought up the fact about putting the chairs and tables together again. WTF?!?! You were deaf the first time?!?! DENIED AGAIN ASSHOLES!5.) \u00a0Then they tried to get to the top of the waiting list, but the manager KINDLY told them that unfortunately they would have to wait until after all the other people on the list already was seated first. Makes perfect sense because the group was giving up their table, and since it was a busy night the other patrons were already patiently waiting while these idiots couldn't make their mind. DENIED! 6.) Their food started to come out and they had no tables so they brought up adding another chair to their table.........AGAIN. Did I mention they were retarted?!I was starting to feel bad for the manager and waitress who had to deal with this hot mess. And then........7.) These idiots started looking at our booth and started to comment on how we \"looked almost done.\" My mom started to feel uncomfortable with their wicked glances, and I finally just flagged the manager over who was still trying to reason with these idiots and asked for our check. I was already in the process of asking for our bill before these idiots realized that we were done, but it was really hard to flag down any waiting staff over the stupidity that was happening before us. I wanted to get out of there before we got stupid just being around them. We finally got our bill, paid, and right when we were about to leave, the manager who had to deal with the group of Dumb & Dumber, stopped us and handed us a 25% coupon off our next visit to thank us for our patience and she felt bad that we felt rushed by the other group. She also wrote on the back of the coupon how \"sweet & patient\" our table was. She made my mom smile! Despite the hot mess that occurred, we had a good time and it was really a sweet ending to our night. Thanks Masa!!

Barely a year ago, long I pondered my king's cryptic talk of victory over this pizza; time has proven him wise. But from free Greek to free Greek, the word was spread that bold Leonidas and his 300, so far from home, laid down their lives, not just for Sparta, but for all the deep dish layered goodness..... however, in our defense we did start out with a side of garlic bread which was quite pleasant (crusty on the outside, soft on the inside) and artichoke dip that wasn't the puke resembling stuff you get from places like the olive garden. As we lay there at the table in a food coma, the wait staff would refill our drinks every time it went below the halfway point, as people passing us cups from the side of the road in a marathon.....pessimists always saw our glass half empty, but it made for great service.

But Masa only averaging 4 stars downright pisses me off. Food: 5 Stars - We ordered the Artichoke Dip and Meat pizza. The dip was delicious. It's not California Pizza Kitchen kinda of artichoke dip. Not too cheesy, which I really liked. You can actually taste the artichokes. The Cuban bread they servde it with was spectacular. Soft, moist, and sweet, which complimented the sourness of the artichokes.Pizza was awesome. This is Chicago style pizza, so expect that there is a lot of sauce and very cheesy. Even so, the pizza was very well balanced. \u00a0The crust was absolutely amazing. Crispy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside. Anyone who says that this ain't Chicago style pizza is a freakin moron. Chicago-style pizza has a crust up to three inches tall at the edge, slightly higher than the ingredients, which include large amounts of cheese and chunky tomato sauce, acting as a large bowl. Besides deep-dish, the term also refers to stuffed pizza, another Chicago style. Both styles of pizza are usually eaten with a knife and fork. While in Chicago most pizzerias also serve thin-crust pizza that is generally also in a style characteristic to the city, the term Chicago-style pizza is mainly used to describe the deep-dish style of pizza away from the Chicagoland area. Having lived in Chicago, I can verify that there are many ways that Chicago eateries make \"Chicago Style\" pizza. Masa makes a deep dish style of pizza and they do it extremely well. If you haven't been to Lou's on Chicago's north shore and don't know what butter crust is, then shut the f%$k up about what you think you know about Chicago style pizza and appreciate that you have Masa's to eat at and to then pretend like you know what what you're talking about. Service: 5 Stars. Our server Brandon was awesome. So was everyone else there. As busy as they were on a Saturday afternoon, we did not have to ask for a refill or look for our server once to ask for anything. We had dogs, so we sat outside. Brandon not only brought out water, but also a biscuit and mat, so our dogs wouldn't have to lay on the bare sidewalk. Also, when we first tried to order the large pizza, thinking that a $14.95 small pizza would be a personal sized portion, Brandon cautioned against it, because he though it would be too much for just the two of us. How cool is that? Instead of pushing for a bigger bill and a bigger tip as a result, he made an honest recommendation contrary to his own financial interest. I can't imagine he's getting wealthy doing this, especially how cheap their prices are. Did I mention that their small pizza was only $14.95 (8 slices of legit deep dish pizza and they don't do you cheap on the toppings).Just a quick comment on those who bitch that there are too many hipsters or that the servers dress like hipsters. You're in Echo Park you idiots. I'm in a shirt and tie 5 days a week, doubt that I would ever be confused with a hipster, and generally have no love for hipsters.

The sausage was the best part of the pizza, but the cheesiness and thickness made the Deep Dish a one of a kind.

While we normally head out that way to get some really good tamales, Mexican pastries and elote, pizza was never something that you'd think would be in the area. But lo and behold, here it is, a hipster joint in a not so \"hip\" neighborhood. It's very cozy and inviting inside and all you can smell is pizza baking. Amazing and talk about a warm welcome. It's dimly lit and there are candles on every table and I could definitely see this place as a good date spot. The servers are also very friendly and a bit quirky too. On to the food: no shortage of options. What everyone is raving about however, is the deep dish pizza. Considering that my only experience with deep dish pizza is Uno's (of which I am NOT a fan), I was hesitant to order it here but the hundreds of positive Yelp reviews swayed me. \u00a0Now comes the irritating part: I don't like meat on pizza. My dining companion does. Usually we compromise by getting a vegetarian pizza with some meat on one half of it. We asked for the California Vegetable Pizza with some ham on one side. We were sweetly informed that if we added the meat onto the that pizza we wouldn't get the fixed price of $19.95 (plus $3 for the extra ham I suppose) for the large but would be charged for all the toppings separately which comes out to a total of $24.95. Yes I realize that this is a very minor difference but it's the principal of the thing that's irritating. All we wanted was a couple pieces of ham dumped on one side of the pizza and you insist on acting like we asked you to make an entirely new pizza from scratch and had to charge more for it. Needless to say, we just ended up going with the Traditional pizza as a compromise.I can say this, the food is well worth the price. It's an enormous pizza and we could barely finish half of it between the two of us and that's saying something as we are both really good eaters. We had enough leftover for lunch the next day and then some. It's thick and huge and covered in cheese and they do not skimp on toppings. There was huge slabs of sausage (which was very good) all over the place. The only sad thing was that we ate all this pizza and had absolutely no room leftover for the warm croissant bread pudding which looks divine. I think a good option is to get a small pizza for two people and leave room for dessert. Don't even bother with appetizers because there is no way you can eat something initially and then have room for all that pizza. It does take time though, be warned. They are really up front about it and tell you that it takes like 45 minutes to cook so be prepared to converse with whoever you are with for awhile. Overall, it's a great value and probably the only deep dish pizza I have ever enjoyed. Despite the minor annoyance factor with the toppings, everything else was really great and if I ever have more cravings for deep dish I know where to go.", "Date": "2010-08-17", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Ai K.", "ReviewID": "ScSgTpUKjlhREGSRJg6h_w", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love their vegan deep dish pizza!!!

I ordered the Traditional Deep dish pizza, which had sausage and mushroom. The time had finally come for me to taste what the hype was about. I took a slice, had to eat it with a fork and knife it was so thick. What was the verdict after my first slice? The pizza was good, but not amazing like everyone else had previously mentioned to me. In all honestly, I was kind of let down. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. I guess just not as much as I had hoped. I think I need to revisit this pizza.Still a great place to dine if you ask me.

WOO!\" and he'd start talking really fast and then trail off and kinda hop away, then come back and finish his sentence. \u00a0He also cussed a lot, and while I talk like a sailor, it just seemed inappropriate to me for a waiter to seem so \"buddy-buddy\" with people he was serving.

I feel so torn, because I really wanted to like this place. The quaint ambiance, the overwhelming tantalizing aroma of pasta and pizza as you walk in and the food is good (just in our case, not really worth the wait).My sad journey begins last night when I decided to take four of my friends from out of town to try this place. It was around 9 and the place was packed, and being a party of 5, I completely understood it might take a little longer to be seated. 45 minutes later and with a deep dish pre-ordered, we were finally seated. Our waitress was downright rude. She was impatient, not friendly at all, and basically stared at as like we were a bunch of idiots. But wait, this is just the beginning! The Cokes (or Pepsi, whatever) that two of my friends ordered were completely flat. They asked for new ones and suggested that maybe the CO2 tank needed to be changed. Instead of asking them if they would like another drink, or if she could get them something else, the waitress returns with glasses of water. \u00a0Uh, thanks?Then we notice that the table is actually wet and something is dripping on us. Lo and behold, the air conditioning vent that was right above us was leaking. We tell the waitress and she says, \"Oh that's just condensation from the air conditioner.\" Not an offer to move our table if something clears up, not an apology, just, \"Oh yea, great, that's what it does.\" \u00a0Our food comes out, the Manchego salad I ordered came with cheese (I ordered it without,) the manager comes around, says he's going to fix the situation and is going to buy us dessert. A table in the back finally opens up and we all move over there. An hour and a half into our less-than-perfect experience, my friends still don't have sodas and there's no pizza, even with the pre-ordering. The pizzas finally come out, my friends ask about their sodas (to get two new flat ones sent to the table) and we start to eat. Another waitress, Melanie, comes by, introduces herself and says that our other waitress had gone home. The entire time that we had been there with the first waitress, we had never been asked if we needed more drinks or if she could get us something else. THANK GOD HER SHIFT WAS OVER. I could write an entire separate review of how awesome Melanie is. She was friendly, warm, cracking jokes, just an amazing person giving equally amazing service. She tried to fix the Coke situation by adding club soda to the mix for some fizz. And then we she was trying to explain that you can request a server the next time we come in.....Her excited hand gesture knocks my beer into my and my friend's lap. At this point we couldn't even be angry. The whole night was so terribly bad that we just all could not stop laughing at the situation. Melanie rushed back with towels and club soda and apologized profusely. Not your fault Melanie, it was like the icing on the cake. The manager comes over again and insists that we take a free dessert. By this time we a little sick of being there (I think we had hit the 2 hour mark,) and were stuffed from all the food we ordered. He tries to give us a coupon instead. I explain to him that all of my friends are out of town and I'm the closest to this place....but I live on the Westside. So he tells Melanie to send out a free creme brulee anyway, and makes it sound like it's going to be the most amazing thing ever and fix our entire night.Creme Brulee....Meh. Did not cure anything. And of course when our check came, we were charged for the creme brulee and every single messed up item. I honestly do not see why at that point why weren't comped for something, the drinks? one of our orders of garlic bread? Half a pizza? While I was in the bathroom my friends explain the situation over again and ask if we could get the coupon because we never really wanted the dessert in the first place. The manager walks over and hands the coupon to me and on the back it says, \"Sorry our vents dripped on you.\" I don't know if I'm being overly sensitive here, but that was the LEAST of the problems with that night. This seems like this was a passive-aggressive jab at us like we made a huge fuss over the vent. I don't think it was an unreasonable request to be moved to another table. We all left feeling guilty and like we had done something wrong. I would really love to come back here, but frankly I don't see how I can. I feel like I'm a marked woman and the staff and management hates all five of us. I'm sorry for the low star rating (and frankly it would have been a huge whopping one-star if Melanie hadn't have showed up). . . but the night was just too terrible to give anything more.

Eventually we got our name entered and started on the 45 minute to an hour wait for a table. But it's a Friday night, this is a hot spot, it's to be expected. Luckily there's a cool used bookstore nearby where we spent a chunk of the wait. What I absolutely love and appreciate about Masa is that there is no corkage fee! That's awesome. It's the little things, guys..The waiters are attentive usually...more on this later.Our group of 4 ordered a house salad (which was HUGE) for 7 or 8 bucks and also another appetizer that I can't remember the name of. It's basically a breaded fried risotto ball in a bed of marinara sauce. It was yummy. It kept us happy until the deep dish pizza came. Ohhh, the pizza. It was pretty fantasticular. Yep, had to make up my own word for that. It's legit deep dish, y'all. And it tastes just as good as leftovers. The \"small\" size is big enough for two big appetites. Nice for your tummy, even nicer for your wallet. It was an all-around good experience. However, the waiter gave us the wrong check, and since the other table ordered almost the same thing, we didn't double check it or think twice about it. He ran the card before realizing his mistake. So he and who I think was the owner came over and apologized for their mistake and voided the credit card transaction. Then he was like \"Yeah, could you uh, call your bank and void that so that we don't get charged any kind of fee?\" So...you messed up, and you want us to cover for you?

What i did not like about the place was the interior. It was pretty sloppy. I think one of the reason why I would not go back was because it seemed like such a crappy place to be inside. I guess they are trying to pull the original look of it all, but I was not too fond of it.

It's a bit crowded with the tables too close to each other, but the atmosphere is nice overall and is perfect for a date. I asked the waiter about vegan options and he made a point of being very clear that nothing was vegan because they used the same utensils and pans for meat dishes as for vegetarian dishes. I said I didn't mind that, but wanted to find something that was not actually made with animal products. Again, he told me that he couldn't recommend anything vegan. At this point I realized that he's probably had to deal with some pain-in-the-ass vegans before and simply asked what, as a vegetarian, I could eat that didn't have any egg, cheese, butter, etc. in it. He recommended the minestrone soup and Vege. Chixen Sandwich. My BF got the potato soup and Lilac veggie pizza (he's vege, but not vegan). Our soups arrived very quickly and were huge! We were both pretty full from the soups and fresh sides of bread, but gave the entrees a go. BF liked the pizza and I thought the sandwich was okay. It was kinda boring, but I didn't have much of an appetite by that point, so I didn't mind much.They have some decent beers and this always adds a couple of points to my reviews. BF had a Boddingtons and I had a couple of the Honey Blonde Ales (I know what you're gonna say about honey, but I don't care).Service was nice, attentive, and helpful. Food was good, but a bit pricey at $30 for each of us plus tip. I should note that they have vege pepperoni and soy cheese, but neither is vegan.

So i think, well, I can get this without the ham.. it will be ok. Wrong. It was one piece of that crap white processed \u00a0cheese they call \"swiss\" again, barely split between the two sandwich halves, some mealy tomatoes, a bunch of mayo and about 3 handfuls of chopped romaine. After scraping out all the crap, I was left with a floppy mayonnaissey croissant with a hint of weird cheese. for $8.50. Hint, offer another veggie sandwich, or at least make it look like a decent sandwich if ordered without meat. I've been a veggie for 17 years, any other cafe Ive gone to can do this.

My first journey to Masa, many years ago, was on a rainy day, when Anna swooped me up to drop us in for a afternoon snack of Masa's amazing Bread Pudding. At that time they served Murphy's Chocolate Stout, which we shared together. It was the first time in my life I had a truly amazing desert and complementing beer together. It was transforming. I always longed for that experience again.Spring ahead some 2 years later and I was working wardrobe for a small indy film called The Yellow Wallpaper. One of the Co-Stars, Dale Dickie (Winter's Bone), and I were having a little informal chat about food in LA. She then mentioned Masa to me. She did so because the owners were her close friends and she wanted to recommend a good restaurant for me to try. I immediately chimed in with own remarkable experience at Masa. The one I mentioned above. It was a charming bonding moment for us both, where I learned even more about this remarkable restaurant and eating experience.Spring ahead once again and I find myself entertaining a friend I worked with on The Yellow Wallpaper at Masa, we were filled with excitement for Dale's Oscar nominated movie, Winter's Bone, and thought it would be great to eat at the restaurant she had recommended to me so many years earlier. Matt, my house guest was thrilled as I was about this as was I about being his dinner guest on the day after the Oscar nominations. Our waitress was as sweet as she could be, hailing from Chicago herself, as does Masa's Chef. I've had many of their panini for lunches. I have on many occasions had the sumptuous Chicago Styled Pizzas and then there's the Moules et Frites: All are TDF! But tonight was going to be different. I needed to go somewhere new and explore deeper into Masa' menu. Matt was good enough to set the tone of our have celebration by ordering up some pints of their best brews. The darling and completely charming waitress was patient and really listened. I want to say that of all the places I dined, everyone who I've experienced that worked here at Masa has always put me and my friends at ease and were more that helpful. I feel the greatest comfort setting at any of their tables. They always have some wonderful and maybe, somewhat rare classic film running on their Television sets referencing Hollywood's Golden age of cinema. Viva this sort of nostalgia!Tonight it's Penne Orleans for Matt and Midwest Meatloaf for me. Matt and I split the Manchego salad, a must eat when you are at Masa. We were then served our respective meals. We shared parts of our entrees with one another because they were so tempting. Who could resist such a foodie experience! We part took of another tasty beer as we savored our delicious meals. Matt's Penne was a little spicy and far heartier than I usually consider for most pastas.The Blackened cajun spiced chicken breast mixed in the penne had a richer more savory flavor than I expected that proved surprising, hitting all the right notes. It was truly rewarding to eat. The Midwest Meatloaf, though very different than my mother's, had a tangy barbecue flare about it. The meatloaf was resting on perfectly steamed spinach was more than I could have ever expected from this traditional American fare. The roasted potatos were a really nice counter point. The slightly grilled taste in those potatos opened up the overall taste experience to this humble dish. The portion were just right for this early evening excursion.I insisted that Matt order Masa's Bread Pudding. It's the only thing I know in Los Angeles that can rival San Francisco's Tartine's Almond Crescent. I insisted he save it for later because our tummy's were already over expanded. Later, I persuaded Matt to take it with him to share with his girlfriend. I already know what a home run Masa's Bread Pudding is and I knew it would be the perfect treat to share with someone with whom you love. He went with that idea and soon a couple are going to be in Foodie ecstasy. Our waitress was just the best!

If you're ever in the area, I'd highly recommend it - blows Masa out of the water! Anyway, seems like all the reviews here runneth over with praise for the deep dish, which is notably the only place in LA that I've discovered serving this kind of pie.First experience, I called in for pickup and ordered a large deep dish VEGAN (I'm not vegan but my boyfriend is, so I cook and we eat vegan often). I thought I was ordering one of their large specialty pies and made a few modifications over the phone. Came in to pick up my order, place was moderately busy and a brunette waitress instructed me to the other side of the counter to pay (no greeting, and was very serious). I proceeded to pay for my pie, where I discovered that you cannot make modifications to pies or it otherwise then just becomes a \"build your own\" where you're charged a substantial amount for each individual topping. I asked for the manager because my total was more than the specialty pie price (my red flag that I'd been overcharged the menu noted $24 and change for a large). The manager was apologetic and offered to reimburse me because the girl who took my phone order conveniently forgot to mention this detail (NO MODIFICATIONS). This isn't an ER and it's no real biggie (afterall I work food service), so I refuse the reimbursement \u00a0and fork out approx. $50 bucks for my pie. Note to self for next time. This pie was gigantic, physically heavy, and good overall (4ppl could have comfortably eaten this one and been full - there was only two of us, could have went with a small). Another thing the girl on the phone could have mentioned...Second time around, decided to go for the 12\" thin crust VEGAN for pickup, once again. This time I'm aware that if you modify it becomes a \"build your own\" and beware can become very pricey. So I ask the female on the phone for a substitute veggie for veggie (no mushrooms, instead sub olives) - mind you I've worked in an upscale pie joint... she says, no modifications! You'll have to build your own. I now only want to take the damn mushrooms out - no subs... still no modifications. Sigh! really?! It's not brain surgery on your POS system or like I'm asking for extra vegan cheese (a specialty item that costs them more to order), no it's a vegetable for a vegetable for crying out loud. I digress, fine build the pie. I order a couple side salads to boot. I pick up the pie and the lady ringing me up was nice enough (saw the unfriendly brunette again - still unfriendly). The pie was super small, had hardly any sauce on it, red onions sparsely laid out and a minimal amount of \"teese\" cheese. My boyfriend and I agreed that this was the worst pie we've ever had! Salads were average - they could have mentioned they toss the dressing on the salad because I was driving home and lettuce tends to wilt if you don't get the dressing on the side. Common sense - take out 101.All this to say, LOVE the concept. Vegans beware the thin crust... Everyone beware the customer service and NO MODIFICATIONS. I've since ordered the coveted \"Teese\" cheese online to pursue my own pie endeavors. I won't be going back anytime soon. Happy eating!

Go and try it out. \u00a0After visiting this place three times I feel I can finally write a fair review. All three times I have been happily satisfied with the service and the food. Of the three times I went I was in a large group and we were very well accommodated. The most recent time I went I casually let the girl I made the reservation with know it was surprise birthday dinner party. When I arrived our waiter knew the details and was happy to help out in anything we needed to really surprise the birthday girl. \u00a0The waiter never failed to meet our very hungry and thirsty group of 12's needs . He did it all with a smile and a lot of energy. Too bad I didn't get his name or else I would give him a shout out.So now for the food and drinks. Manchego Salad is a great way to start your lunch or dinner there. Now the manchego isn't shredded and all mixed up in the salad like I usually like, but I can appreciate the two major slices laid on top of the salad. In the end I am very satisfied with salad. I think it would be fine for lunch but I really prefer sharing it and then sharing a pizza after. Their thin crust pizza are magnificent. They have a great selection of different toppings. I feel dumb for not remembering mine but it was soooooo good. So good you make sure that the person your sharing with it isn't creeping up on any of your slices. I know the deep dish are what they are known for but I don't really like deep dish in general. However, the people in my group did and they could not stop raving about it. I did try s little from my friend and liked it but in the end I am all about thin crust. So I am a bit bias. True, it does take long, but they let me know that when I called for a reservation and reminded me as soon as I sat down so no complaints from me on the time. \u00a0I really enjoy the Masa's Honey Blonde Ale. I am not a beer connoisseur, but I like beer and I LOVE the Honey Blonde. I always want more but usually limit myself to two. \u00a0So if I am raving about this place why not 5 stars? So two minor details. IF I could I would give them 4 and 1/2 instead of the 4. Penne Orleans is very good however it has A LOT of garlic. I am not exaggerating. I am a garlic lover but even I was like woah now. I think the next day it was seeping from my pores. So would I order it again yes but I would say hey go easy on the garlic please. Second thing is our food took a while to come out. Yes we were a large group and had great conversation and appetizers to keep us busy but the food did take a bit long. Very much worth the wait.

I don't usually eat at places that make food that I see on television nor have I ever heard the word reduction in person. When he brought the salad I told him it looked like something on \"top chef\" and we got into a ten minute discussion of restaurants and restaurant shows. This place really reeked of pretense to me. I so wanted to hate it and the food. But no, the salad was amazing. The flavors leaped off the plate and I didn't care that I about anything but the next bite. Same for the pizza. I am a big guy and usually a big eater. But I had half a salad and four small slices of pizza and I was totally satisfied. With tip, I put out about $35 and about $10 was the tip. Worth every penny and more.

I have 8 years in the food and beverage business and customer service so I would know. we ordered the artichoke dip, green mixed salad and the deep dish lots of meat in large because I wanted to take some home just incase I loved it! I loved their cuban roll, soft and warm as for the dip it was the best..for those who love FRIDAYs DIP ...you will never go back after you taste MASAS. The mixed salad we could have skipped in all honesty! Id have to say I would have been more happy with it if the dressing had more of a zing to it. I recomend getting another side like some ravioli or the motzarella sticks! I drank lemonade but beer on tap must be amazing! Once we got the deep dish pie the waitress came over and served us the first slice and had tons of good humor I loved it! the corn bread crust the best ever! the sauce is home made you can def. tell, I could taste the tomatoe pieces and the spices. We didnt get dessert but the couple next to us got the bread pudding I believe and it looked amazing! I was stuffed and so was my hubbs. The only minor detail is how they rush you out....I didnt like that, but I am guessing its becauze we were at the bar and it was busy hour....7-9pm dinner time. Next time I will call my table in for sure! total was about 50 bucks, I gave my waiter a ten dollar tip so without tip its about 20 per person for an appetizer, a salad and a large deep dish pizza thats not bad! FYI im a culinary art student and I def loved MASA keep up the good work guys!p.s come here for the deep dish its the best!!!!! some people say the pizza is like costcos....im sorry but ur taste buds are backwards! splurge and get the deep dish you got the tuna seal of approval!", "Date": "2011-03-07", "Author_Location": "Panorama City, CA"}, {"Author": "brit m.", "ReviewID": "v9mMk_vhED1FvJzrORHJXg", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "two words: deep dish.you won't regret it.", "Date": "2011-03-21", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Velma K.", "ReviewID": "UTFdJkseho_nbd4ELokAOg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been here a couple of times.

When heading eastbound on sunset while heading home, my date and I noticed how packed this place was so late at night and thought it must be a happening place (remember...I was driving in my car when I saw spotted this restaurant). So now that I was in the area, it was time to try this place.We started with what I believe was the best bread I have ever had. It was barely warm but yet so soft and delicious. We then had the potato soup which was delicious as well. We had not even had our pizza but yet, because of the young crowd, the atmophere, and such friendly employees (our female waitress was great), I made it clear that I was willing to come back again in the future. When I first saw this place while driving by it, the only words I could notice were \"bakery\" so when we finally came here, it was our intention to come only for dessert. Instead we came for the pizza and soup (we were at a small gathering that afternoon, were we had mostly salad and appetizers). Therefore, we came here for dinner and postponed the dessert. Since we were not \"starving\", we settled for the thin pizza over the famous \"chicago-style\" pizza. Though the thin \"Lilac\" pizza was fantastic, I do plan on coming back for the thick style in the near future. I could not help noticing how great it look as it was being served to others. Let's not forget the dessert that I saw. The \"bread pudding\" I saw was gigantic and was known for being the best dessert on the menu.I will definetely be coming back soon for pan pizza and dessert.

I had heard that Masa was the best place in Los Angeles for Chicago style deep dish pizza. I had also been told by many people that when you choose to eat at Masa, and if you are thinking about ordering their amazing Chicago deep dish pizza it is best to call your pizza order in about 20 minutes ahead of time because it takes them 40 minutes to bake the pizza's because of the thick corn meal crust. My girlfriend, my best friend, and I had been out furniture shopping for our new place and we needed to make a decision on what furniture we wanted to purchase. We thought we would go over all our options while we waited the 40 minutes for our pizza. We got to Masa, placed our order for the pizza and pulled out all of our notes from the furniture stores. Here is how the 40 minutes went. 5 min in- We had already narrowed it down between two places. 10 min in- My GF and I had already made up our minds on what furniture we wanted. 15 min in- My BF says \"guys I'm starving, lets get some appetizers.\" 17 min in- We place an order for mozzarella sticks and garlic bread. 22 min in- Appetizers arrive. The mozzarella sticks were super cheesy and the garlic bread was nice and crunchy. Both of these appetizers were great. 28 min in- Appetizers have already been demolished. 30 min in- We see our neighbors pizza and we all three realize that the appetizers just made us hungrier. 35 min in- My BF says \"This is excruciating, what is going on in that kitchen?\" 41 min in- We here a bell ring in the kitchen and our waitress appears with our pizza. I'm convinced that GOD was the man in the kitchen doing the cooking at Masa when we were there because only he could have created something so heavenly. This was by far the best deep dish pizza I have ever had in my life. First off the pizza is huge and the crust is at least 2-3 inches thick. The sauce (which the pizza is covered in) is fantastic. They use huge pieces of sweet sausage that taste absolutely amazing, their sausage is the best I have ever had. The buffalo mozzarella they use is also super tasty. The star of our pie was of course the crust. There is only one word I can use to describe their crust, perfect. After our dinner our waitress told us that they serve the best chocolate croissant bread pudding on earth. Even though I was so full I was intrigued by her bold statement and decided to order this dessert. Once I bite into this dessert I had no choice but to agree with her. This dessert was phenomenal. It was huge (like everything else on their menu) and was served nice and warm. The croissant BP was packed full of chocolate and almonds, words really can not describe how amazing it was. Our waitress Athena was amazing. She was a very down to earth girl. She joked around with us the whole time we were there and also told us funny stories about her, her family, and the restaurant.

I stopped eating my Gnocchi at the half way point because I had to save room for the pizza but I was waiting and waiting. All that waiting equated to picking at my gnocchi and next thing you knew I had a fourth left over. That was it! I stopped picking and snacking on the Gnocchi and finally the deep dish came out.

With our initial waiter no where to be seen, I had flagged down another waiter, and had asked for a latte. That waiter places my latte on the table, and before he leaves I ask for straws for our waters. Here comes the problem: he just throws the straws onto the table with an attitude - it wasn't as if I had asked him to dance for me. There was just no need for that. Before even deciding whether or not to post this, I had asked my bf if he had seen and felt the same...he did. The waiters attitude was very much of \"I work in echo park, and I'm too cool to be a waiter, but I am cos I'm a hipster\" As I'm talking to my bf, I start to notice how dingy and dirty the place looks. Debating whether to leave or not at this point, the bread pudding arrives. I suppose it was good timing because it was official that I knew I was not to come back and spend my $ here. The bread pudding was oozing out oil from every little pore of the breads surface. It wasn't appealing. I decided to just go ahead and eat, thinking \"it was good once.\" What I saw and what I tasted was the same. I tasted a stick of butter with a hint of chocolate. Luckily I had the latte to help glide all that butter-mush down my throat. Though I've never ordered their pizzas or other foods, I'm sure I'm not missing out anything. I will not miss their servers attitudes.", "Date": "2012-05-03", "Author_Location": "Rialto, CA"}, {"Author": "Marion L.", "ReviewID": "3NviIH4OIHPeomk4pH-Vaw", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I wish I could rate the food at Masa but as soon as we entered the door we were greeted with a surly and curt hostess who clearly couldn't handle the stress of a busy restaurant.

A few days before the date we called to adjust the reservation by a half hour and we were told on the phone that the restaurant doesn't take reservations after 8 pm on Fridays. When asked about the specific reservation policy, the hostess said \"Have you seen Masa on Friday night?!\" \u00a0I, in fact, had never been to Masa so I don't know how that response equates to a restaurant policy. Eventually she reluctantly agreed to move our reservation. When we showed up late the night of our reservation the hostess let us know we had lost our table and had to wait for something to open up (which was totally fine and definitely our fault) BUT proceeded to chide our entire party of 10 in a condescending tone that we had to get away from the bar if we weren't going to drink anything (though we were smooshed up against the bar to avoid a fire hazard by standing at the door!) Ridiculous that she's the first person we met as soon as we walked in! Her poor customer service helped us decide that our business wasn't welcome so we walked out and found another Echo Park restaurant that wanted to serve us.

The waiter was really really ridiculously friendly and had a great personality and passed all my tests. One thing I like to do is roll up straw wrappers and place them at the edge of the table.

Next time we came we had a large Chicago style pizza with spinach, pepperoni and three cheeses and a really good manchego salad. Both were DELICIOUS!!!! The salad had a nice pear sauce and all kinds of goodies in it. The pizza needs more pizza sauce though but I really love the Chicago style cornbread crust. Please note that a Chicagoan friend of my boyfriend said the pizza passes the test but that the bottom of the crust is not as thick as it should be. Probably a modification for California where people care more about how their waist looks haha!!!! The waitress was really nice and we were once again attended very well.

Really, the bread pudding is what I had my heart set on - but I was completely side tracked by the Chicago deep dish pizza - how do I go to Masa and not order the pizza? Well, there were two of us and I think it goes without question a \"small\" would have been MORE than enough - however I wanted the meat pizza (while dining with someone who doesn't eat meat) so I asked the waiter if they can make the pizza 1/2 and 1/2. He said he wouldn't suggest it but at the same time I thought to myself, who the hell can eat two small deep dish pizzas so I thought, eff it! I don't really care if a little pineapple gets cooked into my meat side - we will work it all out, not a big deal. I wish I would have known, that \u00a0the deep dish takes 40 minutes!!! I guess this is where I know I'm a NY pizza girl NOT a Chicago pizza girl. The waiter also mentioned since we were doing 1/2 and 1/2 it would be a different price - fine! again, I really didn't care but then he said he suggest doing a large instead of a small because it's only $4 more - ok, whatever! I ordered the Masa Honey Blonde Ale and we shared a Cesar salad. The Cesar was actually quite delicious. I loved the big thick slices of parm, and bacon. It was very very yummy. It's plenty enough for two people - and more than enough for one person. It's a huge meal on its on. The round warm loaf of bread they brought was so fluffy and tasty. By the time I had my beer, the salad and the bread - I was SOOOO full! I really think they should serve the pizza by the slice - because I could only manage to eat one slice. The pizza was tasty but WAY to heavy - literally - I had to take the entire thing to go and I should have weighed the the to go bags - this stuff must weigh at least 15 lbs - no joke! I also tried the Firestone Double barrel Ale - which I enjoyed more than the Blonde Ale. I was so stuffed, I couldn't possibly order the bread pudding :( which makes me really sad since that's what I wanted. If I ever do return, it will be solely to try the bread pudding and possibly have a beer but all in all I'm just a bit thrown off by how heavy this meal was. It was seriously enough food for 12 or more people not 2. If you know any really heavy eaters, send them here - they'll be satisfied!

We got the garlic bread which was really delicious. The bread was a bit chewy and slightly crunch with melty cheese and garlic on top. The bread was served with marinara that was was slightly sweet. Really tasty. We opted to order the Chicago deep dish meat lovers one with sweet Italian sausage and pepperoni. The crust was really chewy and crunchy and had really good texture. The pizza sauce had a sweet flavor to it which was a really nice touch to the pizza pie. My friend and I both had 2 slices while her bf got like 3 slices... It was soooo much food.

We had a deep dish pizza, gnocci, caesar salad, suppli (fried risotto appetizer), and the bread pudding for dessert. Every item was delicious. Staff is super friendly. A few tips in case it's your first time:-It takes 40 minutes for the deep dish pizza, so you'll need to make some quick decisions about toppings if you want to order one. We were caught off guard and had to do fast topping negotiations with our family - always tricky in my family, but may be easier with yours ;-)-The deep dish pizza is ridiculously filling. I could barely eat one piece, and I'm a three-piece kind of pizza eater ordinarily. We brought most of the pizza home as leftovers, and we couldn't believe how much the box weighed! Unless you've been fasting, one piece per person could be all you need. The waitress did warn us not to get a second pizza, bless her. -The sausage on our pizza was not little crumbly bits, but rather, a big flat wedge that covered large swaths of the pie. It's good sausage, but...like all good sausage, a little goes a long way and this was a bit much. I think next time I'll not order sausage. The pepperoni was especially delicious. -The caesar salad was big enough for four of us to share. It was one of the better caesar salads I've had in a long time, not too salty, full-size pieces of bacon, and crisp, garlicky \"croutons\" (actually thin slices of crispy bread). \u00a0Not sure if the other salads are that big.

The sausage - not quite enough on there and ehhh a bit overly flavored with anise to the point where it resembled licorice. So in future, maybe pepperoni or stick with cheese. The pizza was HUGE and the price was very reasonable. The kids are too little to appreciate dad's sense of Chicago pizza obsession, so they ordered a thin crust cheese pizza and a tuna salad panini. Both were delicious. Hey, I'm a dad. I have to sample from the kids' plates. Now why not 5 stars? Well, this was our second attempt at this place. We didn't get seated the first time. We called for reservations, but they don't do reservations for parties under 5, but they said to come on in they weren't busy, etc. and we got there, no one was at the front - no hostess nobody to let us know how long the wait was. Finally a waitress told us there was a 45 minute wait. With little ones, that's impossible. And I was kind of peeved how long we had to wait to find out there was a wait. So we left.

I also discovered that the sausage is actually a large flat \"sausage pancake\" over the marinara, with sprinkles of cheese on top. \u00a0I suppose that means less calories and what not. \u00a0The marinara was good, the cheese had its presence be known, but the sausage pancake is something I would need to get used to. \u00a0It tends to fall of while i try to bite into it, but perhaps that was because I'm not used to handling it. \u00a0The salad I had was amazing during the wait, and it was the most popular and recommended by the waitress. \u00a0Forgot what it was called though, since most of m anticipation was in the pizza. \u00a0The interior of the restaurant also reminded me of the small local neighborhood restaurants spread across Chicago with its mix and match furniture. \u00a0All in all, I give it four stars. \u00a0It's an interesting addition to the eclectic hipster gentrifying town of Echo Park.", "Date": "2012-09-18", "Author_Location": "Torrance, CA"}, {"Author": "J S.", "ReviewID": "VTTJzetvMR96oDduFYNQEg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Finally had a chance to go here.

Absolutely loved Masa. Completely charming interior. My boyfriend and I were there around 11:30, and it felt like a brunch place \u00a0(which they do serve), but I could see how it would work equally well for dinner. We were a little confused at first by the small tables. Where are they going to put our giant deep dish pizza, we wondered? Luckily they bring out handy folding tables where all your food sits, leaving your whole table open for enjoying the food. Smart. I hate those places that use the metal pizza holders that sit right on the table and block the view of the person you came with. This was way more convenient.Being 11:30, I decided to get a latte (which was excellent), but it seemed like they had a nice beer selection as well. Definitely coming back for dinner next time. We started with the mixed greens salad, which was perfectly dressed, and contained only scallions and tomatoes, so you could really taste the delicious greens, which I love. Also, the portion was huge! For $7 I was expecting a small side salad plate, but we got plenty to share. They also bring out a little loaf of warm bread and butter. By the time the pizza arrived, I was feeling pretty content, but decided to dive in anyway. That was a good decision because this is by far the best deep dish pizza I have had so far in LA. Being from Chicago, I am pretty particular about pizza, and while Masa certainly isn't \"traditional\" Chicago-style deep dish, I loved everything they changed about it. They crust was a really tasty and a perfect thickness (not so hard and thick that you're breaking your teeth on it), and the layer of cheese was just enough (not so much that you feel like you're going to have a heart attack after one bite). It was topped with a great chopped tomato sauce and we got the \"California Style\" which also came with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes, which I'd never thought of having on a deep dish pizza, but turned out to be a great new addition. Definitely had to take home left-overs, but they heated up just as good the next day (and boy was I looking forward to them!)After reading the reviews, I wasn't expecting much from Masa in the way of good service, so I was completely blown away with how attentive they were to us. At least 5 different people had a hand in checking on us, bringing us refills, delivering out food etc, and our server was very nice and helpful. Everyone was really laid back and seemed to enjoy working there. I overheard another group as they were walking in, and the woman was telling her party how much she just loves this place, and it felt like every customer in the restaurant was giving off that \"I just love coming here\" vibe.

I have yet to try breakfast but I'm sure it's not disappointing. Love the decor, punctual and friendly service (except this one crazy chick but we will discuss later). They have great marinara sauce that tastes like mom's, the fresh Cuban bread that is a party in the mouth, and pizzas, pastas and salads. The dishes are simple yet the taste is so abundantly flavorful. My favorite dishes are: caesar salad, lasagna, fries, and the fresca a la siciliana. All the salads are very delicious here. They know how to dress, caress and cuddle those leafy greens. One thing I cannot stand are over-dressed salads.

The food was amazing not a large selection of wine and beer, but i wont take points off because they have the essentials. I can honestly say this pizza is the best i've ever had. (im not professing to be a pizza connoisseur, but ive tried a few other places) The deep dish is amazing and you have the option of building your own custom pizza. My friends and i decided to try basil, sun dried tomatoes, and chicken. We had no idea how that would turn but much to our surprise, it was fantastic. The service was awesome, and the workers were extremely friendly and attentive. Unfortunately we didnt try anything besides the pizza and wine because we got there near closing time, but mostly because of our limited budget. A bottle of wine and A large custom pizza was plenty for the 4 of us and the bill was $50. Yup thats right a bangin restaurant dinner with a bottle of wine for $12.50 per person. Id say thats a deal. The size of the large pizza was average, but because of the deep dish style its almost like 2 pizzas stacked on each other. We all left extremely full and still had some leftover. I definitely recommend this spot for anyone with an empty stomach, and if you're looking for a place to eat after a dodger game this place is literally down the street. Just a heads up, i dont dock points because of the crowd it draws, but if you know Echo Park, then you know that it's become hipster-central in the past few years.

I am the biggest deep dish pizza snob in the world, routinely having deep dish fedexed in from Chicago to satisfy my cravings. So, I approached my first visit to Masa with a \"prove it to me\" attitude. This is my impartial finding; I was very impressed. The crust is thick, yet light and flakey, less oilly than their Chicago based counterparts. The crust was actually thin on the bottom, yet still crunchy. The crushed plum tomatoes were awesome. Please, people, deep dish pizza is not slathered with sauce, its merely fresh, crushed sweet plum tomatoes, period. No \"sauce\". The cheese was spot on, able to handle the pull easily with big strands needing to be cut like string. The sausage was the most interesting part. A heavy dose of fennel, at first, this was the part of the pie tha was most different from the usual Chicago deep dish. Less greasy than just a layer of sausage, the fennel grows on you and tastes great the next day cold.
