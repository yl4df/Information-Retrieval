Didn't have a reservation so we arrived nice and early and had no trouble being seated in the dining room. Highlights were the trio of ceviche and the chocolate cake. Also had the chillies relleno - delicious. The food was, as you can expect, solid. But more enjoyable was the unassuming air in the bustling restaurant. Very relaxed. They have every right in the world to be snobs - and they are not. We met the utterly enchanting manager, Kyle who was kind enough to spend time at our table and tell us about their most recent Mexico trip. He is wonderful! Our server, Diego was also great! Awesome recommendations and he handled a crazy situation with grace (the people at the table next to us came there and only had 20 minutes for dinner. Who does that at Frontera?). Finally, solid cocktails. Jay is a pro - knowledgable and very fun to watch. Believe the hype.

The best item on the menu is from Topolobampo. First, we ordered guacamole. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. More importantly, we were served cold and stale chips. I initially thought that the chips were just bad, but then we were given more and the second batch were warm and not stale. I guess our first batch was old. We then shared the mole enchiladas. They had a great flavor but were also cold. I ended with the Topolobampo chicken tortilla soup. Finally something on the menu was flavorful and up to par with what I expect from a Bayless restaurant. The restaurant is overlooked for two reasons: the ambience is uncomfortable and rushed, and the experience has an overall lower quality than either Xoco or Topolobampo. First, the ambience is so odd. The room is crowded and so loud that it's hard to hear anyone. Also, I have to admit that the experience is really undermined by the fact that you are sitting next door to two of the best restaurants in Chicago. (That's right, Topolobampo and Xoco are amazing. I highly recommend checking them out.) This brings me to my next point. If you've been to either Xoco or Topolobampo, then you've come to expect great things from Bayless (and justifiably so). Both of his other restaurants are all around wonderful. Unfortunately, Frontera just doesn't offer the same quality experience. As I mentioned above, barring the Topolobampo soup, the food isn't great. Furthermore, the ambience is not enjoyable. Being from Ann Arbor, Michigan, I'd rather go to Isalita over Frontera Grill. The takeaway: Frontera Grill feels like it's just been left to ride its reputation.

Well we're fans of his TV show, his books, and his cooking philosophy. \u00a0However, his restaurant was very disappointing on our last visit.We've visited Frontera twice, once 5 years ago back when Rick was still cooking at the the restaurant and again last week during the National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago. I'm not sure if Rick still cooks at the restaurant or not, but we were not impressed.Here's a summary of our experience:RESERVATION:We had a reservation for a party of 10 people that we had confirmed weeks ago for dinner. We arrived to the restaurant 30 mins early know that it's a busy place, but we wanted to make sure that our table would be ready on time. It wasn't! \u00a0Although we had a reservation we had to over an hour for our table. \u00a0I felt as though we were being treated as an inconvenient \"walk-in' group, not a group that had booked and confirmed our reservation ahead of time.AMBIANCE:Love the art work and the colors, but this is one of the loudest restaurants that I have ever been to. It's virtually impossible to have a conversation with people in your group without yelling. \u00a0Rick, if you read this, you need to invest in hiring an acoustic treatment specialist to assess your restaurant and provide you with options to reduce the sound. It will make it a much more pleasant experience for your customers and your staff. \u00a0Besides, exposing your employees and yourself to loud decibels on a daily basis is a work safety hazard. FOOD:Well, 5 years ago the food was OK. This year, it was a mostly thumbs down. The guacamole, chips and salsa were great, but over priced. $10 for a scoop of guac. is pretty steep. Since it took the restaurant over an hour, they comp'd our guacamole.The tortilla soup was good, but too salty and the rest of the food was pretty, but frankly speaking shouldn't be called Mexican. Nor was is good. \u00a0The mole enchiladas were dry, the steaks were not cooked as ordered. They were either over-cooked or under-cooked. No one really enjoyed the food.Coming from Los Angeles with a group that is part American-Mexican, we expected to get great Mexican food at Rick's restaurant. \u00a0Rick's recipes and his packaged supermarket products are usually great, but the stuff they served at his restaurant were ....... let's just say there's a lot of work that needs to be done. \u00a0SERVICE:A part from the reservation and check-in experience, the service was pretty good.I truly wish I had a better review for Mr. Bayless. He seems to be a genuinely nice man and I wish that others have a much better experience than we did.

I went to Frontera and stood in line on a Wednesday night before they opened at 5:20pm, and it was quite exciting, like I was waiting in line for a concert. Oh, the anticipation! The people in the line were all excited, anxious and asking questions, like \"Have you ever been here before?\" \"They open at 5:20, right?\". Then when they opened the door, everyone in line was seated really quickly. The restaurant was full in about 20 minutes. I've never seen anything like it. They have this system down to a science. The food & margaritas are all very good. Anything you get will be good. There are several varieties of margaritas - I had the Meyer Lemon (the seasonal special) and the Classic - I think that I preferred the Meyer Lemon but both were good. The smoked chicken taquitos (appetizer) were the best thing I've eaten in a long time. I could have probably ordered 3 orders of those and had them as my dinner. After I tasted it, I stopped my friend in mid-sentence to talk about how amazing they were. You CAN'T miss the smoked chicken taquitos. I also tried the Plantain Tlacoyos (corn masa ovals with plantains and black beans), which were very tasty. The Oxacan-style Carne Asada was truly outstanding. I don't eat steak very often, but this steak was so flavorful - it had a smoky flavor to it, and I enjoyed every bite. I would definitely get it again.

I had the CHAMPAGNE MARGARITA, I don't doubt any of the said ingredients or added orange liqueur.

Any out-of-towners should place this at the top of your must-do list.

Everyone else can rave about things like margaritas (I had way more than \"several\") and mole (of course it's good, what a silly question) and guacamole (sooooo fresh) but I am here to talk about oysters and ribs.But first- the six of us got there and there was a 2 1/2 hour wait. That's ok, we went to the bar, we found 4 chairs, 4 of us sat, 2 of us stood, and soon a nearby couple left and then voila, we all had a seat. And it took all of 30 minutes. So don't fret.We ordered the guacamole. Of course it is good. Again, what a silly question.We ordered oysters. Yup. Oysters. If you like oysters, then get these. It is such a nice change from the usual horseradish and cocktail sauce. These come with a tomatillo-habanero sauce and when was the last time you had that with your oysters? It is not too spicy, but it is flavorful and really terrific with the oysters. And, if you think it is toooooo spicy, just order another margarita or two. One way or another, you'll be fine.Ribs: Did you know \"costillas\" in Spanish also means \"girlfriend\"? Neither did I, but now I do and now I have a new girlfriend. These are slathered in Chipotle and they are spicy. Yup, for sure you'll need two or three margaritas with these. They are unbelievably good and are the Saturday special. So, if you are here on a Saturday, have at least one person in the group get these. You won't be disappointed.Lastly: Get the Shrimp in Chilpachole.

And it most certainly did.Let me just start off by saying that my expectations were high since I just spent a week in the Yucatan region and had dined on some of the best Mexican food I've had in my life. But Bayless's reputation as someone who strives to incorporate real regional flavors and recipes in his dishes remains intact with me. I thought the food was really excellent, if not quite as inventive as Topolobampo or as exquisitely delicious as the authentic dishes we had in Mexico. The mole enchiladas I tried were the second best mole dish I've ever had (second to the Red Iguana in Salt Lake City). The guacamole was excellent. The garlic shrimp my wife ordered were super yummy.

But secretly, I was curious and a bit jealous. What would drive these normally sane people to stand and wait to eat Mexican food for hours? This question immediately popped in my head when we stopped by after 10pm on a Friday night to check the wait time. I was not very hungry, but when the hostess told us \"35 minutes,\" I couldn't say no.Dinner service stops at 11pm, but I never felt rushed in the service we received (service was excellent), even being seated past 10:30pm. I looked over the menu, but was immediately conflicted, I wanted EVERYTHING. After deliberation with the group, here is what was decided on. \u00a0Ceviche Trio (Frontera/Tropical Tuna/Yucatecan) - all three of the samplers were delicious. My favorite was the Tropical Tuna, which was more like a guacamole with tuna rather than a traditional ceviche. The other two were more like traditional ceviche and were both delicious (but harder to distinguish between). If you don't know which ceviche to choose, definitely get this sampler. Street Trio (Potosinas/Molotes/Sopes) - I was a bit indifferent on the two meat offerings. But the fried cheese (potosinas) were really a stand out. They were delicious. The molotes and sopes were OK, but I didn't find them game changing. Tortilla Soup - this was flat out delicious. The avocado, the tortilla strips, the cheese, down to the hot broth. We nearly licked the bowl clean. Duck Breast with Tamarind & Ancho - The duck breast was tender and not overly seasoned. It was great complimented with the crispy tamarind and mole sauce the surrounded it. Very good. Friday Special (Suadero) - This was a 20 hour cooked brisket, that melted as soon as it jumped in my mouth. The dark mole sauce was great and it was flavorful, but not overpowering to the point where I couldn't eat it by itself. Definitely good. Mushroom Cazuela - this corn, mushrooms, and spices mixture was delicious. A little small, but it really was a great addition to everything else we ate. Green Beans - just normal garlic green beans, but they were prepared well and fit in well to provide a break from all the heavy flavors. Duo de Flanes - I don't really remember much of this dish. I think it was a bit overshadowed by the tres leches, but I think it was still a good offering. Tres Leches - I really enjoyed this dessert (even though we didn't finish it). It has pomegranate seeds on top with a berry filling with whipped cream all around. It was not too sweet, and let the fruit taste really come through. Very enjoyable experience. One thing I really didn't enjoy was the tortilla. I think it really didn't provide much for me and came out a bit cold. I tried one with the mole and ended up tossing the rest. Frontera Grill really hit the spot for me. It lived up to its hype and made me into a fan. The food selection was exciting, even if not all the items were spectacular. The food is flavorful but not overpowering while having great textures and presentation. I will definitely come again (hopefully not to a long wait).", "Date": "2014-02-04", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Pui C.", "ReviewID": "xk-DgdTd4IpXh6wIKrpl8w", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The food was not bad.

I always order east coast oysters, but now have a profound new favorite. The cerviche was on point as well. The tuna/mango/guacamole cerviche deemed extremely creative and delicious. 2. Guacamole- It is incredibly easy to screw up guac, but Frontera passes the test with flying colors. Perfect blend of salt, cilantro, lime juice, red onion, and tomato. The avocados were fresh and the taste showed that off nicely.3. 3 Mole Sampler- I would consider myself vetted in Mexican cuisine, especially in the realm of mole. Needless to say, this was my most anticipated dish. Though the flavors were there, the meat was rather dry and tough to chew.

If we had to wait an hour or two I think I would have been irate when the $400 bill arrived because everything was so terribly mediocre. First, as for drinks, the little novelty where the margaritas are mixed at the tables is lame and pandering. I felt like I was in Epcot center. And, who serves margaritas in tiny martini glasses? Also, shouldn't the servers ask if we want the drinks on the rocks, w/ or w/o salt? Whether they should or they shouldn't, the feeling I got was that they didn't care. The service was rushed, with waiters and helpers tossing the plates on the table regardless of drinks and things in the way, and spitting out a fast explanation of what was what and running away. They did take their time to upsell us on everything though -- more drinks, more desserts, more after-dinner drinks -- asking many many times.A lot of folks seem to talk about the margaritas but they were too sweet in my opinion no real umph, just like the food which was completely blah. No real spice or deep flavor.

I not only did I leave still feeling hungry, I also wasn't all that impressed with the rich \"authentic\" Mexican flavors Mr. Bayless always talks about.

After chowing down on those, I wasn't starving, so I ordered the tortilla soup and roasted chicken taquitos. The taquitos were a really small serving (I think there were maybe 4 or 5 of them) held together with more guac - YUM! The tortilla soup was served in a bowl with the crisps and onions and cheese, and then the broth was poured over it in front of us - SO yummy!

One night at work, down in the pressroom waiting to check on a page, I was chatting with the press guy. He told me he'd just celebrated his wedding anniversary at a fancy downtown Mexican restaurant. It was the first time I heard about Rick Bayless and his little empire at the corner of Clark and Illinois.Fast forward through job changes, a wedding, several moves and to now... our five-year wedding anniversary. We've eaten at XOCO several times and Topolo is out of our price range comfort zone, but Frontera? We can swing that.When going to well-known restaurants like this, there seems to be a danger that it will be overhyped. Thank god, Frontera completely lived up to our expectations. Rick Bayless is a freaking genius.We arrived in line about 4:30 on a Saturday, and I ran around the corner to XOCO to grab some hot chocolate to combat the chill (I would like to suggest this, you can get to-go items at XOCO quite quickly). A short time later they opened the hallway door and started taking names and handing out buzzers. We were told we'd be seated at 5:40 in the main dining room. At 5, the bar doors opened and we were let in, and sure enough our buzzer went off right after 5:40.We decided on a small-plates style dinner. Here's what we had and notes:Drinks -- husband had the Goose Island Marisol; I had JJ's Elixir: Fig-infused Riverboat rye whiskey, cinnamon agave, fresh lime, JK Scrumpy's hard cider. \u00a0 -- Strong, warm, delicious, a perfect fall cocktail.Fall Guacamole: Pickled jalapenos, grilled local apples, homemade fresh cheese. Tortilla chips. \u00a0-- a perfect starter, creamy, a little bite but not very spicy, delicious. Street Food Trio: Two pieces each: potosinas (fresh cheese, avocado, crema, Tamazula), tlacoyos (red chile beans, guajillo salsa, cincho cheese), sopes (shredded beef, roasted tomato, green chile). \u00a0 -- each bite was better than the next. I think the potosinas were my favorite bite, the combination of cheese, crema, guacamole and hot sauce was just divine. Fresh Corn Tamales: Banana leaf-steamed sweet corn tamales, homemade crema & fresh cheese, poblano. \u00a0-- super sweet, with just the right hint of saltiness and creamy fresh cheese. Smoked Pork Queso Fundido: Otter Creek organic cheddar, guajillo-rubbed smoked pork, grilled knob onions, guajillo salsa. -- very rich, the pork was tender and so delicious, the cheese tangy, served with fresh corn tortillas.While it didn't seem like a *ton* of food, we were happily pretty full at this point, and decided to cap our evening with a little ice cream -- the homemade Mexican vanilla with goat's milk caramel. It was divine. We both agreed we could've happily drunk a glass of the caramel, which had tangy and smokey notes next to the traditional caramel profile.

I have been a huge fan of his since my teens (having purchased the Frontera Grill line of salsas and hot sauce growing up), and now I can finally say that I've tasted his amazing food first hand. And perhaps die a happy gal, too.Seriously, though, the food at Frontera Grill is unlike that I've ever had at any Mexican restaurant in the past. Trust me, I've had my share of authentic Mexican food. While Bayless' food isn't exactly 100% authentic by any means, it is absolutely perfect because he embraces the most pronounced flavors and nuances about Yucatan cuisine and elevates it to a whole other level. Everything here is sophisticated in terms of flavors and execution, yet still approached for the everyday diner. Knowing that Frontera Grill can get awfully packed during peak dining hours, the bf and I popped in for Saturday brunch a little after 10:30am. It was a good thing we came early, because a massive line had already congregated in the waiting area as we were leaving just before noon. The brunch menu is also a very affordable way to experience Bayless' food, as most menu items fell within $6 to $20. Portions were incredibly generous as well, unlike most other semi-nice restaurants operated by celebrity chefs.- Bajio-style eggs: I ordered this very brunchy dish consistinz of two perfectly poached eggs in crispy masa boats, black beans, and homemade chorizo in a creamy green poblano sauce. The poblano sauce was smooth and just slightly creamy, impressively balanced with a delicate hint of spice that didn't overwhelm the rest of the ingredients. I really loved that the masa cakes had some body, really holding up to the sauce and toppings. The eggs were impeccably poached as well, with the whites just slightly coddled but not completely solidified. It was all around a fine dish, and definitely one of the best egg dishes I've had in a while.- Enchiladas with steak & eggs: this was the bf's entree choice, mostly because it seemed a little more appropriate for brunch than the more popular chicken enchiladas with mole. He really liked the flavor of the dish, especially as he normally isn't a fan of enchiladas due to the oftentimes overly watery and bland sauce. The roasted tomato-serano chile sauce lightly ladled over these bad boys were nothing like that - the red sauce was flavorful and complex and nothing short of amazing. Even I enjoyed the tender and flavorful steak wrapped inside the fresh corn tortillas, as beef normally doesn't appeal to me nor does tough preparations of carne asada.Besides our stellar brunch entrees, our friendly waitress was also kind enough to bring a small dish of Chef Bayless' famous mole to try. The dark mole was so complex and robust in flavor that even one tiny spoonful was enough to send my tastebuds into overdrive. I could've sworn that the cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, and various seeds and spices were doing the cha-cha in my mouth. Everything about my first experience at Frontera Grill was magnificent.

A few gripes about our waitress that night: she forgot about us several times, making us having to flag her down every time we needed to order a drink; I kept getting whipped in the face with her long pig tails every time she came in to check on the table next to us; and she couldn't pronounce the basic items on the menu in Spanish which was pretty annoying.FoodI love chile rellenos and it is a treat to eat them since they are pretty time-consuming to make and my past attempts have produced some not-so-good results. So unless my mom is cooking, I rarely get to indulge. I had heard great things about the chiles rellenos at Frontera, including that they sell out quickly so I was excited to try this off the menu.They certainly did not disappoint - try them! The salsa was very flavorful and not as spicy, but the poblano pepper had a bit of kick for the perfect spice level. My favorite was the filling; the ground pork had great texture due to slivered almonds and had great flavor. The batter was light and fluffy, not greasy which is very common.OverallHad a good experience here, but honestly, not sure I'd be willing to wait in a line for 2+ hours (if you don't have a reservation & those have to be made far in advance) when you can get some quality Mexican food elsewhere with way better service. The reputation of this place I think far exceeds the food, as I found the rest of the menu (save the chiles) a bit uninspiring.

Appetizers- Frontera Guacamole- nice and fresh and full of lime! Keep it at the table to top off your entrees.Herb Green Ceviche- big chunks of yellowtail in lime juice and it's green! This was excellent. Look for the Ceviche Trio served in cocktail glasses if you're in the mood to try a few.Entrees-Mole Trio- I love moles, and being able to try three at once was awesome. The current offering was a mole poblano enchilada, the pork coloradita, and roasted vegetables in green mole. The coloradita and the mole poblano were the best of the three. Our server Charles was great all night! I have no idea what the official name of the dish my dining partner ordered but Charles suggested a chicken dish on polenta for her, that was absolutely amazing. Since it was my birthday, my dining partner had conferred with Charles to do something special for dessert. Our Sopa de Frutas with rhubarb, pineapple and a sweet red broth had \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate on the side. What a nice touch. The dessert was refreshing and really sweet.

I've only recently begun watching Top Chef, and frankly I couldn't care less about all the \"celebrity chefs.\" If there is one thing that I care most about, it is simply the food. Since one of the my favorite foods is Mexican, I was immediately intrigued. It was time to bust out of my Taco Tuesday rut.We made a visit here for dinner on a recent trip to Chicago. Forget reservations, we arrived shortly after their 5pm opening and the place was already packed with people in their business suits and corporate attire. Half hour later, we're seated in the outdoor patio area, enjoying the ambiance of honking cars and ambulance sirens.Service was casual and pleasant, but we get right down to the food. All the starters looked good, so we ended up with the appetizer platter, a sampling of guacamole, empanadas, ceviche, and jicama salad. It was a good way to try a bit of everything. The much-talked about guacamole was a bit overpowering with the citrus flavors. The jicama salad was very crisp and refreshing with a hint of tartness.For the entrees, I had the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena, while my wife had the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. There's little doubt who is star of that enchilada dish. I couldn't help myself from reaching over to taste that mole. Bayless said that it took him over 20 years to perfect his mole recipe. I believe it. There is a complex mixture of flavors in the mole that's just tough to duplicate, and they all work in unison.As for my dish, what stands out the most is the bold flavors of the spicy red chile on the ribeye steak. Marinated, wood-grilled, ultra juicy and tender, it was the perfect compliment to the side of sweet plantains. That meat really packed a punch. With a side of soft handmade tortillas and a slathering of guacamole, I built my very own carne asada tacos. Very expensive, $29 carne asada tacos.With the recommendation of our waiter, we finished it all off with a slice of chocolate pecan pie, with a healthy dollop of Kahlua whipped cream and chocolate sauce on the side. The dessert was good, but not quite on the level of goodness from those entrees we had earlier. My margarita was so-so as well.

The Manhattans in Chicago are made with Templeton Rye, Al Capone's whiskey of choice. It's a 100% gangsta choice of a cocktail and very much Chicago. Make no mistake and it goes down smooth.The menu at Frontera Grill recently changed and has more small plates now made for sampling and sharing. This was perfect as we had pre-eaten at Xoco while we were passing the 1 and a half hour wait. Everything we had was fantastic. I'd definitely return to try more things. The spices were very prominent without overwhelming any aspect of the dishes. It all tasted very fresh and as if they had been stewing all day in the kitchen.We tried the Beef-and-Poblano Tamal, Mole Trio, and Fresh Corn Tamales. It was a nice balance of dishes as we had some sour flavors as well as savory and sweet. I was most impressed with the trio of moles as it had the most common one I was familiar with (dark sauce) and a new one I found quite tasty and a nice alternative to all things heavy with meat: the epazote (roasted vegetables in pumpkinseed mole).Frontera Grill is a large restaurant with a large crowd and long wait.

A lined had formed and we were one of the last ones to get into the line that was INSIDE the restaurant. If we had waited any longer...we would have had to stand outside in the cold. Moments later, a nice young man came around and took our names and offered us our choice of times & dining - bar area or main dining. We opted for the bar...b/c we were starving and wanted to get seated sooner. We grabbed a couple of cocktails - the flor martini - organic vodka, St. Germaine and fresh grapefruit juice. It was refreshing and more importantly - strong. We didn't hold back and ordered plenty of offerings - crab claws, a tamal, chips, ceviche and a pork dish. Everything was amazing and beautifully presented. The crab claws were delicious and the accompaniments were perfect. The tamal de puerco was so flipping tasty. Bacon corn masa filled with pork, red chile sauce and a pineapple mojito salsa. I wish I had one right now. My friend's ceviche was SO good as was the escabeche. I ordered up the Puerco en Clemole Castellano - roasted pork loin served with butternut squash mash, greens with candied chile spiced pecans & bacon, and nutty smokey mole sauce. Divine. The homemade tortillas are heaven and I might have used one or two to sop up that mole sauce. I also could not resist the Topolo margarita which I would gladly drink by the pitcher.

So good, but you have to eat it quickly while it stays hot.Tamal Churriqueso- a corn masa tamal with hoemmade chorizo, avocado, queso cheese. This was a soft and creamy tamal. The flavors were sweet and delicate which was nice bc the other dishes are bolder.Queso Fundido de Milanesa- All I can say is that I like fried breaded crispy pork in cheese! It comes in cute iron skillet with fresh tortillas and two kinds of hot sauces (red and green). Very rich, but dee-lish.Grass-Fed Organic Grilled Ribeye Steak- This was sooo good!

Rick Bayless is a sheer genius. In case you didn't know, this is his flagship restaurant. I was completely looking forward to trying this place and it lived up to ALL my expectations! Four words: BEST. MEXICAN. FOOD. EVER.Here's what we ordered:Drinks--*Scarlet wave - fresh squeezed limeade floating with jamaica flower tea (iced, tangy tea of crimson Jamaica flowers) w/ dash of peychaud*Tangerine mojito - aromatic honey tangerines, d'aristi yucetan rum, lime, fresh mint.Both drinks were unique and refreshing! I felt like I was in heaven :)Appetizers--*Trio, trio, trio - three ceviches (see below for more detail)Ceviche Fronterizo (lime-marinated hawaian albacore with tomatoes, olives, cilantro, green chile; on crispy tostados)The lime was excellent and strong! Cilantro flavor was wonderful! You could tell it had been marinated for hours!!!Ceviche Yucateco (steamed mexican blue shrimp and calamri, lime, orange, habanero, avocado, jicama, cilantro w/ crispy tortilla chips)A nice sweet tang from the orange, but not overpowering. More subtle than the ceviche froterizo, but incredible on it's own. A beautiful twist on a classic!Coctel de Atun Tropical (sashimi-grade Hawaiian big eye tuna, avocado-tomatillo guacamole, tangy mango-grapefruit salsa).Tasted exactly like an ahi tartare. Not your typical ceviche. Probably the least exceptional of the trio. As with all three, the meat was incredibly fresh.Topolobampo tortilla soup - dark broth flavored with pasilla, grilled chicken, avocado, hand-made jack cheese, thick cream and crisp tortilla chips.Nothing really stood out. The dark broth makes it unique, but I can't quite put my finger on what that taste is. The flavor is quite mysterious and not really my preference, but it was still good. Sopes Rancheros - crispy corn masa boats, savory shredded beef, roasted tomato, avocado, homemade fresh cheese.The beef was oh-so-savory and the roasted tomato sauce was slightly spicy, but wonderfully juicy like a fresh tomato. The unique Masa boats had a great crunch and pleasantly held up well against the juicy broth.Meal--Falda asada \"brava\"- spicy serrano-marinated grassfed tall grass flank steak, salsa huevona (hand-crushed, grill-roasted tomatoes, jalapenos), grilled knob onions, sweet corn tamales with crema and fresh cheese.The tamales were unexpectedly sweet in a good way. The meat perfectly undercooked. The salsa was crazy addicting and a bit insanely spicy, but I loved it. The onions were sweet. Everything complimented each other nicely, especially the handmade tortillas! Ole!Dessert--Pastel de chocolate, cacahuate y mango - silky chocolate ganache cake, crunchy candied pecans, height-of-season mango, toasted peanut ice cream.This dessert looks like a torte. They claimed the mango was at the height of the season, but it tasted freaking sour! Nonetheless, I still think some fruit was necessary to balance out the oversweetened taste of the chocolate. I loved the extra salty nuts against the super sweet ganache, plus the cooling effect of the ice cream. It was a good dessert, but I've definitely had better.Can I just say...the service here is exceptional!!!! They don't rush you, they make recommendations to you, and the servers are actually Mexican, so they know what they're talking about! It's funny because the atmosphere is quite kick-back and low-key in many ways, but the incredible food and attentive service makes you feel like you're at a fine dining restaurant! At the same time, the place is very homey, feels extremely authentic, and makes me want to go to Mexico.

I've been a fan of Bayless since the early 2000s when I avidly watched his cooking show on PBS that was introduced to me by my roommate of Mexican descent. I fell in love with his dishes and his genuine enthusiasm for Mexican cuisine. With him, Mexican food became more than rice and refried beans. It was elevated to haute cuisine and celebrated the way French and Italian cuisine is celebrated in the finest restaurants in the US. A few years later, I decided to go to Chicago to visit a friend and he fulfilled my dream of dining at Frontera Grill. The food was sublime and I was eager to go back.Thanks to a conference I had a trip to Chicago planned and paid for.Naturally Frontera Grill was my first destination.We started with GUACAMOLE and freshly-made tortilla chips. Theguacamole was smooth and creamy, dotted with cubed tomatoes and diced onions. But what really made this were the freshly-made tortilla chips. Warm and fresh, and deliciously salty, they elevated this to a whole new level.We thought it would be more fun to get a bunch of little appetizers to share, which turned out to be the right idea as we got to try a bunch of different things. I swear each one was a perfect little bite. STREET FOOD TRIO: Two pieces each: potosinas (fresh cheese, avocado, crema, Tamazula), pork flautas (guajillo salsa, peashoots), sopes (shredded beef, roasted tomato, green chile). I loved everything, but especially the sopes. The shredded beef was amazing! MOLE POBLANO ENCHILADAs: Gunthorp free-range chicken, grill-roasted red onions. \u00a0I thought I hated mole sauce. No, it turns out that when it's made correctly, I *love* mole. There was a deep rich flavor that was accented by a hint of cacao. Other mole sauce had tasted as if people accidentally dropped a batch of chocolate into the sauce, but not at Frontera. I wanted more.TACOS AL CARBON: Wood-grilled chicken, roasted poblano rajas, guacamole, two salsas. Yum, nothing like tacos to fill up whatever little empty corners of your stomach. For dessert, we got DUO DE FLANES: A duo of caramel custards: classic Mexican vanilla bean & Gentle Breezes honey with Bayless Garden lemon verbena. Honey-poached apricot & honeycomb candy.

Though we barely put a dent in the menu, we liked what we saw and first impressions matter most.My gal pal wasn't feeling up to a full meal and ordered the Jicama Cellejera ($4.50), which was an appetizer-sized portion of sliced cucumbers and jicama dusted with achiote, lime, and pineapple juice. Some of the jicama pieces on top were doused with the overpowering spiciness and GC ate all of the pineapple pieces before I could try the dish in its entirety. My incomplete verdict is to render the dish nothing too special, though the combination of peppery achiote, tangy sweet pineapple, and tart lime was interesting.Each summer Bayless' chefs take a one-week reprieve from the restaurant to go on a work-related, culinary research excursion. This year they made it down to the Yucatan--where the cosmopolitan cuisine takes notes from both Mexican and Western influences--and came back with an amendment of especialidades for the menu.For JH and I, this meant a traditional achiote grilled fish or Pescado Tikin Xik ($17), served with a roasted tomato-habanero salsa, Mexican rice, and pea tendrils. \u00a0Warm corn tortillas were brought on the side. Achiote paste is a common marinade found in Yucatean cuisine and is a combination of annatto (what gives it its fiery red color), cumin, oregano, garlic, pepper, cloves, cinnamon, and allspice. \u00a0 The banana-leaf grilling method led to an incredibly moist and succulent filet of mahi mahi, while the achiote rub gave it a deep smoke and pepperiness. There was added heat from the habanero in the salsa, while the acidity in the tomatoes cooled it all down. \u00a0The Mexican rice was aromatic with notes of ancho chile powder and the pea tendrils was crisp and lightly dressedThe dish was both my friend and foe--enraging my taste buds at first and soothing them after.

So when this Mexicana from California knew I was Chicago-bound, I told my boyfriend we had to eat at Frontera Grill and pay homage to one of my fav chefs. That said, my expectations were really high, after all, it's Rick Bayless! I started with a house margarita at the bar to pass the time since it was a 1 1/2 hour wait (tip: make reservations) and when they brought my $9 margarita in what could pass as a \u00a0kid's sippy cup I knew we were going to have problems. I snorted my margarita and quickly asked for a Tecate (thinking they had it on tap, like any good high-end Mexican restuarant) and the disappointment continued when they brought it to me IN A CAN with no frosty glass (hey Rick, they do have Tecate in bottles, you know). Ghetto (never thought I'd use ghetto and Frontera Grill in the same sentence...)We found a high (and super small)-table at the bar and since they serve the full menu there we decided to by-pass the 1 1/2 hour wait and just eat at the bar.We next ordered their carnitas taquitos appetizer hoping for redemption. They, along with their chips and two salsas were EXCELLENT. Redemption was found -- but only for a second.Our main courses came. I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas because mole is a complex sauce and can tell me a lot about the authenticity of a Mexican restaurant. The mole was good -- but it wasn't my grandmother's mole, that's for sure. I couldn't narrow down the spice that I felt overwhelmed the sauce -- it was either cumin or coriander. Whichever one it was, there was too much of it and I couldn't taste the infusion of chocolate and peanut butter that you're supposed to taste in a great mole. The plating was also very disappointing. They served the 3 enchiladas (which I have to admit was a very hefty portion, so that was good) with a heap of dried refried black beans. Boo! My boyfriend ordered the \"tacos al carbon\" and the irony was that HE didn't even know of Rick Bayless and was annoyed I was going to make him wait 1 1/2 hours for seating (but we bypassed that by sitting at the bar), yet his meal was the only hit of the night. The meat was very tasty and credit must be given to the amazing caramelized onions that brought out the flavor of the meat. His meal also came with some really good \"frijoles borrachos\". The tortillas were also very good, almost like my grandmothers. Neither of our meals came with rice so we ordered a side. It was the ONLY thing that I was tempted on sending back. I thought it was just me, but my boyfriend -- also a bone fide Mexican who grew up on Mexican food -- thought it was, how did he put it? Nasty. \u00a0Again, they over did some kind of spice that I was not able to narrow down. Whatever spice it was -- DIDN'T BELONG IN MEXICAN RICE. Mexican rice is simple. You can't mess it up and when it does get messed up it's usually because you're trying to get fancy with it......remember folks, keep it simple.We finished with dessert and again, it was a miss. Flan is NOT supposed to jiggle like Jello!!!! Good flan is dense and rich, just like a custard. We ate the Jello, er flan, and said \"check please.\"All in all, the food was \"just okay\" and came no where near in fulfilling the expectation I had for it. If in Chicago again, I would probably go back and give it a second chance, only because it's Rick Bayless and maybe his chefs were having a bad day......Bring your credit card folks, our meal set us back $95 (with tax and tip).

There are very few restaurants out there that actually meet the high expectations that are garnered. This is one of them. I have been a huge fan of Top Chef since the first season and this year's Top Chef Masters spin-off really had me captivated. So it was required that I had to plan a trip to Frontera Grill, the workplace of Top Chef Master champion, Rick Bayless. I had high hopes for trying some amazing Mexican cuisine from the master of Mexican food. This place was packed for lunch. It would have been very difficult to get a table, but luckily I came solo so I was quickly seated at the bar near the kitchen. I knew I had to try a mole dish, but I had a hard time deciding on what to get as an appetizer. It's a lot of food for one person, but hey, I'm not in Chicago very often. The waitress suggested the gorditas and I was set. The Gorditas de Borrego came with three generous sized corn masa cakes stuffed with slow-cooked lamb \"chicarron prensado,\" (which is I guess the Mexican version of bacon) and topped off with avocado and salsa. The corn masa cakes were crispy, but also light and airy. A great start to the meal and each bite had me wanting more. I knew I had to pace myself if I wanted to eat later on, but they were too delicious and fresh to save and pack up. I ended up eating all three.My entree was the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. The star of the dish was of course the delicious and complex mole sauce drenching the chicken enchiladas. The taste was indescribable, but I will try. Each bite left you with an initial burst of flavor, sweet, bitter, savory, and then it slowly faded to a pleasant spiciness. The mole had so many flavors and layers, but they all came together to make the dish work. The chicken was tender and the tortillas were also good, but they took a backseat to the mole. I've never tasted anything so deliciously complex before. I live in San Diego so I am surrounded by Mexican cuisine. If this was Mexican food, I am not sure what I've been eating for the past seven years. Unfortunately, I didn't see the Master Chef while I was eating, but I later saw him when I walked over to Xoco to check it out. I couldn't miss an opportunity to meet him so when he went back to Frontera, I asked the hostess if I could meet him for a picture. I could see he was very busy trying to manage both restaurants, but he was still nice enough to meet me in the kitchen for a quick photo op.

He was friendly, didn't rush us, made great recommendations, and had the answers to several of my questions (I like to cook and try to pick things up wherever I can).

I don't know if all the extra traffic has necessarily been a good thing. I had been trying to make reservations here for almost 2 months. They were actually booked out on a Saturday night through the rest of the year. Eventually, a friend of mine decided to start lining up at the door at 4:30. They reserve tables for walk-ins but the best chance of getting \u00a0is to line up about a hour before they begin seating. We were able to get a table for 8:00. They called us when the table was available. So basically, you wait in line for an hour to get on the list and then stick around the area for a few hours waiting for them to call. We ended up with a table outside (we were a party of 7, so I'm sure that made it a bit more difficult). It was kind of a chilly and misty night. It wasn't ideal, but we made the best of it.I had the mojito with rum. It was really good. Not too sweet and very limey. The drinks run about $10 a pop.We had the guacamole and salsa. They were pretty standard. The salsas were not spicy at all so we decided to try the $2 all you can eat habanero salsa. OMG, that is some intense flames in your mouth! We all took big bites and then starting tearing up and begging for sour cream. No wonder it's $2 all you can eat. No one can eat more that a small dish of that stuff. You'd have to be rushed to the ER. Our server was great, though, he saw us all choking and brought us some sour cream faster that you can say enchilada. The oysters were ok. Not the best. They come with two sauces, a Mexican mignonette and a mole type sauce. The mole was just weird on oysters. No thanks. I had the duck tacos, my husband had the pork tacos and my friends had the lamb dish and the mole enchiladas. The tacos were just ok really. The meat had great flavor and the duck was cooked perfectly, but the sides that come with it were just ok. But they are pretty affordable. The tacos are only $16.50. Unfortunately, for us, the colder temps outside made our meals cool fast. Bummer. My friend who had the enchiladas had one bite and completely wrote off mole. The chicken tasted reheated and was lacking flavor. He ended up giving his left overs to our cab driver. My other friend thought his lamb was poorly seasoned.Okay, so to make a long story short, I was a little underwhelmed. The service was good, but not as attentive as it should be at a place like this, the food was just ok, not at all memorable.

Alright we finally get a table....and WHAT! \u00a0What, a self respecting Mexican restaurant doesn't give you at least one free basket of chips, SACRILEGE! HERESY! \u00a0Though they did give some really yummy seasoned nuts, I had to order the chips, there is no way you can judge a Mexican place without tasting their chips, and they were pretty good, a little thick for my taste, but freshly fried in their kitchen, definitely not from a bag. \u00a0Good salsas too. \u00a0One smokey chili one and a tangy tomatillo one. \u00a0For our second starter we had the fish enchiladas and the tamales with butternut and cheese. \u00a0Both were very good. \u00a0Enchiladas, had a nice green tomatillo sauce. \u00a0The masa on the tamale was nice and moist, but not too moist, but like many tamales there was too much of it. \u00a0Both ends of the tamale were all masa no filling. \u00a0The filling was quite good when you finally got to it and it all was tied together quite well with the mole.And for our main course we shared the duck. \u00a0The duck was cooked very well, still nice and tender, not a dried mess. \u00a0The fresh tortillas accompanying it were excellent, and made great little duck tacos, though I thought the pickled onions included were too strong to go with the duck. \u00a0The rustic mashed potatoes were excellent too, very garlicly and buttery.Too full for dessert, we had try hot chocolate (or \"chockies\" an they are known in some circles). \u00a0Best hot chocolate ever.

We had reservations and were promptly seated. However, the good service ended there. It took a good ten minutes before we even saw a server. The restaurant was noisy, kids were screaming, strollers were parked everywhere. Here's the breakdown of my meal. To say it was mediocre would be a gross understatement. Drink - Top Shelf Margarita - very sweet and weak, I think Chile's makes a better drink. Appetizer - Sampler Platter - As most people mentioned, the ceviche was very good. I wish I had just the ceviche for my meal. The \"mini quesadillas\" were balls of mozzarella deep fried. The taquitos were a nonevent, beef in a deep fried shell. And then we got about 2 tablespoons of guacamole. Dinner - Flank Steak Tacos - This was probably the worst thing I've eaten in a restaurant. It appeared that the meat was cut against the grain, making the meat so chewy it was inedible. I tried to politely nibble, but should have made a stand and sent it back. I left the restaurant still hungry. The other entrees at our table were the tamale and chicken enchiladas. The tamale was pure mush and the enchiladas were dry and uneventful. The mole was pretty good though. So, in all it was just a really disappointing meal. We went in with such anticipation and left with nothing endearing about our meal. We really wanted to like it. As a side note, the day before I went to a Mexican restaurant in a small Wisconsin town, run by an adorable immigrant family, and was blown away by the delicious margaritas, guac, and enchiladas. I would give them 5 stars. I say, save your money and go to a quiet authentic restaurant were the service is good and the food is worth it.

Could not wait to visit Rick's place. Are you kidding me? Top Chef Masters winner? Walked about 40 blocks while visiting Chicago to get to his place from the Metra station. Was told 45-60 min wait, it actually took about 30 to sit 3 on the patio. The first thing we noticed is that there are a number of areas in the restaurant that are in disrepair. My wife said the restroom had a broken door, and had phone numbers written on the walls. The curtains were stained, and there was high dust throughout the establishment. The place sounded like a cafeteria, I know it was packed, but I dont think the experience was enhanced by me thinking a lunch room lady complete with hair net was plating up my food in the back. Try some sound dampening material on the walls Rick, take some of the money from the Hooters style merchandise counter at the front of the store. It was complete with T-shirts.........tacky Its about attention to detail. We ordered the Trio Trio Trio for an app.. Honestly, the shrimp cheviche was the only one that actually made us take notice. The tuna was flat, and the sunfish was VERY fishy. Two drinks: Mojito- WAY limey, had a nice muddle though. Margarita: other that the fact that it was 10 bucks, they didnt leave the shaker, and I got a small martini glass that consisted of maybe 3 swallows, it was pretty good. Should have stayed away from the salt though, it overpowered the drink. Entrees: I had the Quesadillas Norteas with duck and pickled onions. The only way I knew I was eating Mexican cuisine is because there were re-fried black beans on my plate. I found the duck to be good but it had no zing. I suggest they use a different cheese in the quesadillas (they looked like soft tacos to me), the sharpness of the cheese was a hindrance to the dish. The beans were, by far, the best thing on my plate. My wife had the Milanesa de Puerco: sold as a \"crusted pork loin\" what we got was a fried pork chop that was so thin it dried out to almost jerky on the edges from being fried. We expected to see a nice pork medallion that was crusted before roasting, served with a nice roasted tomato sauce/mole. What we got was a fried pork chop with alittle canned stewed tomatoes under it. Hugely under flavored. Again, the best thing on that plate was the black beans. My son got the Tamal special of the day. The masa was VERY soggy because the plate was way over sauced. There was no flavor to the dish except the sauce. No depth in the overall flavor of the entree. When we go to a place that is owned by a guy that is advertised the way that Rick is, we expect to be wowed. I wanna finish my plate and know that I cant do what that guy just did. Sadly, we didnt feel that way when leaving Frontera, what we did feel was raped. It was 104 with the tip for lunch for 3. Either Rick needs to spend more time in his restaurant, or he needs an executive chef that will follow his profiles and stay in the box Rick created. As I stated before, its about attention to detail, and Frontera lacks it. Once my wallet recovers, the experience will not be remembered.

The side of guacamole almost seemed misplaced and there was nothing to eat it with, but if you're a guac fan I guess you'd eat it plain.Sides: Platanos con Crema - Cheese with plantains sounds weird to those who haven't tried but it's actually amazing!Dessert: Chocolate pecan pie - topped with khalua whipped creme, it was fantastic!

Maybe it's being used to CA, but guacamole shouldn't be $9.50. I mean, it was good, but not exceptional or anything. But other than the price, I only had minor quibbles with the food and really enjoyed our lunch (and that there was no wait compared to the 45 min wait at xoco).I found a lot of the food to be sweeter than I wanted. Some of this was probably the particular dishes that we chose, but it did seem to be a theme. For example, the coctel de atun tropical - tuna, avocado/tomatillo guacamole, \"tangy\" mango grapefruit salsa. Sounds like it could be tart and tasty, right? Well it was quite good, but... sweet. I loved the \u00a0tamal de chile poblano, which made me only want to order things that use their wonderful masa in the future, although the squash blossom crema went a bit overboard. I couldn't resist the duck carnitas so I got enchiladas de pato. Again, far too sweet for me, but that one was pretty clearly sweet from the menu; otherwise I liked it (the chile toreados were a nice touch). I was surprised that I didn't like the mexican rice - it's very paprika/pimenton-y and not as tomato-y as I like, so I guess it's just a different style.My favorite dish was the tinga poblano cazuela. We were warned that it was an appetizer, but it came with a lot of tortillas and seemed to be an excellent lunch size to me! I also liked the spiciness in the items that were spicy.

Certainly, this is how I felt about XOCO, the only other Rick Bayless restaurant I've eaten at. Despite the absurd 2 hour wait, I found Frontera to be generally worth it. We started with grilled chive guacamole ($9.75), which is far too smooth; it's almost as if it was made in a food processor. I was hugely not a fan of this. Ceviche and oyster sampler ($44 for a full, $23.50 for a half) redeems admirably; in particular, the tropical tuna cocktail, with fresh ahi, tomatillo, avocado, and fresh mango is light and refreshing yet very flavorful. Enchiladas potosinas ($8), miniature fried masa turnovers with a melange of creamy accompaniments, are very decadent but served in small enough bites that the richness doesn't overwhelm the diner. Duck carnitas enchiladas ($13.50) topped with an assertive red chile de arbol sauce, are very solid. Entrees are very shareable; mole trio ($23.50), with vegetables in yellow mole, mole poblano enchiladas, and lamb in mole oaxace\u00f1o, offer a nice variety; while the veggies are somewhat forgettable, the lamb is rich and tender, and the mole poblano has an appropriately complex and addictive flavor. Chef's special on our visit was a braised brisket, also topped with mole oaxace\u00f1o and served with rich cheesy potatoes, is a very comforting, unique take on a classic pot roast. As a Jew, I'm very finicky about brisket, and this meets my standards. Up to this point in the meal, the food was very good, but nothing was superlative... that all changed with the dark chocolate pecan pie ($7.50); sinfully dark chocolate mixed with chopped pecans, served on a flaky crust, is a very simple yet excellent dessert. Easily the highlight of the meal. Pricing is somewhat high, and service is good. I will say that, considering the fact that they deal with massive crowds nightly, they do a fairly poor job of managing customers who wait for a long time. We showed up at 5:30, were quoted at 2-2.5 hours, and told to call in 45 minutes because it would likely end up being a shorter wait. When we did call, the hostess simply read off her list that we came in at 5:30 and were quoted at 2-2.5 hours, which... I already knew. I called back again 30 minutes later, expecting to hear a similarly useless response, after which I would cancel, but was told by a different hostess that our table was ready \"right now\"... we settled up at the nearby bar where we were drinking, walked over, and found it had been given away. I guess they don't care if they lose clientele, as for every party that says adios, there are five more who would gladly take their place. Still, it's pretty annoying, and were my last memory of Frontera not that delicious pie, this would almost certainly bump them into three-star land for me. All in all, I will begrudgingly admit that it's easy to see why Frontera's food has generated serious hype; while nothing reinvents the wheel, everything is very solidly executed. As a lifelong Chicagoan who may be leaving, I'm glad that I can now say I roughed out the huddled masses to have eaten here. Would I put up with the clusterfuck of dining here again?

As expected, the lady behind the counter took our name down and said it would be two and a half hours before we'd be seated. Just come back in two hours, she said. So, we decided to walk around for a while and come back and get drinks at the bar. After 45 minutes, we checked back in, received a buzzer and went to the bar (which was still full). To our surprise, the buzzer went off after only 15 minutes. So, the actual wait was only around one hour. Good thing, since we were told to come back in two hours??Anyway, onto the food. The margaritas were excellent (the blue agave was superb, the topolo was ok). The side dishes (we had the sopes and the ceviche) were fantastic. The main course was also wonderful (I had the asada brava - flank steak with a sweet corn tamale). Given all the expectations, it was difficult to see how the restaurant could have lived up to the hype, but it certainly did. the one thing I would say is that the portions (both food and drink) could have been just a tad bigger for the price.

I am typically not a fan of chicken mole, as I find it too spicy, bitter, and unpleasant to look at, but Frontera's chicken mole enchiladas have changed my mind completely. The flavor is complex, subtle, and yet absolutely wonderful that you just want to keep eating it. On the first bite I was a little \"huh?\" and then by the 2nd or 3rd bite I found a strange craving for more coming over me. I liked sampling all my family members dishes as well but I held a special place for the mole. The Trio, Trio, Trio is also excellent and a great start to the whole meal. It was another hot summer day and dipping into that guacamole was heavenly. I'm not usually a cilantro fan either(I know, why eat Mexican then?) but maybe they use really good cilantro or know how to do just the right proportions, but anything with cilantro was just fine. I loved every bite and we had to get more chips too because they were just perfect with it. We even drank the left over juices in the cups.Until dessert...Flan!!! FLAN!!! Blackberries and flan btw is genius, and having two flavors was nice. We also had the ice cream(rasberry and fig) with a side of chocolate dipping action going on. Ohh, rasberry and choco heaven~ The fig was good too but I have a special place in my tummy for rasberry so that disappeared faster... Excellent service and we were seated fairly quickly though you may want to send someone ahead and while looking for parking you'll arrive just in time to sit down.

WRONG. The restaurant was already completely packed, and it was 1 \u00a01/2 - 2 hour wait for a table! Madness.Since there wasn't even room at the bar at Frontera, we decided to get a \"snack\" at Bayless' new Mexican street food restaurant next door, XOCO, while we waited. \u00a0(see my review on XOCO).An hour and a half later, our buzzer finally went off for our table at Frontera Grill. It was a lovely evening, so I was pleased to get a table on the patio. We started off with their special Mezcal margarita (YUM!) and ordered an array of items...Tostaditas (tortilla chips with 2 kinds of salsa) - the chips were good, but there was nothing special about the salsas. They tasted surprisingly similar and kind of watered down. If a restaurant is going to charge for chips and salsa, it should taste better than this.Scallop Ceviche \u00a0- this ceviche really highlighted the plumpness and sweetness of the scallops. The melon toned down the acidity of the ceviche, making it more soft and elegant, but there was still enough heat to give it a kick.Tamal de Elote (sweet corn tamales) - the fresh corn flavor was so sweet and vibrant in the tamales. The soft cheese added a slight savoriness, but this dish could have easily been a nice dessert. Enchiladas de Mole Poblano (chicken enchiladas with mole) - \u00a0I've been dying to try this mole ever since I saw Bayless make it on Top Chef Masters. And I'm happy to report that the mole was outstanding...slightly sweet with lots of heat, tang, earthiness, and depth. Unfortunately it couldn't make up for the dry, overcooked chicken, which was exacerbated by the dense, chewy tortillas. I did enjoy the side of black beans though - tasted like refried black beans, only much more savory and delectable. \u00a0I had REALLY high expectations for Frontera Grill (perhaps maybe too high). Although the food was good, it wasn't at the level I had expected...and definitely not worth waiting over an hour for. Way too much hype.

Unfortunately, I thought I could do so easily after 8 PM on a Tuesday night. Not so.My partner in dining crime and I were told the wait for 2 would be upwards of 45 minutes, so we circled the bar like hawks until we could get a seat to eat there--which was about a 15 minute wait instead. The atmosphere at the bar is great, so we definitely did not feel short-changed.This being my first trip to Frontera, I wanted to order small plates so I could get a sampling of the style. I started with the scallop ceviche, which was nearly perfect. The shaved jicama rounds were a nice textural contrast to the silky scallops. And though pineapple is one of my least-favorite flavors, the sweetness of the juice was a nice contrast to the acid and spice from the lightly toasted Serrano chiles. I just would have preferred the juice of a different sweet fruit, like peach (but that's a personal palate preference, not a knock on the dish).I knocked off a star on my rating because of the wait in between my scallops and second dish, the chicken mole enchiladas. The pace of the meal and quality of service started fine, but we had to wait 30 minutes between our starters and second course, which is just outrageous.Ultimately, the wait proved to be worth it for the three little chicken enchiladas with incredibly complex mole.

We walked over the day before we wanted to dine there and spoke to some workers who were setting up tables and asked for a reservation for the following day. They said they couldn't take a reservation at that time, but to call tomorrow and make one by phone. Ok, next day we do just that and are told they don't take reservations by phone, but to just show up and get in line at 4:15ish for the 5:00 opening and we would get a table (we had 7:30 show tickets and told them this on the phone.) Ok, no problem -- we show up at 4:15 and are about the 3rd people in line. We wait until 5:00 when an extremely annoyed employee with a rotten attitude slowly opens the doors and herds in the now very large crowd. We make our way to the front desk and see that beepers are being given out and that there were no tables available (one peek in the dining room showed an empty room!) When we told the attitude queen our plight, he rolled his obviously dyed eyelashes and basically said that was too damn bad for us. I mean, c'mon -- this is Frontera Grill -- we should be honored to stand in line -- let alone actually get a table and pay money to eat dinner there. Snotty, rude and ridiculous!

I arrived with my girlfriend for a late dinner around 10pm. I was told that there would be a 30 minute wait, but 10 minutes later, I was informed that a table had opened up.The decor is nice and warm. The crowd density is what you'd expect from a restaurant by a famed chef who has been on television. It was very crowded, even at this late hour, and quite noisy. If you're looking to grab a bite and have some peace and quiet, you might want to hold out and get a table at Topolobampo, which is right through a curtained door, but has a more intimate dining experience. However, if you're like me and just wanted some good food, stay put.I ordered two small plates, Taquitos de Pollo and another dish that I forget the name of. My girlfriend had the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and Tamal de Mole Amarillo. My two dishes arrived within a few minutes, but it was easily a half-hour before the other two items arrived. That changed our eating plans--we were originally just going to eat what we ordered, but ended up splitting the whole meal down the middle, since we were getting hungry waiting.The food, however, did not disappoint! Great, fresh tasting food came to the table, and was always presented with a smile, which must be difficult in a room full of tables set 2-3 feet apart.I would have given just about any other restaurant 3 stars for the wait, but understanding that this place is much talked about and therefore prone to crowding and delay, I'm giving Frontera the benefit of the doubt.All the dishes were flavorful, and needed no further seasoning. The mole on the enchiladas was a bit strong, but the black beans that accompanied it really helped offset the flavor.A bit of people watching (meal watching, rather) showed me how tasty everything looked: the presentation was executed just as well as the actual quality of the food.

One thing to note, there seems to be a lot of overlap between this and Topolobampo. It's probably easier to get in to and a little less expensive, so you might go here first, then try the upscale if you're really hooked. I met my Dad here for dinner one night. We came on a wintry Wednesday, and arriving at 6:15ish, were able to just get a table right away - I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this is very unusual. We started with the ceviche trio - ahi tuna, shrimp/ocotpus, and sunfish. The sunfish was the clear winner, the right balance of tangy and sweet, and a great chewy fish texture with crispy jicama made for a nice combo. My dinner was the chile rellenos - again, being able to just get these is probably unusual. I've heard over and over again how good these are, so I would have been silly to pass it up. They turned out excellent, superb green chile flavor, battered with a fluffy, almost pancake or souffle style batter (I expected a little more of a crispy, fried-chickeny batter), one filled with white cheese, and one filled with pork picadillo. The whole thing was in a nice pool of garlic tomato broth, and perhaps the perfect complement, a very simple alfalfa (or bean) sprout salad in a vinegar dressing. So a great combination of flavors, tender, juicy pork, and outstanding chiles. Worth it. My Dad had the braised pork shoulder, which was also very good. Tender, juicy pork, pickled and sauteed onions, good black beans, and white corn tortillas (no flour - excellent). This was pretty similar to the picadillo in the rellenos, but without as much sweetness. The kicker was a small quantity of thin habanero salsa. Our waiter warned us repeatedly about how hot this was. My dad and I both eat pretty hot food, but this really wasn't all that hot - it was, however, excellent. The right complement to the pork and beans. I had a desert that was pretty unusual - chocolate ice in a lime/mint broth with tangerine and grapefruit segments, and pomegranate seeds. It turned out to be an amazing combo - think of the pomegranate as little chocolate chips, and the refreshing milk-free chocolate ice paired nicely with the tart broth and fruits. Very good. Dad had a pecan pie tart type thing with some ice cream - good pecan pie with chewy edges. Yay for chewy edges. As for menu overlap - the ceviche trio is also on the menu at Topo (and I had it there too, where it was also quite good) and I also saw the duck breast mole that I enjoyed greatly at Topo making an appearance at Frontera. Perhaps the older items from Topo make their way down to Frontera and a wider audience - if that's the policy, then terrific, because the prices are more reasonable here than at Topo. Al that said, I would totally go back. This turned out to be a tad more expensive than I had intended, but we both had deserts, which were a tad pricey. Either way, I was not let down by the hype over the restaurant in general or the chile rellenos in specific, and would very much recommend Frontera.

Ok, so I may not be a Mexican expert, but I grew up in California, and have had my fair share of Mexican food.

Time went on and some other woman arrived (a manager I guess) who explained that the waitress had forgotten to put the order in, but that she's not normally that forgetful. My meal arrived shortly thereafter, but the waitress never actually apologized and there was no compensation for the mistake either. Mistakes happen, but honestly, for a restaurant of this caliber, they really should have handled this mishap better. To top it off, my main course of chicken breast with green mole of poblanos, pumpkin seeds, squash blossoms, chayote & cream was kind of subpar. The mole was not that great and the herb-infused green corn torta that came with the meal had a very bizarre flavor. The chicken was good, however. The size of the meal was also pretty small. Some of the other entrees at our table were much larger.I skipped dessert but other people at our table had the strawberry shortcake and the chocolate pecan pie. I had a bite of the pie and it was delicious.Another negative was the bathroom. The women's room has two stalls and one sink, which is ridiculously tiny given the size of this place and the number of people hanging out at the bar. It was not particularly late in the evening when I went in there, but the bathroom was pretty trashed. There were paper towels strewn all over the place and there were none left to use. Again, for a restaurant of this caliber, they should be a bit more on top of things like this.In short, the food is ok, but this place does not live up to the hype and I would not wait two hours to eat here again.", "Date": "2012-05-26", "Author_Location": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"Author": "Ronny D.", "ReviewID": "4d-z42eS6Pe5SnxSnD0RIg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Made the reservation a few months back for Saturday night at 8:30pm.

Be sure to ask the very knowledgable waitstaff about details if you are a veg-eater-for example, beans that may appear veg are actually cooked in lard - just be careful.

The service was great. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and accommodating. She even checked with the chef regarding my husband's food allergies (almonds - random, I know) and thank God she did, because apparently the mole is chock-full of them.

The presentation was vibrant and beautiful and the flavors were delicious. A great start to our meal. We also ordered the chips and salsa. Rick Bayless' tomatillo salsa is amazing! It's so bright and has so much flavor, I wanted to pour it over everything.For entrees, I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano and my hubby ordered the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena.

Not this carne asada. It was thick, succulent and marinated to perfection.The Topolo Margaritas were great - really fresh, not to sweet, super strong.

Adding mine would be a redundancy on par with pointing out that Newt Gingrich is pond scum. Of course we had to stop by Frontera on our visit to Chicago. It was a cold windy night, and we ordered a large, homey meal to compensate: lamb cazuela (Borrego Al Cascabel, duck pumpkin mole (Pato en Mole de Calabaza), flank steak (Falda Asada \"Brava\"), and vanilla ice cream for dessert.We didn't count on the hefty portion size of the cazuela. A single-size cast iron skillet mounding over with sexy lamb bits + fluffy homemade corn tortillas = a) a filling meal all on its own and b) too tantalizing NOT to finish. Fully aware of the consequences ahead (pending entrees), we exchanged steely, determined eyes across the table, fortified our resolve, girded our stomach and forged bravely onward--slopping through the sauce to the very bottom of that pit of deliciousness. One whiff of the entrees, and I knew I was in trouble. The sumptuous wafts simultaneously set me off salivating at an uncomfortable rate, while reminding me that the little room left in my stomach had just been filled by aromas. Uf! Barely making headway into the duck and steak (both delicious, get them!), I had a gut-wrenching (literally) decision to make. If I had one more bite, I could banish all aspirations for dessert, and I just had to know what goat milk caramel was. We microwaved (don't judge!) the leftover duck, steak, and tortillas the next day, as an afternoon snack. It was like back-to-back Christmas, I tell you! All the flavors (sweet duck, meaty steak, spicy salty marinades) had saturated and melded together; they were the best tacos of 2011. And the texture was still perfect. What a pal, that microwave.

No. It comes with the territory. So get over it. Drinks were good. I was a little envious of my friend as she ordered the fancy shmancy Topolo marg that comes in a dainty margarita glass. I went with the standard gold marg and that was unceremoniously poured from a pre-made mix behind the bar. That was disappointing. I should've just brought my own Jose Cuervo mix from Jewel and saved myself a few extra bucks. Guac was good. No real heat, but it was scarfed down in between bits of conversation. The queso was thick and gooey, served with warm corn tortillas for dipping. We both admitted that we are not corn tortilla fans, but these were little soft pillows of perfection for cheesy goodness to rest on.

Sit at the bar and avoid the lines...Firstly, let me start by saying that I may have found my favorite beer thanks to this restaurant. Frontera has a special Goose Island brew all to itself--the Marisol. I love Goose Island beer, and the flavor of this Belgian ale was the best of any of them. Give it a try because it may be hard to find anywhere else and it's actually a somewhat cheap $6.50.The food: I honestly didn't try as many dishes as I would have wanted, but I will update this review as that changes as I will definitely return.Frontera guacamole: Other reviews rave on and on about this guac. I've honestly had a lot better at several Mexican restaurants...probably would skip this next time, especially given the small portion size as well.Street food trio: I love meat, but the vegetarian avocado dish may have been the most flavorful one of the trio. Of course, the skirt steak and shredded beef were also fantastic. TINY portions.Mole trio: Great value for the $. The pork in clemole was downright amazing. Mole poblano enchiladas were also very good, and the vegetarian green peanut mole was a truly unique flavor that I enjoyed more with each bite.Surprisingly, this was enough to stuff my girlfriend and me so we didn't even venture to the dessert menu.

Good, but an acquired taste, and more gamy than other goat dishes. Next up, the salmon tartar with a peanut/plantain chip sauce. This dish had a distinctly odd, bordering on unpleasant flavor. The peanut sauced masked the salmon taste and I couldn't find the texture of the plantain chips. We also ordered the sopes rancheros, with short ribs. Delicious though not transcendent. The sopes were well crisped and the short ribs full of flavor. Probably the best dish of the night. Finally, we ordered the maple pork tacos. I swore I was eating chicken! We even asked the waiter, who laughed and insisted we were eating pork. He also said that people ask him this all the time. I'd say if people think your pork is chicken, you have a problem! I like my pork to taste like pork, thank you. Also, no hint at all of maple flavor. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. All in all, the meal was reasonably good with a few great moments. But overall, given the prices, the wait time, and the incredible hype, I'd say it doesn't live up.Best thing I ate in Chicago all weekend?

We figured we would get there 10 minutes before dinner service (4:50 PM) started so we would get the best chance. To our delight, we got to the restaurant and there was only one party in front of us, and the host kindly asked us for our name and we were the second in line. We were ushered into the waiting area, and at 5:00 they let us into the bar area. At about 5:15 (and the restaurant was practically full at this point) we were then seated promptly, and the experience began: Drinks: -Mexican Mojito (w/ tequilla) x2-Topolo Margarita x2-----Drinks, both were well excuted, I liked the Mojito allittle bit better.Platillos Pequenos: -Sopes Rancheros (Masa boats filled with shredded beef, avocado, and house made cheese)-Queso Fundito Classico (melted cheese, w/ house made chorizo, onion and mexican oregano served w/ house made corn tortillas)----Appetizers: thanks to yelp, there were multiple reccomendations for the Sopes Rancheros, and boy did it live up to the hype. I could tell this dish was refined, refined again, and again. The result is the most flavorful mouthful I have ever had. Thankfully for me and you, this item does not rotate on and off the menu. Sorry queso fundito, \u00a0but you were no where close to being as good as the sopes. ( i would order something else to replace the queso fundito if i were to to it again. Especialidades:-Pollo en Mole Verde (chicken with green mole sauce, mexican mashed potatoes, & spinach)-Pato en Mole Xico (duck breast with dark mole sauce, smoky green beans, & \u00a0mexican rice)---------Main Course: all parts of the chicken dish were amazing, the chicken, sauce, potatoes and spinach were all instruments to a symphony in your mouth. The duck dish was good, but not as balanced as the chicken dish, duck was well cooked, sauce was the best part of either dishes (soo smoky and complex), rice was well seasoned, green beans did not really add to the dish but were edible. Desserts: -Tamal de Chocolate (chocolate tamale, home made cinnamon ice cream, mexican chocolate glaze)- Mexican Hot Chocolate--------The Tamale de Chocolate was a bit dissapointing to end the meal off, just a mealy chocolate tamale. texturally, it did not come together. The house made cinnamon ice cream was so-so. The mexican hot chocolate saved it though, you could taste the spice that played off the deep flavor of chocolate, it was wonderful. The whole meal came to allittle less than $130.00, which was really reasonable for the amount, and quality of food and drinks (4 drinks total). The service was nothing short of spectacular, the waiter gave us drink recommendations and shared with us his favorites off of the menu. I dont know what all of the 1 & 2 star reviews on yelp here are for, I cant concieve of giving this place lower than a 4 star review. Rick Bayless, you are an impostor, you are not mexican.

Seated and very cramped, we found a dish the size of a tablespoon filled with herbed nuts. Literally not even enough for one handful. This was supposed to be shared by the entire group (we were three). I kept thinking to myself, doesn't EVERY mexican place offer at the very least a basket of chips and salsa? NOPE. Nope and NOPE.Our order was taken by someone that seemed more disinterested by his duties than we were with the paltry dish of nuts. It only gets worse. Our experience is somewhat improved by a few drinks. Cold Negro Modelo and Pacifico are a pleasure whatever the circumstances. This, however, was fleeting. Our food arrived.Since when do you call Fajitas, Tacos? Two of us ordered the steak tacos. When it arrived, here is what was presented: One bowl of bean soup, a small cask of tortillas and the woeful, fatty, mini pile of finely sliced steak (or was that horse meat, not sure) and peppers (peppers?). That's it.How did tacos become bean soup, meat shreds and peppers? Is this authentic Mexican? Is Rick Bayless insane? Is he kidding me?!!Worst sit-down dinner I have had in Chicago in a long time. I couldn't even eat the tacos because I kept having to spit out the fatty meat shreds. Sorry to gross you out here. It's making me nauseous just thinking about it again. Wow, what a let down.These are the facts. You can make your own judgements. I made mine: never go back to Frontera Grill.

What great flavor they had! \u00a0The rice was good, and the flank steak was mouth wateringly fabulous! \u00a0It came with a corn tamale which was also really great and not overly sweet like some restaurants make it. \u00a0Other orders on my table: pork loin- which was SO good!, the chicken tacos, which seemed ok; however, the guacamole it came with was phenomenal! \u00a0For dessert, Raspberry sorbet, which really tasted like a fruitroll up, haha! \u00a0But still tasted good and twas definitely a palate pleaser, \u00a0Service was great- they brought us extra hot salsa without us even asking. \u00a0They were courteous and extremely patient with us while we decided to order :) \u00a0On a side note- another customer in the bathroom was really rude, and a lady who was restocking stuff in the bathroom was gracious enough to apologize on her behalf. \u00a0That is called courtesy! \u00a0We ate our food so happily!

That's all I really have to say about this place. I came in expecting a much better meal, considering the famous chef (Rick Bayless?) owns this place. Never really been a huge fan of Mexican food, but decided to give this a shot since it's technically \"Nueva Latino\" and my friend loves brunch here. I ordered the recommended special of Mahi Mahi, which wasn't bad but the tomatina sauce was too strong and overpowered the fish... there wasn't a right balance. Plus, it felt more like a heavy dinner than light brunch. Our waiter was gracious about giving us more of the spiced nuts (which, sadly, were much tastier than my entree). I tried the Sapitas too, but they failed to impress. And I would have appreciated if the waiter told us that the special was double the price of their other dishes... which I found out the hard way.So, ehhh. Would I come here again? Unlikely.

Since this place doesn't take reservations, I knew it would be key to visit the restaurant on a weekday right when they open. We got there about 11:45 and were able to find seats in the bar. Seating setup is unfriendly for odd-numbered groups (seats were in twos and fours), but the staff let us push two tables together - saving the three of us from huddling around a table meant for two. What dismayed us was the LONG wait we had to endure for our food! I think they were understaffed, because the lunch crowd seemed manageable, yet we had to wait for 45 minutes before we got our appetizers. I split the Entrems Surtido appetizer platter and pork tacos with my friend. I HIGHLY recommend the appetizer platter. It lets you try mini portions of their quesadillas, chicken taquitos, ceviche tostadas and jcama salad. Because I was thinking of ordering each of these items for my entree, the appetizer platter let me try all the dishes and still try something else! My favorite was the jicama salad - it had mangoes and the tangy dressing provided a nice complement to the sweet mangoes and crunchy jicama. Even though we had to wait again for our entrees, it was definitely worth it! The pork was marinated to perfection. Featuring notes of red chile, pineapple, bacon and onion, it was a fiesta in my mouth. Each ingredient balanced the others. Seriously, it was friggin' awesome. I'm not a big meat eater, but I will gladly eat a whole bowl of this stuff everyday if I could. We were also served six tortillas so it's perfect to split.I will be back to Frontera Grill.

Compared to other restaurants of celebrity chefs, it lacked that \"wow\" factor.We dove right in to start with a Beef-and-Poblano Tamal (rather than paying $10 for guacamole, I don't care how good it is). The beef was cooked splendidly but the flavour was a little acidic and I was hoping for more heat. We followed that with Yucatecan Ceviche, which I would say was a highlight. Again, a lot of acidity but this time it worked perfectly. For entrees, we split Duck with Pasilla-Huitlacoche Sauce and Pork in Manchamanteles. While the mole had a rich flavour, the sauce on the duck was salty and overpowering and again, the acidity did not work well with my palate.The seating was very cozy (loud) and that can either be fun or annoying.

I had no expectations of this place or Bayless coming in, so my experience is fairly unbiased and raw. You'll see a lot of Bayless fans here who've waited to try his place, and perhaps that factors in to a good rating, but please do read some of the bad reviews and decide on your own, with a tempered view of what this place is hyped up to be.We got there at 9, and put our names down. I saw a couple waiting outside like us and had assumed they were also waiting for a table. 15 min passed by in the cold and rain, only to find that they were waiting for the valet to bring their car. I thought... \"uh oh, it's not a good sign when the valet service takes 15 minutes.This was a Thursday night, and we finally got seated at 9:45. Ok, so that's annoying but that's acceptable. But i will add that there isn't a particular reason why they can't do their reservations better, and there isn't a good reason for a 45 min wait when it's that late for dinner on a Thur night. We get seated near the entrance, and i notice that there are 4 women around the reception desk; two handling the seating and two just literally standing there. We have no water, and we're missing one table setting, but they didn't seem too concerned. Finally someone comes by and gives us water, and we have to remind him twice to get us an extra table setting.Our waitress takes the drink order, and doesn't bother to tell us about their daily special dishes or anything that's good whatsoever; fine, maybe that's just how it is here. We order some appetizers. She brings out my beer, and puts it in front of the wrong person (i was the only one that ordered a drink, so how hard is it to remember this?). I slowly move the glass and beer toward me (so she'd notice), but she didn't and it didn't seem to matter one bit that she served the wrong person. She later comes around again to take our main order and when two of us indicated to her we wanted the daily special (lamb) she told us they were all out of it. She apologized for this, but it's fairly mindless not to point this out and having the two of us to go through the menu again to order our entree. So at this point we're starving - at least the appetizers came out in acceptable time.I ordered their pork loins and this other friend who wanted the special ordered enchiladas. We haven't eaten since lunch and we were starved, and pretty much anything at this point would have been good to eat, but the dishes were hard to finish. My pork was, as my friends described it \"funky\", dry, and certainly not particularly Mexican. It was bland with some weird sauce, and i was not pleased. My friend only ate half of his dish.At some point, my friend spilled a whole glass of water, which spilled on to the floor near the entrance. This was done right in front of the two Mexican ladies i mentioned earlier. minutes passed... nothing done, and now my feet are in the water a bit as well. I kept looking at them like \"Are you guys gonna ask someone to clean this up?\" and finally after a good 10 minutes, someone wiped it off the floor. I mean, it didn't bother me too much, but what if someone took a spill there? It's just total disregard for safety and just the basic desire to keep the place to some standard. And it's now nearly 11 PM, and things are not that busy.By the end of the night, it had taken us 2 hours to finish out dinner, and we weren't being too social or chatty. I don't think they even thanked us or said goodbye when we left.As with many people, i expect to have great food and service, or at least for one to make up for the shortcomings of the other.

I first visited Frontera Grill July, 2010 for my 30th birthday. Being new to the city, I was not aware of the fact that the restaurant needed at least an 8 week notice for reservation. We put our names in a 5 pm and were seated around 730. In the meantime, we all indulged in a couple of cocktails. I dont know if it was the alcohol or the hunger, but when we finally got our food, it felt as though every bite was a heavenly explosion of spicy goodness. From the ceviche, to the queso fundido, not a single appetizer was a disappointment.At that time, they had a flank steak on their menu. I had it prepared medium rare...OMG amazing. My friend got ribs, which for not being a BBQ place, were amazing! The only mildly disappointing thing ordered were the chicken tacos...oh well. No one can be 100% perfect.Fast forward to April, 2011. \u00a0My friend and I wanted to relive the experience of Frontera Grill. \u00a0Before her visit, she made reservations in February so that when she came we would not have to wait! \u00a0They were prompt in seating us for our Saturday, 9 pm reservation.

Theoretically, we paid for alcholic drinks.Sadly, the meal wasn't any better. \u00a0I ordered a steak dish, medium well. \u00a0It was cooked ok, but the cut of meat was pretty mediocre. \u00a0It was chewy/grainy and kept getting stuck in my teeth. \u00a0As far as flavor is concerned, I almost want to say I had a better experience at Las Tablas.

Many a cultural monolith has been felled by hype.So how could anything possibly live up to the hype of this place?I don't know, but Frontera does it. Food, service, atmosphere, heck even price for what you're getting, Frontera is pretty much as perfect as any earthbound restaurant is ever going to get. Obviously, it's an extremely busy place. Yet they have the system there down to a science, making the whole process of waiting surprisingly efficient. On a similar note, the wait staff is amazing. To say they are on top of things is an understatement. They know all of the insides and outs of the food they are serving and are able to make suggestions in such informative ways that it never feels like a sales pitch. Plus they're quick, efficient, and friendly in that important genuine kind of way.The food. Oh man the food. How can something taste this good? I mean, it's just everything went into a different scale of deliciousness than anything I've eaten before. That's how you live up to hype. By adding entirely new flavor experiences.So add to the brilliant menu, an amazing selection of drinks, including a Goose Island beer brewed only for Frontera, and the culinary delights are impossible to top.Sometimes things don't deserve the accolades they receive. I could name numerous things, but would likely only end up offending far too many people. With that said, Frontera Grill belongs nowhere near that list.

I think this might be a good time to arrive if you don't mind eating later, because according to the other reviews it can be quite a pain in the ass to get seated during peak times. We started off with their Blue Agave Margarita with Cazadores Reposado substituted for the default blanco and the Yucatan ceviche. The drinks arrived after about 3 minutes and were rather delicious. The lime and the tequilla were married expertly with a hint of Cointreau, which left us both impressed...it justified the 11.50 price.The ceviche arrived next in a cocktail glass with lime chips on a small plate. It was very tasty, fresh and just as it should be. The only complaint was that it left me wanting more (being more accustomed to larger 'merican-sized portions, I guess). For the main course we both ordered the Tacos al Carbon. I chose catfish and my fiancee ordered the chicken. It took probably 12 minutes or so to arrive, but was timed pretty well so we didn't have much of a wait after our ceviche was finished. Also, I requested 'actually spicy' habenero salsa which the waiter was happy to oblige. The tacos were delicious, with a near-perfect portion size and very tasty guac on the side. The habenero salsa was spicy, slightly tangy and made me sweat a little bit (like it should). The other salsas weren't nearly as spicy, but I can tell a good salsa when I taste it and these were all 4.5 or better.That was the good. Following are the reasons that I subtracted .75 points from the review:  \u00a01) After ordering our dinner (the tacos) the waiter suggested to me that we order some rice, beans or another side. I didn't prompt for this or ask any questions about the portion size, so it was strange. For an establishment of this caliber I don't expect or appreciate attempts at up-selling. \u00a02) Upon having our tacos served our waiter made a mention that if we needed more tortillas we could just ask...which was fine. However, between two people we only had 5 very small tortillas. Although they were fresh and delicious, why couldn't they just give us enough in the first place?...and at least give 6 for two people! We had to wait probably 3-4 minutes to get the waiters attention and request more. tl;dr Great drinks, great food, prompt service (mostly), but an up-sell attempt and a slight attention-to-detail problem required a .75 point deduction.

Props to Rick Bayless though--I was incredibly impressed and have now decided this is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago. That being said, the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is as follows:1) Not only are advance reservation not allowed, but they over-quote their wait time. I went again last night and the same thing occurred as the first night. I put my name in at 6pm. Was told 1.5-2 hours for a table (when there were literally only 4 other names ahead of me on their waiting list). Ran home and changed out of my work clothes. Was called by the hostess and told \"two last minute cancellations had occurred and I could be seated now\" after a whopping 30 minutes had passed. Amazing how that works.2) Hands-down the single best, most impressive, and delicious dish on the menu are the Chiles Rellenos: Classic, souffle-battered stuffed poblanos (one cheese, one minced-pork picadillo) with roasted tomato-chile sauce; black beans & Mexican rice. --Small problem--the restaurant ONLY serves them on Thursdays and they ONLY make 20 portions of this dish (or a total of 40 stuffed peppers) on the Thursdays they are served. What. The. Heck. So irritating. So, my words of advice are: This Thursday evening--swing by Frontera Grill at 5pm. Expect them to tell you you won't be seated until 7pm but immediately reserve (yes, you have to place a reservation for a table AND this dish) your order of Chiles Rellenos. Grab a marg at the bar. And you'll have your amazing dish within 30 minutes.That all being said, also make SURE you get a fresh ceviche and an order of their chips and guac. *heaven* And if you're not a marg person--their mojitos are insanely good too.The steak tacos specialty plate (Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena) was also out of this world.Didn't much care for the Pescado a la Campechana dish though.

Frontera was a pioneer of this cuisine in America, and I am appreciative of the restaurant's importance. I hate to admit that I thought it was just average. When it comes to Mexican food, I love Rosario's in San Antonio, Condesa in Austin or Red Iguana in Salt Lake City. Their portions are reasonable, the dishes are creative, and the food is amazing. Like Border Grill in Los Angeles, I found Frontera to not excel at any of these. We ordered a rather expensive appetizer trio, but the portions were so small that we consumed the entire platter in less than 3 bites a person. I know ... I know ... I'm supposed to say, \"Aren't those taquitos so small and so cute, and that bite just explodes with flavor.\" Baloney. I don't need lots of food, but I do like to feel that I got enough to justify a $20 expense. With that said, the best deal was the $9.95 chips and guac. The chips were warm and fresh, and the guac (which I don't really like that much) was excellent. The salsas were perhaps my favorite item of the whole night. As others have noted, the fried plantains with cheese topping are the bomb.Again, I'm going to be a cheap skate and complain about the drink sizes. The margaritas were $11, and the quality was excellent. The glass -- well, it was about the size of a shot glass. Ok, maybe 2 shot glasses. But bring me a big margarita -- if Chili's can make me a fake one in a big glass for $5, surely Frontera can make one with tequila and lime juice that is a decent size for $11. I love creative food, and I have a strong appreciation for quality. But I have a real pet peeve about places that think they can serve small portions and charge exorbitant amounts for them on the grounds that it small = extraordinary. It doesn't equal extraordinary. It doesn't make the place more elite. It simply makes it pretentious and a waste of resources.Don't get me wrong. I love the atmosphere. The service was attentive.

I've been wanting to try one of Bayless's REAL restaurants for a while after trying his overachieving airport food from Tortas Frontera at O'Hare. Somehow I managed to snag a lunch reservation three days in advance, but I have a feeling that's not the norm - so book early!We arrived on time and I was surprised to see that the restaurant was completely empty - had just opened at 11:30. They took our coats (which turned out to be really helpful because the seating situation was cozy, but would have become cramped if we and the other patrons had our coats) and we were seated promptly in a half booth. Unfortunately, I was facing the wall so I didn't really get a chance to see the restaurant fill up or to get an idea of the atmosphere. I also never saw my waiter's face - he only ever stood behind us and the two of us facing the wall had to crane our necks to see him. The food was fantastico. The guacamole was some of the best I've had; good but not overwhelming portion of the green chile (just enough for an added kick), and the cilantro gave it that little extra kick that made it so fab. The salsa that was brought to the table was phenomenal. I mean really, really. Loved both the spicy red (three chile?) and the smoky tomatillo. Biggest complaint is that those portions were barely enough for one person, let alone the four of us who were diving our chips into them nonstop. We shared the Yucatecan Ceviche, which was a better portion for four, and had great flavors - again, loved the cilantro and especially with the shrimp, calamari, and orange flavors. I devoured my enchiladas (wish I could remember the name but I'm not seeing it on the online menu) - they were stuffed with mushrooms and had a great side of rice and a tomatillo sauce on the side. It was great but I wish I had gone a little farther out of my comfort zone and tried some of the street food or maybe one of the trios - which all looked excelente as well.This is definitely not your average Mexican restaurant, and I would save it for a time when you know you can savor the food and won't feel rushed to make a decision on what to order.

His collection of restaurants situated all around this corner inspires me to gluttonous efforts every time I'm around. I knew that our supper club could not really move forward without checking Frontera off our list. It's not a simple endeavor. So, I decided to take this one upon myself. Here's the drill: doors open at 5 sharp (5:20 Tuesdays) lines cue up in advance and you can wait it out at the bar until your party arrives. They won't seat you until everyone is there, when you'll get the flashing buzzer. They also take a few reservations well in advance, which I've been able to score for Topolobampo, the more upscale twin next door (highly recommended). And so it was that after a short wait in the afternoon sun and calling out a lingerer that tried in vain to bypass the organization of the line, I was cozied up at the bar awaiting friends over a good book and better margarita. Personally, I like the Topolo and Blue Agave margs. They also have a huge selections of tequila. Our group arrived as the drinks flowed. Just grab one of the guys busily working the room and they will get you all set. Shout out to our man for bringing our next round and bill to the table to settle once we were on. That was a nice touch, not that they miss any here. The six of us settled in for a feast. We got a bunch of appetizers to sample: Guac, salsa and chips. Tomatillo, Chipotle and Habenero salsa. Ceviche trio, of which the Hawaiian tuna was the best of the lot. The jicama salad perfectly cooled the intense heat of the habenero salsa, which I always have to get to test the boundaries of pain. These were all great calls to start and you'll surely want to have at least one of those. Now when it comes to the mains here, you want to be adventurous. You can't go wrong with the rellenos, but if you're not one of the first tables of the night, they will already be gone. Rick's moles are what to get-trust me. Red chile-rubbed Gunthorp duck breast, Oaxacan mole coloradito (ancho chiles, sesame seeds, spices, Oaxacan chocolate), Iroquois white corn torta (sesame, hint of chocolate), grilled green beans. So many different flavors going on with this one, I loved it. The dayboat catch of swordfish at the other end of the table looked great and everyone enjoyed the cuisine. I was not about to leave without dessert and the Cafe de olla, fruity sugary coffee goodness. We got a few desserts and made short work of them, the tres leches cake and the chocolate pecan pie, which reminds me of a derby pie. Love the Kahlua topping on that one. Yummy. I'm almost forgetting about how cool this restaurant is. There are neat paintings and pinata looking dragons all around. The service was flawless and professional. They got to us quickly and though there was a good wait, excellent company passes it easily. You could always just snack on some small bites in the bar area and make a meal of that and the drinks and have a fantastic meal. I never did see the waiter with the wicked cool handlebar mustache that I've seen here for the last decade (where you at bro?). But, that hardly made a difference.

The atmosphere on the casual Frontera side (Topolo is the more upscale of the two) is total hustle and bustle - a bit on the loud side with a hopping a mix of tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of \"The Ricker\" and local city business folk that love a good, flair-filled Mexican meal and know where to find it. D\u00e9cor-wise we're talking Spanish tile floors, mache masks, semi-cramped dining quarters of wood tables and chairs, all surrounded by incredibly colorful works of floral, abstract and totally cuckoo Spanish art. Bring your loudest hammer pants... you'll fit in fine! The service is warm and slow... almost like being in Mexico itself... sit back, enjoy and start with the house guacamole and a salsa duo. You designate the level of hotness you're yearning for and go from there. The guac is piled high, nice and chunky with a fresh air of citrus bursting throughout, you gotta love this stuff!

Also to be devoured are entr\u00e9es like mix and match tacos al carbon or my favorite, the Pescado en Salsa de Elote: wood-grilled, serrano-marinated fresh day-boat catch (last week's was swordfish) served with creamy fresh corn sauce infused with chilaca chiles. Ay Chihuahua!! Seriously delicious... the perfect mix of delicate and savory with bold and spicy flavors swimming around in a creamy, sweet dream of a sauce. It's utterly lovely.

avocado lime sorbet with blood oranges and tangerines, floating in a sparkling pomegranate broth - and it bombed. \u00a0The sorbet was weird and not refreshing. \u00a0It was okay flavor-wise, but the texture was weird and gummy, especially when it met the pomegranate soda water. \u00a0The fruit was fresh and lightly bitter, but none of the flavors really came together. \u00a0This was a disappointment.Still, we left Frontera happy customers and spent the better part of the afternoon walking off our lunch. \u00a0We'd decided beforehand to try both Frontera and Topolobampo, and the first meal left me excited for the second. \u00a0Hasta la vista, Sr. Bayless.", "Date": "2012-01-22", "Author_Location": "Los Angeles, CA"}, {"Author": "Ethan T.", "ReviewID": "jOvHhkmIs94UYzdeFUH_aQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If I designed the perfect restaurant it would turn out like frontera", "Date": "2013-07-04", "Author_Location": "Decatur, GA"}, {"Author": "Liz W.", "ReviewID": "jbQmSfSWp_X3nHiUWuw0PA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had the best margarita of my life in here, and the second best as well. I am lushy so I had to try two different kinds for variety. The Topolo margarita had Sauza Conmemorativo tequila, Torres orange liqueur, housemade limonada and was shaken tableside. It was my fave of the two varietals, being a true margarita taste. Smooth and just delicious. If you prefer a more sour margarita the Blue Agave should be your choice. I loved it too but two would likely send my pucker over the top. I started with that but my stomach was happier when I switched. Both were to die for yet totally different, neither had mixers or cheap ass tequila and were created to utter perfection. That alone makes me love the Frontera Grill.My experience here was some meh but still decent and some over the top OMG wow.For the meh:We started with a snobby dick of a bartender. We were like the fourth couple to come to the bar and after ten minutes still no margarita. I don't know if its because we were two women or he just didn't like our looks but we were sitting directly in front of the guy and he totally ignored us, even after I got out money to give him a clue we were thirsty ass lushes. I was a bit miffed after we had stood in line for quite awhile that I could not get a drink from a bar that had three guys mixing it up. He had the I'm too sexy thing going on and was never friendly to anyone he served, but hey I was jealous of them anyway because they had margaritas. Dude get over yourself. You missed out on money because I seriously overtip, just ask my sister. Also if you had ponied up I would have probably had three margaitas instead of two. Bad way to start an evening Mr. Bayless, it is mean to tease me like that. I made a mistake ordering one of our entrees. They have two carne asadas. Make sure you order the one with rib steak as the cheaper one with flank steak is just meh. Our order did have amazing sides (a shredded salad with jalapenos, an over the top tasty corncake with homemade crema and cheese, homemade tortillas and some delicious grilled knob onions), but the steak itself was not seasoned enough and was just nothing lighting up my tastebuds. If I had ordered it anywhere else I would have been fine but I really was disappointed here.I also was sad about the Verduras en Escabeche, which are homemade pickled jalapenos with carrots & cauliflower. We got ours and it was all jalapenos, I like jalapenos but c'mon, thats 2/3 of a dish missing and it made it just way too hot. I said something to our great waitress, Karla, about the lack of carrots and cauliflower because they were the main reason I ordered the dish. I am a total sucker for pickled carrots and cauliflower. She went back to the kitchen to score me some but they apparently had none, hmmm odd. She did offer graciously take the whole item off our bill which I appreciated. I was still a little disappointed though.Oh and the chips here, while homemade, were just too thick and not doing it for either of us.For the wow:Best.freaking.guac.ever. It was so creamy, so addictive, just rich and buttery. The tomatillo salsa was hands down the.best.I.have.ever.had. The other salsa was good but we devoured the green like nobody's business. It made upfor the chips, who cares when the dippers are this terrific.I did redeem myself with our other entree thank goodness. Costillas Enchipotladas, the.best.damn.ribs.ever. Sensing a theme here? They are chipotle glazed, lean yet tender. I looked up from eating at some point and my skinny sister had picked five bones clean already. That is a true testament to how good they were, she is usually a more petite eater than I am. We were still talking about this dish long after we were finished. It was served with some perfect black beans, smashed just a tad so they were a little creamy but not in any way soupy. These were thick and just my thing.Platanos con Crema here were amazing. Sweet fried plantains with homemade crema and fresh cheese. The salty/sweet thing always works for me. I loved these with the black beans from my rib dish.I was absolutely shocked at how delicious dessert here was. I never indulge this much usually but my sister again is a terrible influence and frankly it did not take any arm twisting. I figured after a three bottle of wine and shots the night before, well really why the hell not. The chocolate pecan pie here was lovely. I picked it and was fairly delighted with myself.

I ordered my duck cooked a little longer than normal - the waiter said it was usually medium-rare, and I asked for medium) and it was perfect. The sauce was complex, subtle, but enriching everything....I was expecting a spicy, knock-out, overpowering sauce, but I was completely floored and mistaken! The greens weren't at all bitter, and the vegetarian entree was so inventive and surprising. Who would have thought that you would find sesame and pumpkin seeds in this kind of cuisine????For dessert, we had a wonderful bread pudding topped with a carjeta (goat's milk) ice cream and a piece of chocolate pecan pie with impossibly flaky crust and Kahlua whipped cream. Speaking as a Southern girl who knows her way around pecan pie, it's simply not fair that a Yankee Mexican restaurant in Chicago should have the best pecan pie I've ever tasted.If you think that Mexican food is all about some mystery meat wrapped in a tortilla and disguised with cheese, then you need to visit Frontera.

We started with Margaritas - My wife selected the Vanilla Margarita with Cazadores Blanco Taquila infused with Mexican vanilla and Hoja Santa leaves, 10-year-old Torres Brandy, agave syrup and fresh squeezed limonada. \u00a0Being a pepper lover, I selected the Margarita Yucateca with Milagro Blanco 100% Agave Tequila, fresh squeezed lime and orange, organic cane juice infused with roasted Habanero. \u00a0See, that's what I am talking about! \u00a0 Our drinks were mixed and shaken right there at the table and they were extravagantly delicious. \u00a0 This was the start of a world class food adventure! \u00a0We then ordered the Ceviche Yucateco steamed organic shrimp and calimari tossed with lime, orange, habanero, avocado, jimcaya and cilantro with Tortilla chips, as well as Ensalada Frontera a mixture of young seasonal greens with wood-grilled onions, radishes, fresh home-made cheese (!!!!!!), and roasted garlic dressing. \u00a0 \u00a0Yet before our first food arrived, my wireless tag with led lights went off indicating that our table was open. \u00a0 So we cleared our bar side tab, told them where to deliver the food (table 42) and we were seated at a fantastic table where I could see right into the open kitchen. \u00a0 Pure heaven as I love stuff like this! \u00a0 As soon as we were seated, Jonathan assisted us the rest of the night, and he had our starters ready as soon as we sat down. \u00a0 Jonathan provided outstanding service, took the photo of us with Chef Rick Bayless and even told us some of the secrets of what he called their food; \u00a0\"Reconstructed Southern Mexican Gourmet\", as being the fresh and organic ingredients they select from local farmers. \u00a0Jonathan also helped us make some selections based on my request for \"Chef Bayless's Favorites\". \u00a0 We dined on Tamal de Chivo - Banana leaf wrapped tamal(e) filled with slow cooked Pleasant Meadows Boer goat barbacoa with spicy red chile Guajilla sauce, pickled carrot-beet salad and queso anejo. \u00a0 As well as a wonderfully, beautifully presented crispy Taquitos Pollo de \u00a0Ahumado filled with smoked chicken and poblanos, served with home-made sour cream (!!!!!!), salsa verde, anejo cheese and guacamole. \u00a0 To add our fish we selected the Cazeula de atun cherrywood smoked Hawaiian Ahi Tuna simmered with three-chile salsa, roasted butternut and Chayote with a frisee-watercress salad. \u00a0We then ended with their final available plate of the day, Chef Bayless's own favorite, chile relleno (which does not appear to be on their menu). \u00a0In summary, Chef Bayless's cuisine is the finest Mexican style I have ever eaten, and I live in Texas, so I have had my share of mexican for decades. \u00a0 I've also eaten at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in NYC, and to me, Bayless's food is better. \u00a0And I told him that. \u00a0 It has a heat level to respect, and it is true world class, and very unique. \u00a0AAA+++", "Date": "2009-01-13", "Author_Location": "College Station, TX"}, {"Author": "Mike G.", "ReviewID": "OvsO0I1VRtG0x0ga2y-r7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The entire night was perfect...probably because I was drunk half way into the dinner.

I guess the server wanted to challenge my fiance because he came back with a small dish filled with some other type of salsa. \u00a0Our server told him \"I notice you like spicy stuff I brought you this salsa let's hope this is hot enough for you.\" \u00a0The salsa consisted of chile de arbol with lime juice and boy was it spicy but soooooooo good. \u00a0I'll be honest when I first read the menu I thought well this sounds like my mom can do this. \u00a0I thought the steak would be a skirt steak....

Our second and third tastes from the platter were \"Jicama Callejera,\" and \"Tostaditas de Ceviche.\" While my sister didn't really appreciate the pineapple I personally thought the salad was excellent in flavor but could've used more textural variation. \u00a0The ceviche, on the other hand, was a winner in the opinions of us both with the heavily acidic flavor of the meaty marlin smoothed out by the bitter olives while the combination of chopped tomato, ham, jicama, and cilantro added a salsa-esque texture to the well done fish.The final two components of the platter were a relatively boring (albeit tasty) guacamole with perfectly prepared tortilla chips and \"Quesadillas Capitalinas\" - \u00a0Mexico City-style corn masa turnovers stuffed with Samuels locally handcrafted Jack cheese and fresh epazote. \u00a0Biting into the puffs and met by a rush of gooey, smoky, and pungent cheese I was quite pleased and believe this was my favorite item on the platter.With plates collected we began the 45 minute wait that would seperate us from our main courses.Sapitos - a trio of Xalapa-style gorditas (corn masa cakes) in chipotle-black bean sauce each with its own topping: scrambled eggs, grilled chicken, chorizo and plantains; homemade crema and queso fresco. \u00a0While certainly not as visually appealing as French cuisine, the myriad colors were definitely noteworthy with eye catching yellows contrasting with blacks, whites, and orange. \u00a0Tasting each of her gorditas, however, was somewhat disappointing with only the chorizo and plantains standing out and all three being luke-warm at best...as a matter of fact, the eggs were downright cold. \u00a0While I realize the place was busy, from a place receiving such acclaim this isn't really acceptableHot Cakes Indgenas featuring two Iroquois white corn pancakes with whipped goat cheese, piloncillo-agave syrup, grilled bacon and two eggs sunny-side up. \u00a0Arriving with hot eggs, cool bacon, and luke-warm pancakes this dish once again showed a step of mistiming from the kitchen but thankfully didn't suffer as much as my sister's dish. \u00a0Tasting like thin and 'almost' crispy cornbread I loved the taste and texture of the pancakes and found them further complimented by the complex and airy whipped goat cheese that tasted like a creamy sweet butter with almond tones. \u00a0Topping the pancakes with an ample helping of the minimally bitter yet entirely smooth agave syrup was another bonus. \u00a0As the eggs were organic farm eggs and served piping hot I perforated the yolk of one and allowed it to soak into the pancake while I ate the other sans-addition. \u00a0The final part of the dish, the locally sourced thick-cut hickory bacon was excellent and not at all overcooked - but as mentioned it was cold.While I realize Frontera has been a big deal for years there is no doubt they've benefited recently from Chef Bayless' win on TCM - or perhaps they've become a little overwhelmed and this may explain the inconsistency from the kitchen in terms of temperature and timing? \u00a0While I cannot be sure, I've no doubt the restaurant will continue to do well and I have much respect for the Chef's attention to organics and the slowfood movement. \u00a0In the end some dishes were excellent while others were somewhat average - in general I guess I'm just not a fan of Mexican or Latin cuisine. \u00a0All told I enjoyed Frontera but do not think I'd rush back - and I certainly wouldn't wait more than thirty minutes for a table.", "Date": "2009-09-20", "Author_Location": "Las Vegas, NV"}, {"Author": "Kiki P.", "ReviewID": "NkV7fmoJMIxL0ubCkaW01g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent food and pleasant atmosphere.

And I should have known better than to get too excited about anywhere with this much hype. I must say, that's probably why I wasn't overwhelmed; my expectations were simply set too high. First off, the food. Frontera has just put out a new menu, centered on shared food, tapas-style eating. With our group of three, that sounded good, and we followed our waiters' directions in ordering about 2 items per person. And we were drowning in food. It was mostly delicious, but things like the sweet potatoes with bacon weren't really worth it. The duck flautas were probably my favorite item, rich and delicately spicy. The shredded beef enchiladas were also good, but not fantastically so. The mole we tried was also excellent. But again, just not the world-changing experience that, say, the goat barbacoa torta at Xoco was. We even tried the goat barbacoa queso fundido, but the queso totally overwhelmed, and I felt like it was a little overwhelming. Perhaps that was the problem: everything was just a tad too much, trying a little too hard. That's not to say it wasn't bloody delicious, and I didn't eat a lot of it. It just wasn't the life altering moment that I wanted it to be. And yes, it does have genuine Mexican flavors and spices, in a way that most traditional Americanized Mexican food in the U.S. does not. Secondly, the drinks. We had a blood orange margarita that was pretty phenomenal, and then switched to beer. The drinks are delicious and reasonably priced. It was the first time I've had a margarita that didn't seem to involve any mixes, and that made me happy.Thirdly, the service. Our waiter was totally charming. And though he might have told us to order more food than we could possibly eat, he was considerate, answered all questions, and obviously really enjoys his job. As for the wait, we were going on Friday night. We stopped in to put our name on the list at about 6 PM, and were told it would be 2 hours. We had planned ahead and expected that kind of wait, so it was no big deal. When we stopped back by at 7 PM just to check in, following a drink at a nearby spot, they were ready for us. It was pretty well-timed, and the fact that we didn't have to wait in the restaurant the whole time was definitely appreciated. The atmosphere is a little hectic, and one doesn't exactly feel like sitting and hanging out would be appreciated. And while that is fine at Xoco, where street food and a bit of a rush feel naturally coordinated and hand-in-hand, that's a little more bothersome at Frontera, when you're dropping considerably more cash and might appreciate a little bit of a relaxed tone. All in all, it was definitely worth experiencing Frontera once.

The weather was beautiful and we had the option of sitting outside but preferred to sit inside to get the whole frontera experience.

We started with the much talked about guacamole and chips, I thought it was good, very good, but not out of this world amazing, so I probably wouldn't get it again. The chips and the red salsa was to die for, one of the best salsa's I've ever had, so next time, all about the salsa. We got the skirt steak tacos with sauteed onions and guacamole as one entree which was alright, nothing out of the ordinary and we had the Chile Poblano enchiladas which was my favorite entree there, a bit spicy, the mole had a unique flavor and it was a fun dish to try.

We made our reservation one month ago, and were very excited for our meal.We really enjoyed our margaritas and our trio trio trio -- the kind of quality ingredients and preparation that your restaurant deserves. We were incredibly upset with our service. Our entrees took one whole hour to come out after we had been served our appetizer. And our waiter did not check on us between the time that our appetizer was served, and our entrees were almost finished. This would have barely been ok, except that our goat entree (Tuesday night special) was much too salty. Too salty for even salt-lovers like us. We enjoy salt, but this seemed like a fatal flaw and ruined the whole dish and its complexity and thoughtfulness, which might have been the most upsetting part. Since our waiter never once checked up on us, we were frustrated that we could not even send it back for a replacement. By the time he came to our table, we were so frustrated with the meal that we just wanted to leave. We had been so excited about ordering a third drink for both of us as well as dessert, but were disgusted by the service and felt like going home. So, we were very upset that the service was awful for your caliber of restaurant, and both of our entrees had problems. The goat was so salty that we are still reeling, two hours later. I enjoyed my flank steak, but it came out cool, which affected the texture of the meat. But the flavors were delicious though, so I shall not complain about that dish!Both of the tables on either side of us were overheard complaining about the service. It really is a shame that our server disappeared for one whole hour. Had he been attentive and made time to wait on us, we would have had a very good experience. Now, I am afraid that I do not even want to go back. My husband and I love regional Mexican cuisine, and we are endeared by your personality both online, in print, and on television. I am afraid that your celebrity status has overshadowed the quality of Frontera Grill. It is unfortunate that the substance upon which you were lucky enough to gain recognition in the food industry has been replaced by the kind of cow call reserved for tourist hotspots, with the service to match.

Where to go? i could visit old standbys, or try something new. I almost gave up on trying to go to Frontera Grill as I wasn't able to get a reservation - but my dining companion was game for a long wait and we figured there were plenty of other nearby options if we were thwarted in our quest. Frontera Grill it was, and what a wonderful decision. The food is glorious. Absolutely everything we ate was impeccable and bright and flavorful. We started with the guacamole. The guacamole is good ... of course the guacamole is good. But want to know what's better? The tomatillo salsa. I know, you're thinking, salsa? Seriously? You go out for high-end Mexican food and you want to talk about salsa? LET ME TELL YOU 'BOUT THIS SALSA. It has this crazy depth of flavor that will leave you neglecting your awesomely delicious guacamole so that you can sit and ponder what has gone into it. (Later, your waiter will be happy to tell you. But give up because you'll never manage to recreate it at home, you'll just have to move to Chicago.) It managed to outshine our second appetizer, a deliciously light jicama salad that I would have considered a triumph at any other meal. Alas, at this table, it became only an afterthought! (A delicious afterthought, though, you should totally order it.)For my entree I had the carne asada. It was served with sweet plantains, guacamole, and black beans. I learned something from this entree: I like black beans! I have never in my life enjoyed them, but after being happy with everything I'd eaten so far in my meal I decided to be brave and try them. Et voila! A new food I like to add to my repertoire. Thanks, Rick Bayless, for changing my mind about beans. Everything else on the plate was delicious and my steak was a perfect medium-rare - impressive since it was a fairly thin cut of beef. My dining companion was a vegetarian and while the options available to her were somewhat limited, she was very happy with her tacos with mushrooms. Our waiter noted her choice of entree and asked if she was vegetarian, he noted that the beans are cooked in pork and was quick to offer up alternatives. We both finished up our meal with a dessert of a duo of flans - while I am usually a fan of chocolate, the vanilla flan totally stole the show. By the time we left you could have rolled us home, but we wouldn't have missed a bite of it. Service was great. Our waiter was incredibly attentive even though he waTs also taking care of a table of 10 seated next to us. I was very impressed by the attentiveness of everyone, from the hostess to the manager in the dining room (who noticed my half-empty waterglass from across the room and had someone en route to replenish before I'd even gotten the glass down). And to top it all off? Rick Bayless was IN THE KITCHEN! With a chef of his fame and caliber I never expect that they've actually had a hand in making my food happen, but it appears that on this night I was wrong!

We got in right away because of our reservation. Sat down and enjoyed what seemed to be a tic tac container full of nuts.We ordered a few appetizers. We were not impressed. Ordered some more appetizers thinking the others might be better. Not so much.For some reason, everytime I asked for a straw it always seemed like they were rinced off and reused because there was always water/condensation on the inside of the straw. After the third set, I asked the waitress about it and she said they were a bio-degradable type of straw so that is why it looked like that. I said no way there is water inside it and she said that they sit right next to the bar where they can get wet. I thought that was a little strange. I hate drinking out of public glasses in restaurants. Yet when I looked around, I did not notice anyone else with straws in any of their drinks.I asked for a hotter sauce than what they brought me and I end up getting charged almost 3 bucks for about an ounce of habanero sauce they called salsa. I could not believe that. If I asked for salsa then I could see getting charged for it, but this is ridiculous. I was expecting the appetizers to be amazing and it was just average.After 4 different appetizers we decided to leave. There is no point in ordering a whole meal if the appetizers are just ok in a hyped-up restaurant as packed and supposedly famous as this one.Needless to say we left disappointed and hungry still.

After a pleasant wait enjoying the fab weather and chatting with other Bayless fans, we were invited in promptly at 5:00, given a pager and scored 2 seats at the bar.

The busboy was also very efficient and friendly. We never felt rushed even though the place was pretty full and lots of people were waiting in the bar area. For the most part, the food was awesome. Do not go here expecting typical Mexican restaurant portions - this is all about quality not quantity. The food is sophisticated and high quality. We started with the pork empanadas which featured a smoky pork filling and crispy exterior that contrasted nicely with the avocado sauce and tangy watercress salad. We also had the ceviche trio. Loved the presentation in little martini style glasses.

We'll definitely get a larger portion of this on a return visit.For entrees, I had the seafood of the day - a grilled swordfish with veracruz sauce. The fish was moist, flavorful, with a nice grilled taste. It was accompanied by disappointing mash (very watery not creamy) and pickled green beans and carrots that were al dente but spicy. Hubby had the special - very tender shredded suckling pig served with tasty black beans and fresh tortillas on the side.

The mahi tasted very fresh and tomatillo sauce was very lively.guac: 4 stars-creamy and flavorful. Comes with their very tasty green and red salsas.Entreessteak tacos: 5 stars-the steak was juicy, flavorful, tender, carmelized onions...yuuuum! too bad it was only one taco. pretty small for $20pork belly and pork loin in chipotle black bean sauce: 5 stars!!! the pork belly LITERALLY melts in your mouth. I've never had pork belly this smooth and fatty delicious before. OMG I wish I'd ordered this.flank steak with sweet corn tamales: 4 stars-steak came with a salsa that was spicy and delicious. It wasn't nearly as juicy as the steak in the tacos but I was happy with my choice. The sweet corn tamale was very good. extremely fresh tasting and worked well with the sour cream and cilantro.Mole with chicken: 2.5 stars-nothing special which was really disappointing because I thought Rick Bayless was famous for his mole and his oaxacan sauces.A few people ordered the same thing and obviously if I ruled the world we would've all ordered different things. Alas, sadly I don't get my way all the time.DrinksGold Margarita: 3.5 delicious, fresh and not too sweetMexican mojito: 4 good but I couldn't pick out what made it MexiccanMichelada: 4.5 the best michelada I've ever had.

The dish was served with black beans, sweet plantains (my favorite) and guacamole. While it probably wasn't my favorite cut of beef, the rib steak was was tender and well complimented by the sides.

So, we wanted to make reservations but after reading that they had to be made so far ahead of time, we decided to just get there a little bit early and hope to be seated early. So, on a cold, rainy Saturday morning, we took a cab from our hotel and arrived at the restaurant at 10:15AM and there was already a line of about 20 people ahead of us. We were so excited for the food. The decor inside is cute--lots of oranges, purples and nothing too fancy. As soon as we sat down, we realized how quickly the restaurant filled up. The ambiance was ok--there was a lot of background noise-- but then again, the tables are so close to each other you can hear other couples' conversations. Our waitress seemed to have grown up in Mexico but spoke English fluently. However, she seemed overwhelmed. We asked fo hot sauce but it never got to our table. Now, for the food... we ordered the taquitos for appetizer; I ordered the tacos al carbon with the grilled skirt steak; my husband, the egg and sausage enthusiast, got the Huevos Estilo El Bajo. The taquitos were forgettable. My husband'sdish was submerged in a green sauce and was \"sprinkled\" with the chorizo. He also said there was some pungent cheese in the dish and he honestly did not enjoy it that much. As for the tacos, however, the meat was grilled perfectly, the tortilla was amazing and again, the red hot sauce is amazing. Lastly, we ordered dessert. I never get dessert and my husband only gets flan when he does, but, we decided that we wanted to try the dessert yesterday and honestly, it was by far the best dessert we've ever had. We had the chocolate cake with brownie chunk ice cream and raspberry cream. The cake was really very very light and fluffy and not too sweet. It was absolutely delicious and everything on the plate--from the ice cream to the raspberries were just as good. So, in summary, I would only give it 3 stars if it were just based on the appetizer and the entrees but seriously, the cake is worth an entire whole star by itself.

They had a nice crispy exterior and come with homemade sour cream and fresh cheese. \u00a0Delicious! I could have eaten 2 or 3 orders of this.1. Guacamole - pretty good, with some sort of fresh red pepper mixed in, but it was a tad on the bland side. It could have used some salt and possibly some lemon juice. I like the guac at Qdoba as much or better. 2. Chicken taquitos - these were good, but not so different than your typical taquitos. They do come mounted on a nice little mound of guacamole which added to the value.3. \u00a0Falda Asada \"Brava\": \u00a0 \u00a0spicy serrano-marinated grass fed flank steak (from Bill Kurtis's Tall Grass) with spicy salsa huevona (hand-crushed, grill-roasted tomatoes, jalapenos). Grilled knob onions and sweet corn tamales (topped with homemade sour cream and fresh cheese). \u00a029.00 \u00a0I'm not a big steak guy, but this was pretty good. To be frank though, I enjoyed the sweet corn tamales more than the steak itself. It certainly wasn't worth $29.4. \u00a0Tacos al Carbon: \u00a0wood-grilled meat, poultry, fish or mushrooms sliced and served with roasted pepper rajas, two salsas, frijoles charros, guacamole and homemade tortillas. \u00a016.50 \u00a0We had these tacos with pineapple pork, but we could not really taste the pineapple and so I think these were fairly mediocre. The corn tortillas that accompanied the meal were good and fresh which I enjoyed.

Everything was super tasty and stood out with the delicious sauces that is a signature of Bayless' cooking. For dessert we went with the pastel de chocolate and the hot chocolate.

The fresh-squeezed OJ and spiced coffee (with brown sugar) was a great way to start the day. We then tried the appeitizer sampler platter which included the cheese quesadilla, chicken taquitos, ceviche, and jicama salad. Everything on the platter was wonderful down to the gaucamole. The quesadillas were not your norm, with wonderful corn shells turned over great cheese. Taquitos were great and the ceviche was prefectly marinated marlin on small corn chips. A great start. For entrees, the hot corn cakes with agave syrup were terrific and the sapitos offered three little cakes,each topped with different things. One offered great scrambled eggs, one was chorizo, and one was grilled chicken with tomatillo sauce.

I enjoy salt however the salsa the rice the black beans even the sopes would've been much more enjoyable without all the salt! I was also disappointed that when the manager gave us the bill all he said was \"I didn't charge you for the enchiladas.\" duh I didn't eat them why would you charge me? What I wish he had done was ask for feedback why didn't I like them or say hey I tried them you were right the sauce was entirely made of salt not black beans something to show that they actually gave a damn about their guests experience. Also just another suggestion even if a guest is running towards the door with their screaming child, or if you don't agree with them that anything was wrong with the dish, make them an item they can take with them so they have an enjoyable last memory of the place. Positives I really enjoyed the guacamole and the sopes, I know I said the sopes were too salty but they were very delicious, our son also loved them! The red salsa was good, for children, it was so mild that our 18 month old son was drinking it! Sadly they didn't sell it in a jar we really wanted to buy some for him. My wife ordered the mole which has been One of the dishes by Rick bayless that I've wanted to try for the last 10-13 years and wow was it good!! Thankfully it was too much food for my wife to eat so I was able to have most of it! Perfection! So well balanced, I could eat that over and over again and not get bored! My favorite aspect was that unlike so many moles, no flavors over powered the dish. I've had too many moles where the flavors are so disconnected that you can identify all 21 ingredients and I've had others where one spice over powered the whole dish, however this mole was perfect! I honestly can't recall any ingredient it was just mole, as it should be! Our server was a very nice guy, though he kept calling our son she, he was quick to take our order and when we had to leave he quickly ran our card for us, he was also very apologetic about the enchiladas. I really appreciated that he tried to help me find an appropriate jarred salsa for our son. Over all I'm very happy I experienced Frontera grill, and had it been any other restaurant I probably would've been overjoyed and given it 4-5 stars. However since I was expecting more and know that they could've done much better, to know this just go to xoco, I will only give it 3 stars. I'm just very disappointed that they let me leave without trying to make everything better. Customers should never leave a place unhappy! On a side note as we rounded the corner we saw the line at xoco had disappeared so we went in and had the most incredible chocolates and churros! I thought I was too full, I guess not.

After all was said and done, it was a total letdown. Never regretted spending $150 more. Let's go through it step by step:1. Chips and salsa - the chips were decent, you could tell they were freshly made. That's pretty much where it ends. The salsa was bland! I've made better salsa at home.2. Guacamole - B-L-A-N-D. not a chili pepper in the whole dish. Onion was used for garnish, not flavor. We used the lime garnish off our drinks AND added salt just to make it edible.3. Mole enchiladas - one note - sweet. No depth to the flavor, barely any spice. Any good mole is supposed to be a revolving flavor experience (sweet, spicy, creamy savory). Not this sauce. It wouldn't have surprised me if someone said it came out of a can. or jar. Not to mention - the chicken inside the enchilada was not seasoned AT ALL. It basically tasted like it had been boiled and shredded. Our local family mexican restaurant in Long Beach makes better mole.4. Steak - ok, nothing amazing. It was cooked properly. Definitely better than the mole (although we've already established that bar was pretty low). This steak came with another salsa - tasted like it may have been a fire roasted tomato salsa. It was ok, but also bland overall. Needed some heat. The best thing on that plate was the sweet corn tamale. That \u00a0being said, it was only marginally better than the sweet corn cake you get with every meal at an El Torito in California.5. Dessert (yes we ordered dessert - still waiting for the magic to happen) - chocolate pecan pie. Utterly forgettable. Clawingly sweet. Dry crust. So sad to have walked away from this meal with this experience. Based on this, we would never eat at a Rick Bayless restaurant again. At the very least, the food should be on par with your average family mexican restaurant on the west coast. Considering the price point and the reputation, it should have been amazing. It was not.", "Date": "2012-07-24", "Author_Location": "Long Beach, CA"}, {"Author": "Ben V.", "ReviewID": "ib-eOgOUvMJnD0jswzoeOg", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Honestly, before visiting Chicago, I never heard the name Rick Bayless. I had heard of his brother, Skip Bayless, the generally disliked and criticized sports analyst. But with Rick's name splattered all over the place and on the hotel information TV channel, I figured we had to try it. We attempted to visit late one evening but left when told the wait was about 2 hours (at 9:30 on a weekday). Never mind that there was no one waiting and about 3 tables were empty on the patio. We came back at noon the following day and were seated right away in the casual side labeled Frontera Grill. Immediately I suspected the food quality to drop significantly for Frontera patrons rather than Topolobampo customers.  We ordered the chips and salsa which were a good representation of Mexican flavors and were fairly authentic. They served a verde and a red salsa.We ordered three plates to share. First the grill roasted corn with Serrano cilantro mayo and cheese. Sounds fancy, but it is basically a lot of cilantro and tiny bit of Serrano and mayo in a food processor. It had zero spice or heat which means there was little or no Serrano added. This was slathered across roasted corn-on-the-cob and sprinkled with queso fresco. It was just okay but only $4.50 so I can't complain there.Next was the sopes rancheros; \"crispy\" corn boats with beef, tomato, and avocado. What it really was? Four bite sized soggy corn boats with shredded beef covered in red chile/tomato sauce with mini specs of avocado. They tasted alright, but definitely not as advertised. You get overwhelmed by the thick corn masa.Finally, our last small plate was the Chicken in Poblano Crema. Grilled chicken with roasted poblanos and potatoes in homemade sour cream sauce. What it really was? Flavorless small chicken cubes, with large chunks of potato, mixed with tons of spinach (where was that in the description, Rick?), and about 3 or 4 tiny strips of poblano served in a 4-inch by 2-inch mini skillet accompanied by 3-inch mini corn tortillas. You can make about 4 mini soft tacos but that's it. I would say about 65% of the skillet was spinach. I spent my time searching for chicken, finding a piece, and then realizing it was a potato. The sour cream sauce was bland. You want this at home? Cook 1/3 of a chicken breast, cut into cubes. Cut potatoes in bigger cubes about 2 to 1 in number to the chicken. Grab a handful of spinach. Cut 4 pieces of half inch by half inch poblanos. Mix sour cream with chicken broth. Mix all ingredients, put in oven until potatoes are soft. Enjoy.I've eaten at many very nice and expensive restaurants in many different cities throughout Mexico. Frontera flavors are NOT authentic. Either Rick Bayless is in it for the money, or he only puts effort into his Topolobampo restaurant.Regardless, I don't see any Bayless restaurants in Houston, Dallas, Las Vegas, Miami, etc. etc. where Mexican food is well known and very popular--might be a clue.", "Date": "2012-08-16", "Author_Location": "Oklahoma City, OK"}, {"Author": "Andrew Y.", "ReviewID": "cB5tXLKCfEWVxzwJkqxqmg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "im actually a big fan of this place for a few things...1. \u00a0the expectation that a real well known chef in chicago is going to deliver a solid meal2. \u00a0the hope that maybe one day i actually grow a pair and go to topolabamba3. \u00a0the jicama salad4. \u00a0the huevos rancheros or any breakfast option they havei guess what id do if i was you..is sit in the bar area..its double the size of the dining room and its first come first serve..the chips and salsa are a 4 star..but they do not ever give you enough...i am a huge fan of any breakfast dish they cook there and you must get the jicama salad..its perfect spice..the drinks are pretty small..but the ice tea is good...its a loud and energetic atmosphere and i nominate the waiter that i always get for one of the best in chicago...once i figure out his name i will throw it up here..he's top notch..the decor is cool...the menu is small but its a secondary restaurant to its mothership downstairs..i cant speak for that since i havent been yet..but i hear that its really good..dont go here for tacos..i made that mistake one time..they are overpriced and small...but do come here to try their dishes from the yucatan..these are actually good.", "Date": "2009-05-05", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Tim B.", "ReviewID": "ggSTJ6YdGl8gXjXBRNbTtA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Went to Frontera last week and I will break it down Positives: Server was great very attentive quick to get our drink orders, Drinks were expensive but worth the $10 price tag We had a table of 6 people we ordered 3 entrees and 8 small plates/appetizers , we made it a point to attempt to try all styles food, entrees we had the Atlantic salmon which was OK but small and I have had better many other places, the chili rellanos - the server saved some of this \"special dish\" for us I wish he would not have the breading on the outside was bland and flavorless, and the 3rd entree was the enchiladas not very adventurous and mediocre at best.

He was attentive and quick to help us refine our choices. Great services overall. 2) Drinks - we all had negra modelos which is never a bad choice. 3) Food - definitely the reason we came and definitely the reason why my group and I were disappointed. Nothing about the food stood out - yes it was \"good\" but hardly worthy of the warning of a \"30 day waiting list for reservations\" and the consensus amongst my friends. I had the tacos al carbon, while the others in my group had the carne asada and pescado a la veraniega. We all agreed that the food was fine, but we didn't understand the hype surrounding the place. Maybe it was the luck of the draw or maybe Frontera's reputation has more to do with Rick Bayless than the actual quality of the food.

This place is the pf changs of mexican food.Came here a few months ago after hearing how great it was (Rick Bayless did win Top Chef Masters, as I was told), and since I was feeling homesick (I'm from Austin, tx) and really really wanted some good mexican food, decided to give it a shot. I came here with two friends and we were all less than satisfied upon leaving.Their margaritas were pretty good, I will give them that.Anyways, we ordered the appetizer sampler which came with guac, empanadas, jicama, and some other unmemorable things. It was alright, but not great, the empanadas tasted one step better than stuff from the freezer section of the grocery store.The real disaster came when I got my entree, the mole duck breast with corn fritters. When it came out everything just looked limp and sad (I questioned whether it had been sitting under a heat lamp). I had a bite or two and it was not good. The texture of the duck was meh, the mole was too too sweet, with no flavor, and the fritters were soggy. I was willing to give it a few more bites before giving it it axe, but at the next one, I chewed into something that had the texture of what I can best describe as a thin rubberband so I spit it out. Upon inspection of all the other slices, I noticed this thick white ribbon going through all of them (what I assume was just really thick silverskin) so when the waitress came back, I told her about it and she took by plate away and didn't charge me for it (which was very nice, I will give them that as well). Any legitimate restaurant should know to remove silverskin from meat before cooking. Even though she took the duck off our check, we still ended up paying about $200 between the three of us in the end. There are much better mexican places around town at cheaper prices.I'm hoping that the reason it was so disappointing is that Rick Bayless is doing so many other things that he doesn't have time to check the quality of all his restaurants regularly and not that he doesn't know how to make mexican food worth shit.", "Date": "2012-02-23", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "Chef J.", "ReviewID": "e6xTPt9Ixd11SGvMYDM33g", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can never tire of this colorful sumptuous place. \u00a0The ceviche is tangy and balanced with the freshest of fish. \u00a0The sauces are always deeply intriguing. \u00a0How can you resist the blood orange margaritas, even if they kill you at $12 a pop. \u00a0We had sopas with braised beef and goat taquitos that were a great counter to the bright ceviche.", "Date": "2012-04-06", "Author_Location": "Madison, WI"}, {"Author": "Dave P.", "ReviewID": "W2kCzqAiSYXIpoSiZO19LQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pretty disappointed with our experience.

The restaurant experience was everything you want for a special occassion. \u00a0The restaurant is full of people of all types, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and they clearly stress a pretension-free atmosphere from the staff.

One thing is that good Mexican is never far away.Rick Bayless, as a primer, was studying for a PhD in linguistics at the University of Michigan, when he moved to Meixco from 1980-1986. There, he learnt Mexican cooking, and then brought it back to Chicago. When Obama was inaugurated, Rick Bayless was apparently in the running to be White House executive chef.I've been to Frontera twice now. (and XOCO 4 times). So far, I have not been disappointed.(Brunch)Chilaquiles al Guajillo (5/5) - \"Quick-simmered tortilla \"casserole\" with rustic red guajillo chile sauce, homemade crema, aged Mexican cheese (queso anejo), sunny-side up egg. Tangy baby greens.\" Savory and fresh greens, great tasting sauce. Tortillas were semi-crisp - after sitting in sauce, they were a delicious mess.Duo de Flanes (4.25/5) - \"A duo of caramel custards: coconut milk-lemongrass flan with honey Manila mango salsa, plus silky Mexican vanilla. \" had a rich, sticky texture, in the region of peanut-butter stickiness. The custard cake contrasted well with the mango and wisps of coconut.(Dinner)Lamb Shoulder in Black Mole (4.5/5) - \"Grill-seared lamb shoulder braised in black mole, Nichols Farm potatoes, grilled calabacitas, anejo cheese.\" Mole means sauce in Mexican. For this dish, I believe the \"mole\" here is a chocolate sauce. It was rich, and there were quite a few potatoes in the dish. It went excellently with tacos - the only minor complaint might be that the potato-lamb ratio was skewed in favour of potato.Duck \"Carnitas\" Flautas (4.5/5) - \"Crispy, crunchy taquitos of slow-cooked duck carnitas, (grilled white onions, garlic mojo). Tangy red chile escabeche, orange \"shoots salad.\"Ceviche Trio - \"Frontera Ceviche (albacore, tomato, olive), Yucatecan Ceviche (shrimp, squid, orange, cucumber), Tropical Tuna Cocktail (big eye, avocado-tomatillo, mango salsa)\"Yucatan Ceviche (4.75/5) - nice and limey, good contrast with shrimp and squidTropical Tuna Cocktail (5/5) - out of this world, perfectly salted avocado. Sweet mango complemented tuna perfectlyFrontera Ceviche (4/5) - another sour one.Smoky-Creamy-Spicy Mushrooms (4.75/5) - \"Brown beech, hedgehog, oyster, shiitake & black trumpet mushrooms, white sweet potato, Oaxacan pasilla crema, epazote.\"Verdict: Just go.

My date's taco trio was much more satisfying, though only four tortillas for a HUGE platter of food was a joke. \u00a0He ate more than half with his fork. \u00a0Meanwhile at the bar, two of the bartenders got into a fight. \u00a0One guy started yelling at the other after getting accidentally bumped, and the whole thing escalated until one was backing the other against the wall, they were yelling until their faces were red, and I was certain we were about to see them go to blows. \u00a0FINALLY after FAR too long, another bartender came in and broke it up, and we missed the dinner entertainment. \u00a0I was so bewildered by this whole fiasco that I didn't even notice when Rick Bayless himself scooted in right next to me on the bench seat against the wall to chat with a group of friends. \u00a0Suddenly dozens of people needed to use the restroom so that they had a reason to walk by the table to take a picture of him. \u00a0Our table also started getting lots of attention from the waiters and hostess, trying to look more attentive, since he was sitting right next to us. \u00a0Amusing, really.Dessert was a chocolate peanut butter cheesecake with a mango-chile sorbet/salsa. \u00a0These were both delicious in their own right, though had no business being paired together. \u00a0They were still the highlight of the meal when eaten separately, and the chocolate cappuccino was also very good. \u00a0It did make me rather sad that the best thing we ate at this notorious Mexican restaurant was a chocolate peanut butter cheesecake. \u00a0So that was our night. \u00a0We waited, we ate, we saw Rick Bayless. \u00a0Would I wait three hours for this food again? \u00a0No way, Jose. \u00a0Would I have given it 4-5 stars if I had made reservations and had been seated within 30 minutes? \u00a0Moot point, because I don't really think it's worth coming again. \u00a0Bucket list item checked off. \u00a0There's a whole city full of amazing food in Chicago, and I'm sure I can find better on my next visit.", "Date": "2013-04-30", "Author_Location": "Elk Grove, CA"}, {"Author": "Sarah F.", "ReviewID": "4wy8HIzQPWx6lhYcUwdNRg", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having been to the other Rick Bayless Mecca, Topolobampo, several times, I was eager to dine at Frontera Grill (finally!) and compare the two. \u00a0Although both boast authentic Mexican, the concepts of the two are entirely different. \u00a0My trips to Topolobampo were excellent, but I found Frontera's menu and service to be much more approachable and fun. \u00a0Delicious and rustic Mexican (like we all know) at its absolute best, hands down. \u00a0They don't call Rick Bayless the king of Mexican in the U.S. for nothing. \u00a0 The margaritas, shaken tableside, are not to miss. \u00a0And the guacamole is probably the BEST I'd ever had (there was some kind of roasted pepper bits in the guac - I swear! - which was an unusual and amazing twist). \u00a0Simple, well-made and wonderfully flavored Mole enchiladas were my entree of choice. \u00a0Loved them! \u00a0There were really well-done basics on the menu, \u00a0as well as a few more elegant-style dishes such as duck tacos or barbacoa w/ pineapple, OR Chef Bayless' famed Tongue Tacos, as see on Top Chef Masters. \u00a0Yum Yum. \u00a0My only complaint - NO RESERVATIONS! \u00a0The cattle line up like crazy for this place, and when it opened at 5, and we got there at 5:05, we were already up to 2 hr wait for 2 people. \u00a0We waited a full 2 hrs too. \u00a0It was worth it thought - but annoying at the same time. \u00a0Just accept a reservation why don't ya!?", "Date": "2009-08-01", "Author_Location": "Chicago, IL"}, {"Author": "L.

You still have to wait until 5:20 to eat at the bar of 5:30 to sit in the dining room. Why you ask? Because the \"kitchen doesn't want to be slammed all at the same time?\" ARe you kidding me? They only have about 20 tables in the whole room, it that. But regardless, I think the whole thing is orchestrated to get you to sit in the bar and buy drinks. I made it a point to see if the first people in line were seated right at the time they opened and even THEY had to wait 10 minutes to get seated. I am boycotting this place.

Every single time I visited Chi-town, Frontera Grill was top, on my list of restaurants to visit. Unfortunately, every single time, we were unable to do so. Either it was all booked-up or the wait was too long. We finally made it this time, after a two and half hour wait. Third time lucky, don't they say ! My experience was great on all counts. The food and drinks were well prepared and executed. Starting with a mango-basil mojito, which was refreshing and moving on to the phenomenal ceviche trio. This dish was definitely the highlight of our meal, and consisted of albacore, tuna and shrimp. The seafood was extremely fresh and the multiple flavor-notes were well balanced. We also ordered the tamales, which were sweet and moist, and topped with sauteed onions and peppers and a cream sauce. For our entree, we ordered the mole trio. I figured that since Rick is always cooking moles on tv, it should be good. Out of the three, we loved the poblanos in green mole. Didn't really care for the lamb enchiladas, covered with mole and the red lamb mole. The latter mole had a bitter taste that one would expect from a sauce containing chocolate and chili, but it was not that pleasant to my palette. Guess, I am just \u00a0not a mole person !

I was in Chicago a few weeks ago and I was determined to go to Frontera Grill even if I have to wait 5 hours! I wanted to see for myself if he really is the best in whipping up Mexican Fine Dining. We just came out of Gino East for lunch and stuffed like we were never going to eat another meal, but we walked to Frontera Grill determined to make a reservation for the night (since they told us over the phone that they are no longer taking any reservations only sign-in so we actually have to physically be at the restaurant - insanity!!) You can seriously see the line out the door a mile away from Frontera Grill - we were thinking darn this place must really be good! We got there at 4pm,got in line for 20mins. sign our names and they told us to come back at 8:45pm but they still cant guarantee that a table will be open for us. WTF!!??We decided to hit some bars and wait it out. \u00a0I think we got a little bit too tipsy so we ended up getting at Frontera grill a little bit past 9pm (and was nervous that we probably wont get a table at this point) we got to the place and they sat us right away! Jackpot! The place is really very artsy with lots of Mexican masks and local mexican arts. Then on to the Menu:Ordered some cocktails right away! 1)Blackberry Mojito: vanilla-infused D'Aristi rum, fresh mint, Klug Farm blackberries, lime juice. 10.00 2)Summer Margarita: 3 Generaciones blanco tequila, muddled organic cucumber, fresh lime juice, organic cane syrup. Shaken at the table. 10.00 3)Gold Margarita: Sauza Gold tequila, Cazadores blanco tequila and Gran Torres orange liqueur steeped with fresh lime juice. 7.00 4) Mexican Mojito: fresh-squeezed lime juice, muddled fresh mint, organic cane syrup, your choice of tequila or rum and a splash of soda. 9.50All really good but not strong enough for me :))Since we were all still stuffed from Ginos we decided to get 2 appetizers and just share two Entree:Appetizers:1) Trio, Trio, Trio: a sampling of Ceviche Fronterizo, Ceviche Yucateco and Ceviche de Atun \"Chamoy.\" 16.00 \u00a0- 3 different kinds of ceviche in a martini type of glass - the seafood in each ceviche was amazing! one had shrimp, one had tuna, and one had calamari yum! it was addicting!2) Tamal de Puerco en Mole Verde: \u00a0banana leaf-steamed tamal of fresh-ground corn masa and Maple Creek braised pork. Green pumpkinseed mole, arugula salad. 7.50 \u00a0- I knew I had to order some type of Mole because that's what ulitmately what made him win Top Chef master and I swear to you, you have to order this dish! I think it had crack it was so good! lol! It was a small plate - only $7.50, I wish we ordered a few more plate of this because I can eat this on its own and Ill be a happy camper. The braised pork was so tender and juicy and the sauce was orgasmic!Entree:1) Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena: Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak, marinated in spicy red chile and wood- grilled, served with black beans, sweet plantains with sour cream, and guacamole. 29.50 \u00a0- this Carne Asada was featured in Food Network \"Best thing I ever ate\" so we had to order it and damn! I totally agree with them. It was so juicy and just melt in your mouth good! The sauce was just perfect. The Carne Asada was huge! I grew up from San Diego so I know good Carne Asada, but damn this one was really good!2) Poc Chuc de Puerco: \u00a0sour orange-marinated, grill-seared Maple Creek pork with Yucatecan garnishes: grill-roasted onions, sliced heirloom tomatoes, tangy Napa cabbage, avocado, habanero salsa, black bean \"soup.\" 23.00 \u00a0- I wanted to try another speciality so we tried their Porkchop marinated in Sour Orange. This was also recommended by the server. \u00a0It was really good too and just a tip - watch out for the little green sauce that comes with this dish - it was freakin' hot! I think it was made in Hell because it burned all of our tongue! The server warned us but silly me, i didnt believe him, i put a big spoonful of that melted fire and bam!! My mouth was on fire!!!!! it was good though lol!We had no room for desert so we decided to stop eating lol! We had the best time ever in Frontera Grill - I still dream about that Mole, im glad he doesnt have a restaurant in California otherwise I'd be 500lbs!
